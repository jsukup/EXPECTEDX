    "Understanding the similarities and differences in data is a foundational challenge to any business's data strategy. Whether it's identifying customers with shared nuances and idiosyncrasies or determining homogeneous gene sequences for cancer research, several techniques exist for grouping data -- otherwise known as clustering to the data science world or segmentation to the business world.\n",

    "One of the most commonly used methods by analytics practitioners is K-Means Clustering. Its easy-to-understand process and variety of applications make it a popular technique and probably the first (if not only) clustering method taught to statistics students. Yet for all that K-Means is good for, it isn't a panacea. Like all statistical modeling methods it has its pros, cons, and of course, underlying assumptions. Today we're going to explore alternative clustering techniques to K-Means for situations were its performance can be suboptimal."
