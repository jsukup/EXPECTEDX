Waikoloa Hilton in Kona. The grounds are beautiful, well maintained and a pleasure to stroll through. The continental breakfast was much better than what hotels typically offer. And, if that's not enough, the dolphins were amazing to watch every day. In short, we would definitely return with the hopes of repeating the same experience. ", " Stayed in the ocean tower...the view was absolutely breathtaking! This property is huge that you need a tram to get around. So much to do with the family. I spent one whole day to explore and enjoy the many things this hotel offers. ", " We stayed at one of the Hilton Waikoloa Village properties and loved it!! The staff was attentive and we had access to all of the resort. The shuttle service made it easy to move around (although we also had a rental). When staying at this property there is really no reason to venture out; there is a lagoon were you can snorkel, paddle board, and rent boats and other water toys. There is also a beach where you can sunbathe, body surf, etc. my favorite part of this resort was the peaceful atmosphere, I was able to run every morning, it was clean, the grocery store was reasonably priced, and there were plenty of restaurants on site. You can also charge to your room from many of the properties at the village. The only downside during our stay was that our car was hit overnight and had it not been because the driver reported it to the reception desk there would have been no way to track the person down and the resort was not going to own any responsibility for helping us track the information. ", " We stayed here as a family and loved the resort! My younger daughter especially loved the pool and water slide. We all enjoyed the dolphins and paid the extra to swim with them. The beds were very comfortable and so was the whole room. I'm glad we paid the extra for the Makai rooms as we were quite close to everything and also had a reserved area of lounge chairs right by the pool. Every staff member we encountered gave us excellent customer service. ", " This resort is amazing and you don't need to leave! There's a train to take you around the large property. If you'd like something different, there's a boat that takes you around! Good restaurants and facilities. A great resort. ", " I stayed here for six nights because my cousin was having her wedding at a nearby hotel. Hector was a genuine leader and was accommodating during my 6 night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. He helped clarify the small issues that I had during my stay and helped brighten my day. The Ocean Tower is the farthest from everything and is currently being transformed into timeshares through Hilton Grand Vacations. There is a tram that runs every 15 mins that gets you to where you need to go as well as a boat too. Vanessa was a great server at the Water's Edge restaurant. She was very attentive and caring during my whole stay. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is not only vast and big but you should not let that throw your guard off when it comes to getting away for peace, relaxation and quiet time. I have been in the service industry for 28 years and my experience was beyond expectations. Check in was smooth painless and so welcoming as they understood we had just flown over 16 hours to get there. Exhausted, needed to get some food and although their Foyer Venue outlet was the only one open late, it was pleasant comfortable and the servers were spot on understanding we wanted to relax and get some quick bites....and they were just delicious....and i am a vegetarian!The rooms are beautiful and the views from pretty much everywhere are breath taking. No better alarm clock then to wake up to the Hawaiian ocean breeze and the sound of the most beautiful birds chirping away. The concierge are ready to rock at any time and will acknowledge you all the time, even if you don't need them. They have millions of recommendations for all; from the families that want things for all to the most demanding who want adventure and retreat (us :-) Breakfast outlet is beautiful and the service on point; our server (forgot her name) recognized us daily and made us feel just at home. The pools, Lagoon, walkways, beaches all and all is just breath taking and you can even take the time for meditation among he most amazing sunsets.The Hote'ls Luau....is a well oiled machine (trust me I watched all) great food, amazing performances under starry skies...just wonderful...oh the memories!All and all this hotel continues to rock the Polynesian Islands!! Enjoy it! ", " Beautiful hotel in a beautiful place. We had a clean room w/somewhat of a view. We loved it, the service was top notch from the maid to the check-in staff. Breakfast buffet was wonderful w/a view of the grounds. Food was expensive but you have to remember you are in Hawaii. We did walk (2 miles round trip) to the Kings/Queens shopping center for a few meals and it was cheaper than the hotel. Also they have a shuttle bus that will take you for $2. one way if you're not a walker. We had a cabana by the pool and we camped out for the day, we went to a Luau on the property, we rode the boat around the property in the evening and the tram or walked during the day. They have everything you could want to do 7 then some. ", " The Hilton Waikaloa is bar none the most beautiful resort we have ever stayed at. The staff is attentive and the property is impeccable. Be prepared to not want to ever leave! Dining options are $$$ so mamke sure you plan ahead. There are plenty of options off property. ", " Amazing family hotel. We had an awesome experience. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and facilities were in excellent condition. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great family vacation, with tons to do. ", " Our family loved this resort and all the amenities. This is one of our favorite places. We will be back. The dolphin quest, the restaurants and the local attractions just add to this experience. The views are incredible and the service is impeccable. ", " This places has everything you would want ranging from several food choices, swimming with dolphins and turtles and all sorts of ocean life creatures from there lagoon. They have an amazing luau, friendly staff, affordable shopping and great food ", " We stayed here twice with our kids and loved it. The monorail and boat that take you from one end of the hotel to the other were so fun for the kids. The hotel itself is nice and the rooms are good--nothing over the top special, but totally fine. The lagoon is so much fun and so safe for the kids, and it was fun to rent all the water toys. It's important to note that the hotel doesn't actually have a beach. It's only a few minute walk to a public beach, and a pretty nice one. The place was very friendly and just a safe environment for kids. People did tend to put their towels on chairs all day and never move them, but we've found that to be true at all resports we've visited. ", " A huge resort that has almost everything you need. Great rooms. Amazingly helpful staff even after we had checked out. We needed a late check out due to our flight time. They helped us with the best option that wasn't about them making money so that was refreshing. ", " After a slight glitch upon checking in (which ace front desk clerk Nick quickly resolved!), we were able to spend a wonderful stay at this huge property. The trams were great in bringing us to the Ocean Tower, the room was spacious and clean, and the property activities were so inviting. Although certain parts of the property are not easily accessible if on crutches, it was still enjoyable. The staff are nice too! Use the valet parking (same price as self parking), and take that shuttle to the Queens or Kings Marketplace! ", " This was our 2nd trip here to the Hilton Waikoloa Village...1st trip was in 2006. We truly had another amazing stay. This trip we had our 8 year old with us & we used more of the hotel amenities because of that. She truly loved the pool, lagoon, and Dolphin Quest. The staff was so very friendly...especially Rose and Lululana at breakfast. We can't wait until our next visit back to the Big Island. ", " My family of 3 and two other families all stayed here and had a great time. Fantastic pool with water slide. We snorkeled in the lagoon with the turtles. Beautiful view. Room refrigerator very small. Convenient towel service at pool. Comfortable beds. Small convenience store on site. Many restaurants and pool bar were great. Close to shopping and restaurants. ", " It was a great hotel especially with kids! Have tons of things to do! Rooms are good. Staff are all friendly. I mostly like the ice cream bar, love the ube flavor! The lagoon area is our favorite! you can swim, snorkel, paddle board etc. I recommend the Makai & Palace towers. I recommend this hotel to everyone! ", " After our recent anniversary stay, my wife and I were thrilled about the resort, it's facilities, and it's team. Mr. Givens and his staff took fantastic care of my wife and I and our friends with whom we were traveling, even going as far as to offer us a complimentary room upgrade and welcome/anniversary gift. Really, they went above and beyond as they made us feel like valued guests--especially in such a mega resort. HWV is truly the \"Disneyland\" of Hawaiian resorts, and we were so grateful for the wonderful experience we had while we were on the Big Island. We cannot imagine staying at a better resort, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing, yet fun-filled vacation. Thank you to all at HWV who made our dream anniversary trip so meaningful! ", " 5 Star Service. I was a little worried that we'd be treated like \"another' tourist, but I could not have been more wrong. We were treated like royalty. The views were amazing. The food was great. We will be back. ", " It was an outstanding experience for my first time in HI. People was very friendly and the property was one of the best I have ever stayed. I had included on my package continental breakfast and was more than enough for us during our mornings. The variety of food was of the charts. We also had dinner on two of their restaurants and the food was really good with reasonable prices. I will definitely come back. ", " I highly recommend this property. I would have been content staying at the property the majority of our trip. The only recommendation I have is to go to the market to get snacks and drinks for your room. The food options are slim on property especially in the morning and evening. ", " Great hotel with all of the amenities!! This is the nicest Hilton that I have ever stayed at. It features both a boat and tram through the property. The only downsize is that Diamond members only get 2 complementary breakfast coupons for Continental breakfast only.. not ideal for a family ", " The Hilton Waikiloa Village was great! It is a large hotel but there are trams and fun boats that take you around the resort. Lots of places to eat here and the rooms are nice. The best part for us was the lagoon. You can snorkel or do other water activities right in the lagoon at the hotel. There are many types of fish and even turtles come in to the lagoon because it feeds off of the ocean. You can also swim in one of the many pools (adult only as well) and go down the water slide! The included breakfast each day is also very good. This would be a great place to visit with children or just as a couple. Highly recommend! ", " I have been coming here for over 15 years as this hotel has everything a business person or family could want. The rooms are quiet and spacious. They are also surprisingly quiet so you can sleep in or work. The hotel has a great breakfast buffet and many great amenities including an amazing lagoon with sea turtles. The dolphin experience is once in a lifetime and you and your family will remember this experience forever. Its why I keep coming back! ", " We've been here 5+ times. The hotel is fabulous! From snorkeling in the lagoon to dolphin quest to walking the property, it's been wonderful. Everything is self contained and there is no reason to leave the property. ", " Amazing vacation on the Big Island at a resort so well thought out that sunset is the perfect end to a perfect day. Mornings at Big Island Breakfast started most of our days. When we weren't visiting the island we swam with dolphins and sea turtles or under a waterfall in huge swimming pool. The Marble statues throughout the grounds were custom made for the resort in China and they were mined from a single quarry in white, green, black, and red. One word - Amazing. ", " Aloha,Two thumbs up and kudos to the staff at the Hilton Waikoloa.We arrived early at 12:30 pm and really appreciated that our room was ready, though not expected. Kudos to Elizabeth at the front desk who checked us in. She was in training, but was very methodical in ensuring she covered all the necessary bases, and made us very welcome.Though we had limited interaction with other staff, that was not a bad thing as were there to relax and unwind, however the valet staff were always on top of it as were the other staff when requested.We were pleasantly surprised with the extensive array of Pacific Rim art work and artifacts located along the walkways between the buildings. Though I had looked at various websites to include the official Hilton website, I didn\u2019t see any reference to it, though I may have missed it. The monorail connecting the buildings is where we heard there were more than 1800 articles on display. Though we don\u2019t have a vested interest in Hilton, I suggested to the General Manager that this is promoted, whether it is on the Hilton website, or even as a hand-out at check in. I had never seen a collection quite like it. It was quite impressive.Though the resort is geographically expansive it is very navigable as there is a monorail connecting the various buildings that runs all day to include early morning as well as a boat shuttling patrons between buildings after 2 pm.We won\u2019t hesitate to visit again on our next trip to Kona, Hawaii.Mahola to the staff at the Hilton Waikoloa ", " We three generations of females all feel this was the best place we could have chosen. Beautiful room, watching dolphins, lovely restaurants and on and on. The staff were all top notch and helpful. Some of us will be back. ", " We went the last week if June and it was wonderful! The hotel was clean and comfortable and the signs were clear so it was easy to find different areas. The view from the Makai Lagoon tower was a classic postcard view, ocean was beautiful. Everyone was pleasant and we had exceptional service. There are so many birds to watch on the grounds, really pretty ones we don't see at home. The trams and boats make getting around easy and are a cool way to see the sights. The pools and hot tubs were awesome. ", " We stayed at Makai at Lagoon tower here and it was totally worth it. Access to the Kohala Spa and the separate pool lounge area with soft chairs alone make it worth it. - Note the Spa amenities are not co-ed, slightly disappointing that my wife and I couldn't do a steam room or the private hot tub together.We ate breakfast at the buffet every day and it was delicious. Chris making 5 omelets at a time is impressive, and delicious.Nick went out of his way to make sure our family of 10 had a great time. We loved the rooms, the views, the food, the people, the activities, the outdoor hot tubs at night, and the location in relation to our offsite adventures. ", " This was our second stay at the Hilton Waikoloa resort and it lived up to our memories of the first visit. The staff, the rooms, the facility far exceeded our expectations. We love the lagoon area and the lagoon grill. Where else can you enjoy a meal while watching dolphins play. Every staff member were ready to assist or answer questions. We also had a 3rd room at the Kings Land Hilton Vacation Club which is on property. I do not recommend it. Stay at Waikoloa Resort!!! They are the best!!! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa was perfect- the room, the view, the helpful staff all made it enjoyable. The resort has something for everyone- great pool, the lagoon, and grounds. We enjoyed the art and exotic birds on the grounds. It works well for a family or couple. ", " There aren't too many hotels/resorts that have shuttle boats and trains to move guests around their properties, but this is one of them. The scale of this resort is immense. If you're staying in one of the three guest towers, you won't know the others exist unless you take one of the transports or like to walk.The front desk representative was excellent. I asked about getting an upgrade, based on an email I had received the week before my stay. She looked at my Hilton Honors profile, and remarked about how many nights I had stayed at Hilton properties. She assigned me to a beautiful lagoon view room in the Makai tower -- the one closest to the lobby. The room was clean and very comfortable. Internet service was included in the daily resort fee. The speed and connection quality were more than adequate.My biggest complaint was with the upcharge for the breakfast at the breakfast buffet restaurant. As a Diamond Honors guest, I get free continental breakfast. I haven't been to another Hilton where that didn't include hot buffet items, and neither the hostess nor the server mentioned the upcharge until after I had returned with hot items. Then, I found out that the upcharge was much higher than the prices on the menu for the continental and full breakfast buffets. I found it amazing that no other Honors guest has complained about this to the management before -- at least that's what the manager said after I complained. I wouldn't have had a problem paying the menu's price differential, but the difference was almost twice that.In spite of that, we had a wonderful vacation. We especially enjoyed the water slide at the Makai pool. ", " We didn't stay here but because we stayed at King's Land, we could use their facilities. What a great place. there is a boat ride through the resort. Swim with the dolphins, dine ate the restaurants, make a reservation for the Luau, do it all while you have the opportunity. Great combination with King's Land. ", " We had an all girls trip to Waikaloa and we stayed at Hilton Waikaloa, we Jada fabulous time. We were in the Palace Tower and the room was spacious, nicely done and comfortable. We enjoyed the different pools and ate at a few of the restaurants on property and enjoyed it all. The KonaColada's are super yummy and I would recommend it to everyone. The pupu's at the Kona Tap Room were really ono! We had a blast and will definitely go back. ", " My wife and I booked this trip about 9 months ahead and then multiple family member asked if they could join us at Waikoloa Village. With the larger goop it make sense to upgrade to a suite instead of multiple rooms and and as a Hilton honers member i was offered some great value upgrade options. My wife worked with the onsite staff to get a high floor large suite. She did a great job! Wow, we had a great suite with both mountain and oceanic views in the Place Tower. This is a true resort and if you like to stay at this type of venue, it is great with much to do for the family. One challenge is that the Big Island has much to do outside of the resort. There are rental cars available onsite to solve this issue and during our stay we did book cars several times for long island trips. Cheers and have a good trip to the big island! ", " We stayed in the Makai tower with our two boys aged 8 and 4. The location was good and the youngest enjoyed the tram rides. We walked around the resort a lot which was good considering the food we ate here! There are not a lot of healthy options after breakfast which is perhaps a downfall but we got around it. The Kona pool and the lagoon were great to swim and play in and being Makai guests we could always find a chair, it was just not always right next to the pool. Yes the resort is expensive, we expected that, but it was till a shock to pay almost $100 USD for lunch for four of us with two hot dogs, two sandwiches and two drinks.... The room was spacious and clean and really suited our needs. A few extra power points or even USB chargers would be helpful for those of us from outside the US.  ", " We weren't staying here, but at the Kolea villas next door, but we got to take advantage of the pools here. The kids loved riding the monorail and seeing the dolphins and walking along the beach. There are many pools to choose from. Kids liked the kiddie slides and sand beach pool. ", " A gem in the hilton portfolio. Beats out Hilton Grand Wailea. Hilton Waikoloa Village has real dolphins, For example, Hilton Grand Wailea has statues of dolphins. Fabulous lagoon with large turtles, jumping fish, great snorkling. 3 hotels - Tower, Ocean, Palace- linked by boat and train. Wonderfal ambiance. Millions in art work. Had incredible lagoon, grounds and ocean view in 6th floor room in Ocean Tower. First room had golf and ocean view, but had excessive noise when wind blew. Was able to get new room without trouble. Used Hilton points -50,000 per nite with 5th nite free. A deal! Be prepared for sticker shock for food prices. Continental breakfast was $24 with $15 to upgrade. Fortunately, had free breakfast with HHonors. food also expensive (like 2 x mainland) in groceries. If you go to Hilo, you can buy cheaper food to eat in you room. Lunch and dinner prices were stratospheric A few cheaper restaurants around but you will have to drive. Snorking equipment rental expensive. Maui was $9 per day. Here, $25 per half day. Bring your own. Access parking lot with room key, If key doesn't work, buzz valet. Unfortunately, valet may be busy. Then you must go in behind somebody else (I did) and go to front desk to redo your key. Kona airport is a delight. Small, relaxed, plaza in middle, simple security, small lines. Maui airport not so much anymore. ", " Our family of 5 couples vacationed here and loved this beautiful property! The private cove is perfect for snorkeling--saw turtles, eels, and many fish. There are so many swimming pools to choose from. The food was so good at all of the restaurants at the resort. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our rooms and beds were very comfortable. Favorites: the Kahola Spa, the Cookie Ice cream Sandwich, Walking the beautiful paths at sunset, Snorkeling by the waterfall, watching the torch lighting each evening, the and the amazing buffet breakfast. ", " We took a family trip to the big island of Hawaii this summer. Our accommodations were in the Hilton at Waikaloa. The facility is excellent and the staff was fabulous. It is a bit pricey, but sure was nice. ", " We loved our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. The grounds are beautiful. There were several excellent swimming options and the kids enjoyed Dolphin Quest. The staff and service were top notch, so it's a good value for the money. Also, we loved the tram boats. The best dining experiences were Dona & Toni's and Legends of the Pacific. ", " The best resort I have ever stayed in!!! You could spend a week there and never finish seeing the resort yet you feel at home. The dolphin experience, canal boat rides, tropical fish and water sports in the private lagoon and beautiful pools are just the beginning of how amazing this place is! ", " We spent 8 nights here and loved the facilities. The pools and lagoon were wonderful. The on property boats and trams were fun to catch (when you could catch them). The Dolphin quest was truly worth every penny and it is on property. Room was great. View was great. The only thing I had to get used to was the on property food prices. I would definitely stay here again. ", " Just returned from Hilton Waikoloa Beach Resort. I can't say enough about how fantastic the property is spread over 62 acres. Tram and canal boat makes getting around very easy. Lots of water sports activity and, of course, the dolphin enclosure. Restaurants are lacking but plenty of options. We journeyed to Kona, itself for many of our meals. New Saddle Road made Hilo within an easy drive. We would stay here again. ", " Grounds beautiful like the birds. Ocean view and access good. Displays on the main floors. About Japan statues. The Hawaiian culture very interesting.The Dolphins inhabit was wonderful and staff very nice and gave a lot of information on the care. ", " A spectacular resort. A neat, clean room with amenities and good housekeeping . We stayed in the palace tower and that was a good central location in walking distance to the great lagoon where you can hire paddle boards, little boats etc and swim with the fish and turtles. There is also dolphin quest where we had a chance to swim with dolphins. The water slide was great fun and we went to the Luau which was a bit of fun, food and entertainment. It's first in best dressed so get there 30 mins before the time they tell you if you want a more forward spot as its busy. It's buffet style (which is personal taste as to whether this is your thing). I found the cocktails to be average but I guess that's expected when pre-preparing and serving many people. The restaurant (PKG) on the point is exceptional if you dine outside, especially at sunset! What a view and I thought the food and service was great. The resort is big so be prepared to move around by monorail or boat ad to wait for these transport options. Take the trolley out to the shops a short ride away if you want supplies or alternative food options. We loved this resort and will definitely be back... Neat, clean rooms, great activities, good housekeeping and friendly staff. Water pressure in the shower could however be better! ", " As I mentioned in previous reviews, this is the only resort I go to. On 6/1 it marked my 16th year of staying at this BEAUTIFUL resort. Amazing sunsets and sunrises. What is more amazing? The employees and management team make you feel like you are a member of their Ohana. Service is better than exceptional. I will go back in the fall. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a huge property on 62 acres. The tram and boat is available to take you to your tower. You're in Hawaii, walking to the different pools is so nice! The grounds are well maintained and the variety of wildlife they have on property is amazing!Upon check in, we were greeted with Aloha by Nick, Kelly and Samie. Wonderful front desk staff! We had 2 rooms in the Ocean Tower that had spectacular rooms of the ocean. I've read poor reviews of the hotel from the rooms and how things were far and the boats and trams being slow? Note to self...we're here to create memories so I wouldn't let that discourage my vacation. Get out and enjoy what the Hilton Waikoloa has to offer. It's an adventure to remember.We have 4 teenage boys from Utah, 3 of them first time to Hawaii. They were impressed with the pools, the tram, dolphins and man made lagoon. They found activities to do throughout the stay. Just a short description of our experience because I need to join my family in the pools right now. Thank you Hilton Waikoloa for an awesome family vacation to remember! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is pure Hawaii Aloha Magic! A stunning resort with superb accommodations, a total family atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent food options and restaurants, the Dolphin encounter, an open Ocean Lagoon, a Monorail, canal boat transportation to your room and beauty, beauty, beauty! The Luau is a true Hawaiian experience with a great show and fire dancers. This resort is all about the family and your children, young and old, having an amazing experience. It's fun, gorgeous, romantic and an incredible value. This was our 14th visit and it just keeps getting better! ", " This hotel is a must stay if you are visiting the Big Island of Hawaii! The rooms were clean, spacious, and beautiful. Everyone there was so friendly and helpful! The pools, restaurants, and spa are incredible. I didn't want to leave! ", " My sister and I stayed at the Hilton Waikaloa from May 13-18 and we absolutely loved it! I was there 14 years ago, and it was my sister's first time to Hawaii. The entire stay was magical. When I think of Hawaii, I always plan to stay at the Hilton. The facility, ALL staff, and everything about it are second to none! ", " A very nice retreat if you are young. The flight from the mid west is long an arduous. I did notice the general absence of older vacationers. So my advice would be to be a person of 50 or less to do Hawaii. ", " We had a fabulous time. The hotel was very clean, smelled very nice. The walk to and from all the different buildings was pleasant. Things tended to shut down around 9:30 or so, but it seems that is the way on all the islands. ", " We had a great stay. The experience was absolutely wonderful and the spa was above and beyond. We us the complimentary spa everyday. You can not go wrong staying here!! We also did the luau, \"Legends of Hawaii\", and it was a wonderful! Hats off to the Master of ceremonies! ", " Hotel property is at one of the best locations on the island, with great sunset views. We had perfect weather every day (sunny, light breeze), so didn't spend much time in our room - which was comfortable, and had beautiful ocean view. The grounds and amenities are well maintained. The lighting of the torches every evening was interesting, as was the private lagoon, dolphin experience, and luau. There are many options for food and beverages on property, as well as close by. All in all a wonderful experience, enhanced with friendly and helpful staff. We look forward to returning soon. ", " After a two day trek of way too many flights being cancelled, delayed and rescheduled, my new husband and I made it to the Hilton Waikoloa for our honeymoon. We arrived exhausted around midnight and have been impressed from that moment on. The grounds are huge and there is something for everyone! We loved that one side of the hotel is quiet and has the old Hawaii feel to it. The other side of the hotel has waterfalls and so many fun activities for kids, so whatever your vacation entails, this place can make it happen. I've been going to Maui every year for 27 years so this was my first time to the big island and I'm in love with it! I read reviews about the walk around the hotel being super long but we didn't mind it at all. Our room in the Ocean Tower was literally the farthest point away from the front entrance as possible but it really wasn't a bad walk. Plus they have trams you can take if you're not feeling up for it. We did have a few complications with our fridge not working and had to be switched out 4 times but everyone was so kind and helpful, it was really not a problem. We ended up extending our stay here and after we did, I spoke to Jesse at the front desk who went out of his way to ensure the rest of our stay was even better. He was so nice to speak with and even though I could tell they were busy, I did not feel rushed as he genuinely was interested in hearing what I had to say while providing great feedback to all of my questions. I actually downloaded the trip advisor app just to write a review on him and this hotel. For those who love to snorkel and if you're feeling adventurous, we walked to the black sand beach just up this lava rock path and the snorkeling was out of this world! You can also drive there but we preferred to explore the coast line and scenery. The downfall of this hotel is the $27/night self parking. My husband is a diamond member with Hilton and spends more nights in a Hilton throughout the year for work than he does at home and still they wouldn't comp our parking. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel. From the tiki torch lighting to the breathtaking sunsets, to the turtles and dolphins on the premises, what's not to like.  ", " We stayed here four days as part of a three island trip. The resort was excellent. Lots of things for families to do from....several pools, two small waterslides, \"Dolphin Quest,\" multiple restaurants etc. etc. The only negatives ....if you can call it that was not really a beach swim friendly place....but the lagoon was a nice alternative. Also,several times the tram was all full. Once we got on a boat as an alternative but at the next stop the boat went out of service...there was no sign and we weren't told when when got on or we wouldn't have...Minor thing. Overall it was an excellent resort. ", " Well it's five star hotel. We had a beautiful suite in the Palace tower, actual living room separate bedroom, very spacious and comfortable. Check in staff at honors desk very astute and anticipated every question, all of the staff just excellent. The art work in the walkway to the Palace tower worth a visit in itself.  Why the \"but\"? It's way too big. It caters to children , which is fine but know it going in. They have activities galore for kids that take place everywhere in the resort. The resort is a little isolated. They have a free shuttle and another local shuttle that take you down to a couple of small shopping center that have a supermarket. Other than that it's the resort, Hilton timeshares and owned condos. So most people have a car. Exorbinent prices to park. We valeted for $37 per. I'm not the type that likes to stay on property for any long period of time, so my perspective may be different. ", " When my wife booked us at the Hilton, we didn't realize how beautiful and comprehensive a resort it is. It is a very large property but Hilton has done a good job making everything accessible with a train and a boat, though we didn't generally use them because they come infrequently and we preferred to walk. The views of the Pacific and the rocky coast are stunning. Since there isn't a natural beach, the hotel has created one in a small lagoon that connects to the Pacific. We like to walk and there are lots of paths around the property, where it can take 30 minutes or more to walk all the way around. There are also nice gym facilities. We were looking forward to sleeping, due to our busy schedules and found the hotel very quiet at night. We enjoyed our stay very much. ", " My husband and I rarely get to have time away so staying at the Hilton was a treat. It is a beautiful property with an accommodating staff. We would be happy to stay again!Take advantage of the car rental and peruse the island. There is a lot to see.Wish we would have had a few more days here and would have added some golfing and poolside time. Rooms are quiet. A bit of a walk to breakfast if you don't want to take the train. ", " Cannot say enough about this wonderful experience! The Aloha greeting at valet, warm smiles at front desk, hello from all staff, cheerfulness of tram and boat staff, excellent food options, cleanliness, not over crowded, lots of water options! The sunset dinner at KPC was the highlight of our weeks stay! Five stars! ", " This resort makes for a wonderful vacation stay. It all begins the moment you walk in the main entrance and the tone is set- open and inviting and relaxed. The staff throughout our stay were all extremely courteous, helpful and professional. The staff of both the front desk as we checked in & checked out and the tour desk in planning our excursions to night-diving with manta rays and snorkeling at the bay where Captain Cooke Monument stands - both of which I highly recommend- were especially helpful and accommodating.The room was definitely up to Hilton standards in terms of design and decoration. It was also extremely clean and the cleaning staff kept it that way throughout our3 night stay.The grounds and pools are beautiful and we especially enjoyed seeing the flamingos each time we came and went to the pool from our room. And the fascinating art collection lining the walk throughout the property was very enjoyable and we appreciated seeing it as we came and went.We didn't take advantage of the restaurants on-site but the Hilton breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the on-site coffee shop was convenient and loved their signature coffee!!We spent much of our time during the day off-property snorkeling and exploring and this property is conveniently located to these day trips around the Big Island.I highly recommend this Hilton and would definitely stay again when I come back to the Big Island!! ", " From the time we checked in until our reluctant departure this was an incredible vacation spot. Kelly checked us in. She was so kind, helpful and professional. It set the tone for the rest of our trip. The views were magnificent. The room was above the dolphin area every time we were in our room. The laua was one of the best shows I've seen. The food at breakfast was delicious and the wait staff was so friendly and helpful. We love to travel, but this is by far one of our favorite places to come for the wonderful island view and friendly people. I can't wait until next time. ", " Our weekend getaway was perfect! Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond our expectations (very courteous, accommodating) and made our stay memorable. Thank you for all your hard work! ", " Hilton at Waikoloa Village is a great place to stay. Service was excellence and the facility was clean. It is an all inclusive resort and it is close to shopping shopping area and restaurants. My only concern was we needed a car to visit surrounding areas. However, there is a car rental at the resort. ", " We stayed in Hilton Waikoloa for 4 nights during April 2015. A vast property adjacent to beautiful beaches. The resort itself cannot be toured in a day! It has trains and boats running inside from one end to the other end. The room service is a bit delayed. Else everything else was superb! ", " Visited for a conference and took family. Room in Ma'kai area overlooking dolphin adventure. Watched them play every morning. Tram and boat rides thru resort great but don't really need them. Food is expensive. Yes there is a marketplace to buy and malls a short shuttle away. Lagoon was fantastic!!!! Sea turtles,colorful fish all linked to the ocean so it's an amazing location. Pools great too. Only downfall was restaurant food costs but to be expected....food was good though. Hilton Gold members get 2 free breakfasts daily FYI. ", " AWESOME place to stay. No need to leave the resort! They have restaurants, pools, spa, lagoon, dolphins, tram, boat rides, even shopping on the premises. The grounds are so peaceful, especially early in the mornings for a nice am walk. We've been visiting this resort for over 20 years now. Paradise in Paradise. ", " I have had the Good Fortune to stay at this Beautiful Resort twice.. each time for 10 days or so. Except for a few of the popular island must-see's, you never have to leave. Mike, Nick and Jessica @ the HHonors desk.. made everything happen, and my expectations have always been exceeded. Thanks to Jessie and countless others. ", " We thoroughly enjoyed the entire resort and felt that we became very familiar with it from one end to the other. Great resort for every personal situation from business conventions to family vacations. We found ourselves being a tour guide of sorts for those that had just arrived at the hotel. ", " This is a lovely vacation resort. It is thoughtfully put together with something for everyone. My husband had flashbacks to Disney World with the water taxi and tram transportation availability. Walking under a waterfall on the way to the dolphins was just more of the magic. We sat and had refreshments as we watched the dolphins perform. Families could sign up to actually get into the water and play with the dolphins. We did not stay in the hotel but rather in one of the Hilton vacation properties, King's Land, which has a shuttle to and from the main resort and the two shopping centers on the resort grounds. I definitely recommend it. ", " I know that this is an expensive resort, but it was the best resort that I have been to. The grounds are fantastic. Lots of swimming pools and they cater for differently abled persons as well (mechanical chairs available at some of the pools). Great for kids - lots of activities. Shopping and less expensive food is available a short shuttle ride away. But a fabulous sunset dinner can be had at the KPC Restaurant as well. Great sunsets.... Helicopter tours of the island are available just outside of the main entrance / road taking you to the resort. Lava tubes and the lava club is also located close by. It was my first visit to the island and I totally enjoyed it. I am happy I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and I look forward to staying there again some time. ", " Stayed here while my family was visiting from California and it was pretty fun from the boat tram to the regular train tram taking us to one side of the huge hotel. Really like the swimming pool they have for kids and adults and the adult one has a water slide which was awesome. Rooms are nice and the employees courteous. Only thing I didn't like is the food at the hotel but the breakfast buffet was fine. I'd definitely come back. ", " We took our son there for his 13th birthday. The resort is huge. Great place to be, endless things to do. Great resort to walk a lot and stay fit. We are pretty self-sufficient therefore never needed room service nor front desk. I have tried multiple restaurants, shops, etc. Service were acceptable and courteous. However, I was craving for some caffeinated drink, and went to their coffee hut. Service wasn't friendly. I thought perhaps they were tired out or someone didnt show up for work; until someone showed up, holy molly the server cracked a big smile and chatted away like she saw a prince charming or something. LOL. My conclusion, she chose to be friendly selectively. I will never go back again, ever. :/ ", " The resort was absolutely fabulous! Accommodations were clean, spacious, and comfortable. The resort property was beautiful and well maintained. The only thing it really lacked was a good old sand beach, but there was certainly enough beach atmosphere at the pools to make up for the lack of sand on the ocean. The staff were amazing! Usually in a weeks time you will find at least one person who is having a bad da -, we never did find that one person. Every employee we met, dealt with, or observed, was absolutely helpful, friendly, and willing to do anything they could to make our stay top notch. I don't know what kind of training Hilton puts them through, but it is certainly working! Raquel, concierge, was superior - her smile, outgoing personality, and can do attitude was such a pleasure! ", " We had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Hilton Waikola Resort. For those who are not experienced snorkelers their lagoon will be a great first time experience. Bring your own gear and save a few dollars on rental equipment. Both times in the lagoon saw two to three sea turtles, a lot of colorful fish, clams and even a colorful eel who was way more scared of me than me of it. Breakfast is bountiful, but you may wait a few minutes to be seated and then you are really on your own to enjoy the conftinental buffer or upgrade to their hot options. Be sure to try the local breads and the Papaya. Also the resort offers transportation to the beach which is five minutes by van and about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The lagoon is cool, but you will likely long for a sand beach and many people think they need to leave Waikola to go to one of the State Park Beaches, but in reality there is a beach within minutes and be sure to take in the Lava Lava a beach bar restaurant with seating in the san for sunset dinner or just libation.Also if you dine or go to the ocean front walk by Hilton's KPC Restaurant just before sunset you can enjoy an amazing sunset and also watch a Hawaiian native (I hope) sound the shell and then run the property lighting the torches that follow along the entire ocean edge walk from KPC to the Ocean Tower.The only downside is the distance of some rooms from the lobby. The resort has a train and boat system to make travel more efficient, but the train can be finicky. I recommend the boat system if you are not in a rush.The staff is very welcoming and this is appreciated considering the size to the resort and the large number of intersections each person has with differing guests. We found all the employees to have that Aloha spirit and very welcoming and hospitable! ", " The stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village was awesome! We were greeted warmly and enjoyed the beauty of the grounds as well as the wonderful room. Staff were so attentive. The Big Island Breakfast was over the top good. The moonlight swim in the Lagoon pool with the moon and starlit palms was peaceful and one of our favorite memories. There are so many things to see and do. Its a great place to stay for touring the Big Island or as a destination. ", " I have been here twice now with my parents (I'm almost twenty), and this resort can't do no wrong. The staff are welcoming and accommodating, and the resort itself transports you to a whole other world of flora and brilliant art. One of my favorite things to do was hang by the lagoon which is fed from the ocean, and usually if you snorkel in it you'll see some sea turtles. Truly, the reason my family and I have not stayed anywhere else when we travel to the Big Island is the ambience and location of the resort never ceases to fill us with wonder and awe. It is paradise, at least for us. And it's just a bit north of Kona, but not too much of a drive. As I said, the resort is dotted with amazing flora and art, so take the time to walk around. Also, don't worry about the cats! They help keep the rodent population on the low, and they mind their own business. ", " This place is amazing! The Makai tower is the best location!! Close to Kona pool, Dolphins... short walk to lobby. Views amazing and plenty to do at resort. We stayed a week. The Lagoon is magical... so fun to hang out there. My son loved the pool slide at the Kona pool. The property is breathtaking. Staff was wonderful. ", " Let me just say...this property was outstanding! Yes, there is lots of walking but that has never bothered me. If you don't want to walk, there is a tram that operates and a boat too! Yes, I said a boat! There are screens throughout the resort that tell you when the tram or boat will arrive; the screens also indicate which direction the tram or boat is headed, which is a plus. FOOD: yes, the food can be expensive. But, that's something you should assume going to Hawaii. Tidbit: everything that is shipped to Hawaii, must go through the port of LA. Even if this includes items being shipped from China; these too must go to LA and then to HI. With that said, you can eat there affordably. There is a shuttle that operates; the cost was $2/person/each way. The shuttle can take you to King's Shops and Queen's Market Place. Queen's has a grocery store, albeit a condensed grocery store. If you wish, you could rent a car (expect to pay $115 to rent a car at the resort for 24 hours- there is a National Car Rental onsite) and drive to Wal-Mart and do your grocery shopping there. The fridge in the room is small and there isn't really a \"freezer\" section. And yes, you would have to weigh the cost of renting a car to get your groceries vs. paying the shuttle to Queen's vs. paying for the buffet breakast at Hilton. The buffet is about $35 per person; not cheap. I would recommend taking the shuttle to Queen's and purchasing breakfast items there. If you must, there is a store close to Na Hoku (the jewelry store) where you can purchase milk, juice, soda, and snack items. The Orchid Marketplace is located next to the pool by MAKAI at Lagoon Tower; you could order salad, pizza, hot dogs, etc. and it's priced reasonably. The Lagoon Grill wasn't pricey either. Dinner is the tricky meal. It's definitely more expensive than stateside. However, if you can afford to eat at KPC, which provides a gorgeous view of the Pacific Ocean while you dine, I would recommend it. Please see their menu on Hilton's website. ROOM: We stayed in a room at MAKAI at Lagoon Tower. What a view! I would highly recommend booking a room with an ocean view; definitely worth it! The beds and pillows were very comfortable. We controlled the temperature easily; if you open the door to your balcony, the AC/heat shuts off. Makes sense. We had no issues with hearing our neighbors. But again, this was not their busy season. In our room, we were given 2 bottles of water every day that we let housekeeping in. Wi-fi is free for Hilton Honors guests. I would recommend setting up an account before your stay here. And the view...did I mention how gorgeous they were?? We were by the dolphin pool, too, which made it enjoyable. Part of the price of our room included complimentary use of the spa's sauna and whirlpool and showers. The whirlpool for women was beautiful! Although the whirlpools by the pool were much warmer. If you opt to shower here, they have everything you need to get cleaned up afterwards: shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hair gel, hair dryers. POOL: We stayed in May and the pool was not busy. Yes, there were children there, but the resort and pool areas were not crowded. Warning: it is sunny just about every day so bring lots and lots of sunscreen and other items to protect yourself. You can rent a cabana by the pool (seats 2) for $85 each day. It includes a safe and a cooler. They add 2 bottles of water and ice to your cooler. In addition, they came around with cold washcloths for us to use in the afternoon; each is individually wrapped in plastic. Alcoholic drinks were about $15. If you stay in the MAKAI at Lagoon Tower, there is reserved seating by the pool. A few of the chairs are under cover (a cloth tent). But get there early as those seats are scooped up quickly. Besides these seats or renting a cabana, most seats are directly in the sun. ROOM SERVICE: Avoid it if at all possible. They attach a 22% fee AND a $10 \"administrative fee\" (I believe that's what they called it). PROPERTY: It is rather expansive and the staff work hard to maintain it. You will definitely get your exercise here! Please be sure to walk the property. Lots to see...lots of pictures to take! One final suggestion: if you want, King's Shops and Queen's Market Place are within walking distance. If you are looking to do grocery shopping, take the shuttle. But if you want to do souvenir shopping, I would suggest walking. I would say it would be a leisure walk of about 20 minutes. But there are sidewalks and gorgeous views to enjoy along the way. Overall, I would recommend staying here and I would definitely stay here again. If you rent a car, please check out their daily parking fee; I think it was $27. If you are a Costco member, check out Costco's Travel website for deals and then, as always, comparison shop. Had an absolutely fabulous time here! ", " I just celebrated 18 years of marriage in the Ocean Tower at Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort. This tower is one of many (Makai, Palace Tower) hotels in an exceptional resort. Upon entering the grand lobby you are welcomed by attentive Hilton Clerks and then can proceed to your room by walking/ tram/ or boat! Depending on which tower you are in you can use boats and trams to come to and from your hotel room and the main lobby. If you don't want to wait about 10-15 minutes you can always walk the connecting corridors and enjoy some of the most exceptional Asian art ever displayed! This resort has a multitude of beautifully groomed swimming pools in exotic immaculate gardens. There are also restaurants and coffee shops throughout the this village. If the prices are too high for your budget, which I thought they were even for Hawaii, you are just a short five minute drive to Queens Marketplace or Kings Shops with more than enough choices of restaurants and even a grocery store. The bedroom was nicely appointed with simple but clean design and the view of the bay was excellent. We left the room early and came home late because the Big Island is an absolute blast! We based out of Hilton Waikoloa Village and traveled north,south and east and west on every road we could find. Tripadvisor kept us enjoying the best of the best restaurants, local shops and activities. I would definitely stay here again! ", " The hotel grounds were beautiful. The breakfast buffet had an incredible selection and the omelets were great. The walk to/from the room was very long but not terrible. The wait times for the tram/boat were long and we rarely used them. The boat was full of high school aged kids a couple of times we tried to use it. The bed was awesome in the king room in the Palace Tower. The room was clean and had plenty of space and a partial ocean view. The Kona Tap Room was great. A good selection of beers and had a great band one night. Also caught part of a hockey game. The Lagoon Grill was okay. The service could have been better. Pools and hot tub were good. You could get close to watch the dolphins without having to do the dolphin experience. The facility is huge. I was worried about it being overly crowded but there was plenty of space. The $27 per day parking fee is a bit extreme. ", " Vacation. Traveled May 2-11th. The hotel grounds where beautiful. The staff was excellent as was the cleanliness of the room. If we were to travel to this island again we would definitely consider your hotel. ", " We recently spent 4 days at the Hilton Waikaloa Village. Much has been written about it, so I thought it might be helpful to point out some highlights and a few things to look out for.First, the property and grounds are expansive and stunning. There is a lot to do, including: pools, dolphin experience, tennis, water sports in the lagoon, morning expercise, yoga, nearby golf, a luau, and onsite restaurants. There are 3 different buildings plus the lobby located around the central lagoon with long covered walkways between them. The walkways are filled with art from Hawaii and a the Pacific rim and worth some time to stop and read the descriptions.I suggest the Lagoon Tower, which is closer to the lobby and near the adult pools, tennis courts, and dolphin experience, and a much shorter walk from the breakfast restaurant and lobby. However, ask for a lagoon side room because the other (south) side overlooks the roof of the spa, so the view is not nearly as good. If you stay on the ground floor, you will be able to go outside through your patio door and sit on the grass by the lagoon. The Ocean Tower is much farther from the lobby. If you get tired of walking around the property, there is also a tram, and a passenger boat in the evenings to ferry you around via an elevated canal system.There is a large breakfast buffet starting at 7am. The Italian restaurant, Dona and Toni's, is located on the boat canal and very good. This is a great spot to watch the runners light the numerous torches that dot the grounds and give the whole property a beautiful glow after sunset. Only disappointment was the more upscale restaurant, which has a beautiful view of the sunset over the ocean, but is very overpriced.We thought that the customer service was very good, with lots of friendly staff, several of which helped us with ideas about where to go during the day. We asked for someone to come check a minor mechanical issue in our room, and he arrived within 10minutes and was very professional.Resort is half hour drive north of the Kona Airport, but in the afternoons during the week, there is some traffic heading south on the main highway. Volcano National Park is a 2.5 hour drive along the northern route through Hilo, and 3 hours taking the road through Kona around the south side of the island. We also visited the Greenwell Coffee Farm, one hour south, which was very interesting.Overall, this is a fabulous place to spend a holiday. I would come back. ", " Loved everything about this place. Breathtaking views, amazing pool with waterfalls and bridge, excellent Italian restaurant. Fun places to relax and enjoy the views. Ice cream shop was nice too. Restaurants are a bit pricy, but that's expected. Art and sculptures all over the grounds. Hammocks close to the ocean to relax and enjoy the weather. Walking paths, tram or ferry to take you wherever you want to go. Rooms are huge. Balcony has great views. Great location. ", " The resort offers plenty of activities for everyone yet you can always find a beautiful little spot to be alone. Waikoloa has made the Big Island my new favorite place to visit. Whether alone, as a couple, or with family this is a great experience. ", " Fantastic time; valet service for car was extremely fast and easy. Enjoyed all the restaurants and food that was offered. Can't say enough about the views-the mountains, water and sunsets. Rooms were nice size. ", " We have stayed in Hilton Waikoloa Village 5 years in a row and each time is just as good as the first. We always stay at the Ocean Tower, with ocean views. We enjoy the quiet spot, where we have coffee in the mornings, read a book in the afternoon or watch the sunset. As the food is quite expensive in the resort, we walk up to Queens Market. We hired a microwave oven (organized it at the front desk) and we found that very handy. We enjoy every holiday here and can't wait to return next year! ", " My other half and I stayed here for 5 nights. We booked through Costco Travel. It was a very nice package, priced perfectly - included 5 nights' accommodations, daily breakfast buffet for the 2 of us, resort fee paid for and a rental car. We arrived late (due to a flight delay), so Front Desk was very quiet when we checked in. They offered us an upgrade from the Ocean Tower to the Palace Tower in a partial ocean view room. Score! Very nice of our check-in guy. We couldn't see our view in the dark of night on our lanai when we got into our room, but in the morning, we saw that this was more than just a partial view room...it was ocean view. Very nice. Everything worked in our room, from TV to the safe deposit box, to the empty fridge (great for the water bottles we were going to buy). Really liked having a plug outlet at our bedside tables, perfect for plugging in our phones.The property is huge. We took long walks around the property and everything was just beautifully taken care of. We ate at the Lagoon Grill (near the lagoon and Dolphin Quest) and the Tap Room (the night-time lounge). Both were good. We had an unfortunate encounter with a sour, rude server at the Lagoon Grill, but the Manager and another server more than made up for that, and were super kind to us. The food was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed eating there for snacks and lunches during our stay. We rented a pedal boat from the lagoon and saw turtles, angel fish, and lots of sea life. The hot tubs were great. We enjoyed pool hopping and spent hours at this resort. It wasn't crowded at this time of year to stay. There was a conference going on in the ballrooms but you barely noticed them at all. It was no problem finding a lounge chair. There were no crowds to get on the water slides. The population was mostly middle-aged couples like us, retirees, and young families with small children. Breakfast at Big Island Buffet was great for a good start to the day. We loved having our spinach/mushroom/tomato egg white omelette and papaya in the morning. There were lots of healthy options there and a lot of fun (not so healthy) treats there too. Something for everyone.Now, the not so good things...Room: I hated the bathroom, so teeny tiny with the bath tub/shower and toilet, and the door just fitted in there so tightly. And I'm not a big person at all, very petite. For a resort and the prices they charge, I think the bathroom should be better, more spa like. I also hated the carpet. We had a room in pretty good condition so we were lucky.Restaurant Choices: There wasn't much choice in restaurants. For dinner, you'd get the super expensive KPC or the really low-grade pizza joint. We liked the Lagoon Grill and enjoyed eating there for lunch and snacks but dinner, we wanted something a bit more in the middle. With Imari and Kirin closed for business, we had to venture offsite to eat. Sensai and Lava Lava Beach Club were excellent and HWV should look into setting up something like those. Self Parking Charge: OK, why is this not included in the resort charge and is an extra charge? TBH, I'm not sure what the resort charge included besides in-room WiFi. There were no daily water bottles. We bought our own. The resort charge should cover useful things, not odds and ends. I can understand valet parking to be extra but self-parking should be included in the resort fee.Overall, we loved this place and look forward to coming back. So massive, so much to do, so many nooks and crannies to explore. Loved the boats and tram. And the Hilton staff looked after us so very well. Thank you to the Hilton for giving us such a wonderful time!!! ", " Our stay on the Big Island could not have been more perfect. The resort has a beautiful setting, fantastic art work at every turn, Lots of water activities including Dolphin pools, outstanding breakfast buffet--I could go on and on. We loved it!! ", " This is by no means your average resort, and you should check if it will suit your needs.Having said that, for us it was a great start to the trip and I was surprised that five nights was not too much. ", " When we arrived to this destination, we were met by a very crowded front office, which is actually outdoors. It was moving along swiftly and staff was quite friendly. This is nestled far away from the airport and thankfully we had a rental car, of which, I highly recommend. This property actually has gondolas that travel a water stream to different sections of the hotel as well as a hotel owned and operated tram. Did I mention this is a HUGE property? The restaurants are all very decently priced and tasty and the hotel was clean and spacious. My room had a beautiful view of the ocean and resort pools. This property actually houses, the Dolphin Quest adventures, and while we didn't purchase the tickets, we could walk down in the mornings and watch the dolphins get fed as well as talk directly to the trainers. Additionally, this property has it's own ocean fed lagoon and that gives the impression of oceans without fear of shark activity. Downside of any resorts, even though you pay resort and parking fee's, activities, cabanas and towels cost extra! ", " I was hesitant going to what was described as a kitchy type mega resort but was pleasantly surprised by it's quality and beauty. My kids are 2 and 4 so the lagoon was perfect. At that age pools are a bit of a bummer because they can't quite swim but they want to be in the water, playing in the sand, so we hit the lagoon almost every day. We stayed in the middle tower looking toward the golf course. It was great, quieter than our first room which was \"ocean view\" if you looked all the way to your right. That room was unfortunately loud because of birds in the atrium so we switched. I had really wanted a 1 bedroom upgrade but at an additional $350/n we said no thanks to it at check in. Luckily our room had a massive closet with no door on it in the bathroom area that worked great as a room for my 2 year old. The designers designed the bathrooms horribly giving them tons of wasted space that could have made the rooms really luxurious but it helped make a nook for my son's pack n play. I uploaded the tower map so you can request a room away from the atrium.The food at the resort is good, not incredible but we had the morning buffet included in our Costco package and that was nice to fill up on, go early because by 9am there will be a bit of a wait. When I was deciding on what area to stay in I read many reviews that complained about the walk. I can assure you that my 2 and 4 year old walked around the resort just fine. It's not a hike, 15-20 minutes one end to the other total and the hallways are like a museum. We loved the walk actually. My only complaint is so staff just seem in their own world. A couple of the boat operator would be texting and the breakfast staff was hustling. The line at check in was oddly long, I'm surprised they haven't streamlined that process a bit. The luau was as cheesy as you'd expect, the one I went to on Maui previously was as well. This one only had maybe 10 cast members so it's small but the storyline was good. Our tickets were included but I wouldn't go out of your way to go especially if tickets are full price. Anyway, over we loved it and would love to go back! ", " Our stay at the Waikoloa was full of memories, beauty, and peace. We will be coming back again soon. The beaches, the pools, the food, the walking the property, and the staff were all just a few of the wonderful things that we enjoyed on our journey ", " Absolutely wonderful property in a perfect location. From start to finish the Hilton Waikoloa Village proves it is the perfect Hawaiian getaway. Our experience began with a warm welcome and service by Noah on the front drive. Followed by a superb checkin experience with Nick welcoming us as loyal Hilton Honors members. He was very attentive and genuine while speaking with us. Joel who was bartending at Kona Tap Room was very helpful in giving us advice of places to visit on the island. Our server Sheryl at Dona & Toni's made our meal a pleasant experience. Can't forget to mention the dinner at KPC is a must. The Hilton Waikoloa Village is truly a spectacular place. The sunsets are something you simply have to see for yourself. Strongly recommend snorkeling in the lagoon as well as attending the Legends of Hawaii Luau. The resort has something for everyone for any reason of being there. Fantastic location that is an easy drive to nearby villages and beaches. Thank you for an experience that we will never forget. ", " We spent a week here and absolutely loved it. There are some decent food options at the resort, the acai bowls were a great way to start our day most days, then just having enough stuff to do we could have stayed the whole time at the resort and had a great time. The hot tubs and pools were fun, lots of places to disappear and read, and the room we had was great as well. You're about 30 minutes to anywhere, so give yourself time if you're running to town for a movie or dinner. Great job to the crew here though, they did good by us ", " Loved this property-kept the kids busy and the adults happy! Amazing pools and the lagoon was very entertaining. Liked that there was food and shopping nearby.The boat and tram made it easy to get around... ", " Hilton Waikoloa is a SPECIAL place. Been here many times and we love it! Always treated like royalty. Thanks to all we have met. We were checked in by Mike - a really nice man and wonderful representative of the Hilton Waikoloa! Thanks Mike. ", " I've never had such an extraordinary experience like spendig four days at this wonderful man-made oasis on Waikoloa, Big Island of Hawaii. Congratulations to Hilton hotels!You get everything you should need in the most perfect beach resort of Hawaii. ", " We stayed in an other Hilton property close by, so can't comment on the accommodation/rooms. We went with two small kids, and tried all the pools, slides. They loved the tram and boat rides. The views and landscaping are amazing. The lagoon and the seaside walk is really picturesque. You can stop and watch the dolphins from Dolphin Quest. There are also flamingos and nenes a bit more up, As well as great exhibits art, local artifacts on the corridors. ", " Honestly I can't find anything bad to say about this resort. Wait...there is one thing; the exit gate at the parking lot malfunctioned. That's it. Incredible property, much larger than anticipated. We stayed at Kings Land which gave us access to the Hilton Village so I can't comment on the rooms but everything thing else is first rate. Had a wonderful seaside massage one day. This is a FANTASTIC resort...great location...I could go on and on but just put this one on top of your list. ", " I like to read reviews before I go on a trip, so I was 50/50 on this one. However this hotel exceeded all standards and my family had an incredible vacation in paradise. Outstanding we loved the Makai experience, you gotta go!We had a rental car but only left the resort on the last day. They even have shuttles that take you locally if you don't want the expense of a car.My 8 year old loved all the pools and they were the perfect depth 3ft 9\"- 4ft-12\" or even less for the tiny ones. Floaties and rings are even allowed. They have everything from dolphins to snorkeling , kayaking, water slides, Jacuzzi., waterfalls and so much more to list.We did the Makai experience which was well worth it , however if you do want to spend less it's also well worth it because there are trams and canal boats and beautiful walks to get you to the Lagoon tower where most of the activity is . They are leisurely and cool with air conditioning on hot days and often a great way to rest your feet from all the exploring you will want to do. We did swim with the dolphins however people can still relax and view the experience on the beach without that expense. So don't pass up the experience over cost. Yes food is pricey however their is a grocery store down the road where you can even get a big hot Rotisserie chicken to share for a spectacular sunset picnic. Staff were so helpful and extremely hard working. Extremely clean , breakfast has an abundance of fresh and local foods including omelet station and tonnes of tasty treats for kids. The all you can eat Nutella bowl was a hit for my little one. The only thing the rooms can do with is a retractable clothes line in the shower to hang all the wet swim wear on, that would be a handy feature. Other than that , you will want for nothing here. Hilton Waikoloa Village has something for everyone. Do not pass up any deals they have , we went through Cost Co and booked early. Thank you to all the staff for making Spring Break a memorable experience. We cannot wait to return. ", " The Hiton is a dream place for families, but also suitable for couple. You cannot beat the walk along the coastline, the tropical/turtle filled lagoon and beautiful pool. Great value too for the Kohala Coast and located in a resort area full of amenities! ", " We've stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for five out of the past six years and enjoy our time there. The price of the rooms have definitely gone up over the years, but the prices of everything in Hawaii have also gone up during that time. The first couple of years we stayed at the Palace Tower and Ocean Tower but the past few, we've paid a little more to stay at the Lagoon Tower, since it's closer to the lobby, the larger pool, and lagoon, where we like to kayak around. We have breakfast at least once at the Big Island Breakfast buffet, lunch at the Lagoon Grill, and usually a light dinner at what used to be the Malolo Lounge but is now the Kona Tap Room. For other meals, we'll eat breakfast in our room, and also dinner at Romano's and Roy's. We enjoy the water slide and pool, and walking around the property. You can definitely get exercise just from walking the large property. The staff are all friendly and the rooms are clean and spacious. The mountain view rooms at the Lagoon Tower have a nice view of Mauna Kea and some rooms even have a partial ocean view. We'll definitely be back! ", " Was at Waikoloa in April 1989. Returned April 2017. Resort just as beautiful as first visit. Well maintained. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Only suggestion would be to have some sort of activities for teens. Highly recommend this resort ", " Very nice hotel to stay in. Very clean , staff friendly and kind. Easy to get around, plenty to do right on the grounds. Family oriented for any ages, many pools never feels crowed plenty of elbow room, has a tram and a boat to move you around or you can simply walk. ", " We traveled to the Hilton Waikoloa Village in the beginning of March and had a great time. The property is grand and quite spread out but the amenities that are available to guests are great. We appreciated the different pools and the calm lagoon to snorkel in. It was always a fun place to return to after an exciting day exploring the island. We were staying in the Ocean Tower which is the farthest tower away from the main lobby and parking lot. Our room was clean and comfortable but towards the end of our stay, the trek to and from our room was a bit tedious. The trams and boat service helped that though! All in all, we had a great stay and look forward to returning to Kona in the near future! ", " This hotel has everything you could ever imagine for all members of your family during your stay. From checking in until checking out, all of your needs are met by an excellently trained staff. The hotel and its grounds are fabulous! ", " We loved staying at Makai side, easy access to the lagoon, pool, shops and restaurant. Transportation was on time. no need to go anywhere else if you stay at Makai, you have the Lagoon 2 min walk to amazing snorkle experience, padle board, kyak, waterbikes and more, beautiful pool with slides and waterfall just down the elevator, specially reserved beach chair for Makai guests. Dolphin encounter right next to the pool, restaurant and shops and spa right outside the elevator. My kids had a great time. ", " When my kids walked in the lobby, their jaws dropped to the floor. It was like Disneyland with the monorail in the lobby. The lagoon was amazing with all the sea life and water sports. The dolphins could have entertained my kids all day. It was truly an amazing resort! ", " The room was great! The entire staff was friendly and accommodating. I wish we would have stayed longer to enjoy all this resort has to offer. We didn't use the boats to get around but the train was a great way to get around. Walking around was great too as there was so much to see. The only caution I would have is just that this is a resort, it's not Hawaii. Be sure to get out to see the island, too! ", " The property is massive! There are two 4 car trains shuttling people back and forth from one end of the property to the other. And occasional boats that do the same. Swim areas that are part of the ocean - yeah - with sea turtles cruising on by, and lots of fish. Sunset is a moment to gather on the beach and ohh and ahh. KPC restaurant is SUPERB! ", " We really enjoyed the Hilton on the Big Island & feel we had a wonderful experience! I enjoyed the Hawaiian classes that were offered complimentary! The spa was also a fun experience! I only took one exercise class but found it very Good! The food is expensive but did find a nice variety! It is helpful to have a refrigerator &'coffee pot! We are older so did wish for more shady locations to sit during the day! Even at the adult pool we spent the day moving our chair seeking shade! ", " Beautiful pools! Loved the comfy bed. Italian restaurant was first rate. I recommend this resort and think everyone should experience this level of quality at least once in their travel life. Day trips to surrounding areas easy to get to as well. ", " We stayed at this resort for one night. It is an absolutely beautiful resort. There is a wonderful lagoon connected to the ocean that you can snorkel in; you can also rent canoes, body boards, etc to use in here. There were a number of pools some of them with slides and waterfalls that my son really enjoyed. Rooms were very nice and beautifully appointed. We had an issue where I scheduled the luau on the wrong night (the night before we arrived); the Hilton staff was great about this and graciously refunded our money despite the error being my fault. Excellent service throughout. We really enjoyed our time here and would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves on the Big Island. ", " Located in Waikoloa, this place is away from the commercialization of most of Hawaii. Very beautiful pools and not very crowded compare to many of the resorts in Honolulu or Maui. Service was prompt and gracious. We got an upgraded ocean view room in the palace building. The room was large and comfortable. Recently updated. We only ate on the grounds once in the Italian restaurant. It was good and relatively cheap. Our kids love the multiple pools but they love the lagoon with the water activities.The property is large and spread out over multiple buildings. ", " We were very impressed with the Hilton Waikoloa during our stay. Our first impression was a little bumpy with very slow check in and very slow and unresponsive service by housekeeping after we got to the room to find that the two queen beds in our room only had two pillows on each one. But after those few speed bumps the resort, the food and the scenery were fantastic. If your eating breakfast in the morning, got to Big Island Breakfast buffet and ask for David. He's a great guy, with funny stories, excellent with the kids and has good tips for things to do in Hawaii.One thing I beg Hilton to improve are their pillows. I stay in so many hotels for business and for pleasure and Hilton has by far the worst pillows in the industry. They are extremely flat and provide no support whatsoever. You have to fix this Hilton....please!!! ", " a most beatiful hotel the best w\"ve stayed at . so much to see and do , actually # 1 place for us so far, plan on going back next year, ths luau was amazing ,food really good . sunset was very beatuifull to see for my wife and I, went out every night we stayed there.. thanks Hilton, S ", " Just spent a week at The Hilton Waikoloa Village and absolutely fell in love with everything about it. We stayed in the Makai tower overlooking the lagoon, dolphins and the ocean. The view was spectacular in every direction. This place has just about everything you could ask for (except mini golf). The sunsets were amazing and there are so many good spots to view them. It truly is set up well to watch sunsets. The pools were great and not to busy during the week at all. When we were leaving a triathlon was taking place the next day so it was getting a little too busy for what I'd like. There is no beach other than the lagoon but if you walk for 15 mins from the makai tower there is a beach that had beach loungers out for the public and sports equipment for rentals. Turtles were sunning themselves on this beach and it was not to busy there. We really only ate breakfast at the resort so I'm not sure how the restaurants are but the breakfast buffet was great but pricey for the full deal. Actually we found everything pricey but we expected this before going. The room was great with a nice comfy bed and pillows. I did find I wasn't able to adjust the air conditioner as low as I'd have liked at night so I was a bit warm. Big rooms though with double sinks in the bathroom. Staff were great. It was a little slow in the Hilton honors line the day we were checking out. There was only one person working that counter and on such a busy weekend with the triathlon I would have expected more staff working. But not a big deal as we expected delays with so much people arriving. All in all, an amazing resort that I would highly recommend to anything thinking of visiting the Big Island.Looking forward to another visit one day hopefully! ", " This was our second visit to Hilton Waikoloa Village. The resort is beautiful and well maintained. Customer service was excellent at this resort from the valet, front desk, housekeeping to all of the managers who we had the pleasure of meeting. We stayed eight nights in the Makai Tower and Naupaka Suite. We would recommend this resort and will return in the future. ", " We didn't stay here but came to check it out. Awesome lagoon for kids to swim safely and for people to try ocean activities if they're nervous of the sea. It's connected to the ocean, so various fish come in the lagoon. A turtle was swimming around there too. There's a pool with dolphins who can't come and go. That's sad but fascinating to see up close nonetheless. The halls are like museums and art galleries- many interesting things from the South Pacific. For day parking, there's a small free lot on the right just before the pay lots on your left. ", " This hotel is marvelous and huge. It has lots of things to do and offer variety of swim pools for all ages. Since they are on back waters, you can kayak, snorkel, or maybe just hangout. They have maintained the marine life and you may see exotic sea animals occasionally. They have dolphin shows too.There are running trails, walking zones and cool little parks with beautiful trees all around. This is an apt place if you are looking for a calm yet adventurous trip.Oh ! and don't forget to try the good exotic sea food. ", " Because my husband and I feel like we're coming back \"home\" when we stay at this Hilton,we've stayed here at least three or four times! Everything is exciting and excellent! Can hardly wait until we vacation here next year! ", " We went to the big island of Hawaii and stayed at Hilton Waikoloa Village and had a fantastic time. The sprawling resort is absolutely gorgeous. My grandson got to swim with the dolphins and he will never forget the experience. It was a thrill for us to watch him knowing how much he was loving being able to touch and kiss the dolphin. It was pricy but it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for him so it was worth it. ", " Beautiful resort with lots of activities for children and adults. Thoroughly enjoyed snorkeling in the lagoon without the waves. The adult pool was excellent however, a few umbrellas would help to protect you from the sun. We stayed in Ocean Towers. The rooms were not very clean. You could see the dirt and dust in the desk and behind the bed. Overall I enjoyed my stay but they could improve on housekeeping services. One evening I called for towels and after 30 minutes no one picked up the phone. I finally called the front desk and towels were delivered. ", " It was lovely just wished we had internet service ! We loved the different ways to get to our room. The cantina was definitely our favorite to sit and relax at. The pool bartenders were awesome when they closed the pool for an accident he was sure to make us a cocktail to accommodate us. The towels ran out fast so we had to makes sure we got them in time in the morning. The staff all was friendly. Checking in was great we ran into a few issues with check out because the staff was over whelmed. The pools were nice and very family friendly. We will and want to bring the kids back for another fun vacation. ", " I visited this resort on a school trip and I stayed here with my friends and some teachers. This was by far the best resort I've stayed at! First of all, the resort has lots of food and shopping options especially if you walk or take the trolley to the marketplace. The rooms were wonderful! The pool was great for everyone; kids, adults, families, etc. and there is so many other things to do here as well. There is swimming with the Dolphins, snorkeling in the lagoon, a water slide, a golf course, and so much more! To top it all off it is a very large resort that's in a beautiful location. I couldn't be happier I stayed here! It was the experience of a lifetime! ", " This resort was so nice and there was so much to do without even having to get in your car. We loved the ocean fed lagoon to go snorkeling and paddle boarding. My kids saw some sea turtles in the lagoon! ", " My fiance and I spent a week at this awesome week at this wonderful resort! It truly has something for everyone. We highly recommend a sunset dinner at Kameula Provisions! have drinks at any one of many pool side bars, swim with the dolphins or get your own private bungalow. Aloha ", " The pool gets its water from the ocean. So, a giant sea turtle was able to get into the pool, and we were lucky enough to see it. What an amazing place!!! Too bad I wasn't in the water at that exact time. It was near the man-made fountain in the \"pool\".The hotel is amazing. We didn't stay here. We only visited for the Dolphin Quest experience. They also have a \"train\" to take you to your hotel room, which my kids enjoyed riding. ", " Pros- Clean and great customer service. Everything you need is on or very close to the resort.Cons- No beach (has lagoon), food is expensive.Overall, we had a great experience. Great beaches nearby! ", " Wonderful hotel and friendly, helpful staff. Huge grounds where you can find so many things to do even without leaving the property. As with most of Hawaii, things are expensive here but that was as expected. ", " We stayed a week, and found little to criticize unless you expect resorts in prime locations like this to be inexpensive. Yes, parking is a hike, but part of the experience here is not having cars littered everywhere. There is a train and there are boats that take you from anyplace in the resort if walking is a problem. Their breakfast is excellent, and they are well organized around getting large numbers of people to tables. The Lagoon Grill has limited offerings but we found the food good enough that we never left the beach for lunch. We generally went off site for dinner, but the Kamelua Provision Company should be on your list for at least one night. Their food is first rate and paying to secure a spot on the lanai to watch the sunset and hear the surf is worth it (they also give you sparkling wine as part of their premium). ", " Had two rooms in the ocean tower, however, that part of the resort is now being converted to timeshares. If we return, we will get a room in the lagoon tower, facing the ocean. Rooms were very nice and Service staff was excellent. We really enjoyed the luau, especially the dancers. Breakfast was overpriced and food was so-so. You can order ala cart, but it adds up to almost the same as the $32.50 buffet . Overall would definitely recommend this resort for travelers of all kinds. Lots of different swimming pools to choose from. Beautiful landscaping. ", " I think for some reason I have reviewed as Wiakoloa Beach Resort as it does show pictures of the Hilton property. This is where I've stayed both trips. First in the Ocean Tower, then the Palace Tower this past trip. Again the best HGV Concierge staff at the property was still there. Altanta Mike, Cindy, and Jerry will book any tour for you. The nicest place to stay on the Big Island. Again, refer to my Waikoloa Beach Resorts reviews which both reflect all of the Hilton Wiakoloa Village property..........The big purple slide is the best and so is the pool bar with Timmy as your bartender. All staff was great, maids, pool attendants\u200b, front desk clerk who helped me decide to upgrade to the newly renovated Palace Tower. Only place I'd stay. I don't know if the other one I reviewed is affiliated with Hilton, but this is where I stayed both trips, NOT Wiakoloa Beach Resort. Unknowingly did not mean to mislead anyone reading my reviews. Pictures showed Hilton Wiakoloa Village property layout photos.......Stay at the Hilton Wiakoloa Village, you won't be disappointed!!!!!! ", " We spent a nice long afternoon and evening before our very late flight home. Yes, it's a bit of a splurge to do so, but where else can you go for a swim, some sun, a delicious meal, watch the dolphins, and join everyone for that last Hawaiian sunset.We got a view of the island and the water from the lanai as a bonus when we booked a basic room. The room is clean, furnished real nice, and enabled us to get ready for trip home. ", " I stayed here 25 years ago. I have told stories to my son about this place as long as I can remember. We brought him here last week for his high school graduation gift and it did not disappoint! Everyone was incredibly helpful as soon as we walked in the resort. We had an ocean view room with an amazing view! My son said that he's coming here when he has kids! Resort is as beautiful as ever! ", " We have stayed at hotels all over the world and mostly very nice. But this one has shown us the gold standard. Now let's not talk about hotel rooms or typical service as that is comparable to other Hilton's, Westins, etc. But the setting and physical hotel grounds are unmatched anywhere we visited. There shark ponds, dolphin ponds, waterfalls, turtle ponds, man-made lakes, water slides, on-site monorail, boat service between the hotel buildings, etc. You get the idea. Food is good at the various restaurants. ", " I am pretty picky when it comes to resorts/travel (read my other reviews!), and I was a little nervous booking this resort because of some of the reviews I had read. But, I was wrong about those nerves! When we arrived, they had told me our building had been remodeled recently (yay!), Lagoon tower, and that their Ocean tower is up next for remodel in May. Once they complete that, this place will be perfect! They upgraded us to an ocean/lagoon view, and it was amazing!! The room is huge, the balcony was really private, and everything was fresh and new. We were a little bit nervous about the tram and boat at the resort, thinking this place might be too big for us, but we found that we really enjoyed walking around this beautiful resort and didn't use those (I don't think they are overly necessary). Walking around is really not a big deal. I have been to much worse and this place is at least very, very beautiful! There are always pros and cons to every resort:Pros:Pool areas are amazing!Beds are comfortableRooms are large and comfortableStaff is super friendly, plus they leave you alone if you wantThe resort is very beautiful. It was nice taking walks around the resort.We had free breakfast included in our package, and it was a wonderful buffet!Didn't seem overly crowded, and I was always able to get a chair at the pool every day easily.It seemed like a really good deal, our package through our travel agency included the breakfast and a full size car, which worked out perfectly.They had plenty to do if you wanted, dolphins swims, kayaks, paddle boarding, swimming, etc. We didn't take advantage of all of these things, but it was nice to know we would never be bored!Cons:Parking of course! We did the self park, and I am glad we did. The walk really isn't that far and you don't have to wait in line for your car, but one night it was very hard to find a spot to park because the parking is for local events as well, and Saturday they had one. Plus the $27 a day is a bit steep ($35 for valet!).The food at the hotel was too expensive for our cheap taste! We just went down the road to the food court several times (Subway, Dairy Queen and some local fish fast food places). We also went to the store and they sell sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, etc.We don't drink alcohol, but if you are expecting pool service, it seemed non existent. There is a bar near the pool area, but there is no one walking around taking orders for you.It seems like the pool areas don't keep locals or other hotel guests out, especially at night. There were a bunch of what seemed local kids down at the pools and hot tubs each night we were there, and there is no gate to keep anyone out if they wanted to. No beach at this resort, but you could walk down the road (or drive) to a nearby beach, but it's not a very pretty one. I recommend a 7 min drive up north to Hapuna beach (white sand, just beautiful!). All in all, we really had a great time and this is one of the few resorts I can say that I will probably go back to!  ", " I have to do a review of this resort, even though it was about five months ago that we were here! This is a spectacular resort, with so much to do, for adults and kids alike! We went with our extended family - kids ranging from 3-8 years of age, parents, and grandparents. The hotel itself is beautiful, rooms are clean and big, although the bathroom was disappointingly small and dark. However, we spent very little time in there, so it didn't matter! The resort has several swimming pools, some with water slides, which the kids loved! The lagoon in the middle of the resort is lovely, and you can go snorkeling there. If you want to go proper snorkeling, you have to go outside the resort, but the lagoon is perfect for the kids to practise. I didn't think love the small space for the dolphins held captive at the resort, but others seemed to like swimming with them. The lu'au was something special (if a little cheesy!). The resort has many different types of restaurants and cuisines. Food is expensive but good quality. Outside the resort, we went on a volcano tour and snorkeling. Lots of things to do on the island if you can pull yourself away from the resort!All in all, we had a wonderful 5 days at this resort. My kids still talk about this place, and wish we could go back! ", " This was an excellent location with many many choices of activities. The food was excellent again with a wide variety of choices. The views were breath taking from every direction. Rooms were extremely clean and service was excellent! ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Ocean Tower w/Ocean View late August-early September 2016. Used convenient self-parking for our rental car. Short walk to Lobby for check-in. Quick check in; however, big DISAPPOINTMENT that even though the resort was not full, we were not offered an upgrade for our Hilton member status! Room needed updating, but it was spacious, comfortable, and clean! Enjoyed sunsets from our balcony!Big Island Breakfast buffet was delicious. Thank you Dave for your humorous, knowledgeable, patient service! We made sure to be in the dining room by 7 each morning to avoid the crowds! Also ate at least once at the Boat Landing Cantina, Lagoon Grill, Kona Tap Room, Orchid Marketplace, and Dona & Tony's Pizza. Service in ALL the restaurants was excellent! Food was fresh and tasted delicious! We saw the what other guests were eating before ordering. Portions were large, so my husband and I shared one order. Bartenders in both the Kona Tap Room and D & T Pizza were very personable and helpful taking our order, even making a special drink to substitute for a drink that wasn't available. Orchid Marketplace by Kona Pool has prepared/ prepackaged food but also took personal orders for the grill. We did eat off property each day during our adventures around the island and found most prices just as expensive as the hotel on the Kona side of the island. Hilo side was less expensive.Tried the Kona, Kohala, Ocean Tower pools and the Beach Lagoon-Beach Lagoon was our favorite! Brought our own snorkel gear to snorkel each morning for an hour in the lagoon with fish, sea turtles, and eels! Also enjoyed a leisurely stroll each morning along all the paths and walkways around the perimeter of the property starting/ending at Buddha Point! Not the one morning when Hurricane Madeline sent in rain, strong winds, and overcast sky! Lastly, our stay was 10 days, so I appreciated the use of the launderette on the 1st floor of the Ocean Tower right inside the entrance/exit to the Kohala Pool!Plan to return with our grandchildren next year! ", " We had a fantastic time staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The grounds are spectacular and well-maintained. The staff made us feel welcome and did a tremendous job. Special shout-out to the staff at Dona and Tonis' Pizza-- Their food was wonderful, the restaurant is a great place to eat, and the staff was marvelous! ", " Enjoying our stay at one of the most beautiful resorts I have been to. We have stayed at hotel and condos. This is a great family place. Pools are not crowded. The resort has shopping beaches and restaurants. Water sports and snorkeling. ", " Using Hilton Honors Points, we enjoyed 4 nights on the property. It was nice to have the pick of three pools and a good variety of restaurants. The bellman was superb - getting our bags to our room even before we arrived. We enjoyed dinner on the \"point,\" enjoying the evening's sunset - as well as food in the \"Tap\" bar, where we found the food great and reasonably priced. We had a 6th floor room with a Lanai, overlooking the ocean - so we enjoyed sunsets from our balcony as well. As a Diamond member, we enjoyed a hearty breakfast for $10 each. If we wanted the Continental breakfast, it would have been free. Some folks complained about the largeness of the property - however we didn't mind the extra walking for the exercise - and we enjoyed the boat transport, as well as the tram. We would visit the property again. ", " My wife & I stayed a week at Waikoloa Village, and want to go back!The resort is well laid out and bigger than you think. The best part is the lagoon.We opted for the Makai experience in the Lagoon tower, mainly because that's the view we wanted. I can't say it worth the extra price for the service, but the room was very nice.Note that while there are several restaurants on the property, there's only one place for a full breakfast - the Big Island Breakfast Buffet. The price per adult was $32. So breakfast alone can add up to a big tab at the end of the week. My wife is gluten intolerant, and she was able to find enough food in the buffet to her liking. She absolutely loved the gluten free pizza at Dona & Toni's, so we ate there for dinner twice.Most of the time you will opt for the tram to get around, as the boats don't run all day.We had dinner a couple of times at the boat landing cantina. I mention this because at dusk the noise from the local birds is very loud. I don't know how what the noise level is in the Ocean Tower rooms at that time or if this happens ad dawn.There are a few restaurants in the nearby shops (including one that serves breakfast). There is a shuttle to the shops if you don't have a car. It's a bit of a walk, especially if it's hot.Plan on spending time at the lagoon. If you want to snorkel, rent equipment at the shops instead of at the lagoon. It's much cheaper for a whole week.If you have a car, make a side trip up to beach 69. Ask a local about it.Enjoy ", " We stayed in a Makai room in the Lagoon tower with mountain views but also partial ocean views. If you want a modern room then you really need to upgrade to the Makai room. The pools are fantastic for the adults and kids, and the sunset viewing is a must. We ate at the Lagoon Grill twice, but I recommend utilising the restaurants at the Kings shops or Queens Marketplace, which are only a short shuttle trip away. Overall this resort is massive, but utilise the trams (monorail) and boats to get you around. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Kona Hotel (Dec 2016)*Service and Staff: Extremely friendly, customer oriented and everyone is just happy! There is a train and boat on property\u2026because it is that big. The beaches are not the Gulf Coast, West Coast, or even typical Hawaiian beaches you probably are expecting. Google Kona beaches a little. There are black sand beaches and there are a lot of rocks. However, the property has beach access with stunning views and plenty of lagoon and pool activities to keep you wet. *Room: Very nice. Modern and contemporary with plenty of space. We had a king bed, pull out sofa and a little round table that did not make the room feel cramped at all. A/C was strong and sufficient. \u00a0*Bed: Pretty much a standard Hilton bed with medium firmness. The comforter was a little on the light side, but totally fine. *Bathroom: Spacious. Modern, clean*Dining: The property is huge. You could easily spend a week just exploring it from one end to another. The dining is what you would expect from a Hilton resort. Yummy and a bit expensive! *Location: Due to the size and all-encompassing amenities, the location with respect to other things is kind of moot. The location with respect to the views, weather, and\u2026well\u2026you\u2019re at a resort in Hawaii. Questions? *Recommend restaurant /bar/ site: Hit them all! There is a place up north a little called Lava Lava that is reported to have great happy hours!  ", " We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Hilton Waikoloa Village. We've been twice. The hospitality is up there with the best. Always something to do on the premises, BUT, there is a beautiful golf course on the right as you pull in and a HUGE shopping mall on the right also. So, with all that, if you can't find something to do then take a nap. My wife and I love the sunsets on our balconies. The food was fabulous! The shops were super. The dolphin training and reserve was where my wife stayed the most. There is so much walking on the hotel premises to experience all the hotel activities that it made it feel the hotel was at least 25 miles long and wide. I rented a wheelchair for my wife. It was the company's annual convention that brought us back to the Islands and it was so very special. Oh BTW, bring your binoculars to watch whales in February & March and then again late summer(?). My wife is only certain of March. ", " My husband and I LOVE this property. I've been coming here since I was a little girl with my family during the summer. This is where my husband proposed to me, and a year later where we celebrated our \"mini moon.\" So this property holds a special place in my heart! We typically go in October through Costco since that is really the only time off we can get, and it's off season, so not too crowded. The last two years, Costco has had an all inclusive deal (hotel room, breakfast buffet, 3 course dinner at any of the restaurants, and all drinks!). So if you work full time and need a break from life like my husband and myself, this is the deal/place for you! Everything is taken care of...no cooking for a whole week! The last two visits, we've stayed in the Makai Tower (the remodeled tower). Yes, some parts of the hotel are not renovated, but they are not bad looking! Just not as modern as other parts of the hotel. The hotel overall is very family friendly, but there is a section of the pool area that is for adults only. We typically have dinner at Kamuela Provision Company, we love everything on the menu. In addition, we love the staff at Waikoloa. Every time we come back, staff welcomes us with open arms, esp. our favorite bartender, Timmy at the pool bar and Esther at breakfast! We can't wait to come back here with our own kids one day. ", " This is a great property; this was my 3rd stay, and my boyfriends' first. It's an exquisite resort. What I really appreciate is the mini-fridge. You can eat there if you want, or you can have your own food. I usually resent being held hostage at resorts to eat their pricey food; Hilton Waikaloa's fridge is a thoughtful and considerate touch. Pay the daily fee for Valet Parking, and call to request your car 20-30 minutes before leaving your room! ", " Upon first arriving it can be overwhelming because it is a rather larger resort, but after the first day you can navigate around fairly well. After turning into Hilton Wiakoloa Village to the left, make the immediate right hand turn up the hill to the main entrance to check in and unload. If you get confused or lost, just call the main desk and they will guide you. We pulled into the $27 parking lot by mistake and got lost...I called the main desk and they voided parking fee and were very kind to guide us to do the right thing. I recommend Valet parking at $32 per day because it cost only $5 more per day and is worry-free. Our 8 day resort fees, and valet with ice cream plus some food charges to our room ran about $600 extra. Walmart in Kona for refridge supplies, drinks etc helped save money. Have valet carry all luggage to your room as well as snacks upon first arrival....small tip $5-$10 ok. Monorail to pools and to each end of resort is helpful and free (as is the boat rides, although much slower). Pool complex is VERY NICE THROUGHOUT! EVERYONE AT THE RESORT WAS VERY POLITE!!!! Dont believe the negative remarks on most reviews because some travelers have a chip on their shoulders because of the long flight...and some folks are \"too big for their own britches\" as the saying goes! If you have a need, ask concierge. Concierge actually helped us with our MARRIOTT LUAU which is Hiltons competitor because we asked and needed help! We will go to this resort again! Great family-friendly place for kids and newlyweds! Not a party-crazy place. Folks behaved, things quietened down after dark,and beautiful torches light the evening paths along the crashing waves. We left the resort each day to explore the Volcanoes and waterfalls, but they are about 2 hrs on the other side of the island. Volcano (township) has a great hamburger joint called Lava Cafe....Outback is 20 minutes away in Kona, McD's also. Blue Hawaiian helicopters best and cheaper from Hilo for lava veiws. Whale watching is GOOD from hotel with binoculars....dont waste money on a cruise. So, theres my 2 cents....a place worth your while! ", " Amazing views! Great Artwork and the Luau is a must do. Ocean Front room in Ocean Tower and the view and the room were amazing. Enjoy lunch and watch Dolphins swim. Multiple pools to choose from. The Tram is nice but if you want to see all the beauty this resort has to offer you need to walk it and explore. ", " We have been at Hilton Waikoloa for a week now. We came for a business conference about 16 years ago, and the facilities were memorable then as they still are now. A little history on this project... back in the days of Japanese investment in Stateside properties, Hyatt and Japanese investors got together and carved out this stunning resort area from barren volcanic rock. The cost in 80s money was nearly 500 million dollars. After the Japanese economy tumbled, the property was sold to Hilton for around 60 million. Now, the property is quietly changing ownership again with future plans to convert some aspects of the hotel to permanent guest ownership. From what I understand- the Hilton name stays... at least for now.The property is \"over the top\" in every conceivable way. Landscaping is lush and well kept on acres of surf crashing rocky beach facing an incredible sunset vista every evening. The rooms are designed for long, comfortable stays. We stayed in the Makai section, an upgrade to a corner room facing the ocean and overlooking the gravel pool. Our room has a private balcony designed to see the view... not to be seen by one's neighbors.Common areas here are extensive. There is a tram that runs through the length of the property, as well as occasional boats running from one tower area to another. We have a six drawer dresser... double sink bathroom, two double drawer nightstands, great wifi, tub with a faucet (that's a joke referring to another review). Doors are solid and work well with a slide in key for the main entry. Pools, lagoons and saltwater areas abound. There is wildlife on property as well as the dolphin swim area. High end shops... well, I could write a book but I won't.We valet parked. It would have been a hassle not to. We stocked up on sundries and snacks at the local Queen's Market, but still enjoyed the onside restaurants and bars. There is a cute trolley shopping shuttle to the markets for $2. Played pool and sang karaoke last night. If you want to do most anything, you can do it here- including booking excursions. The employees here were all friendly, from breakfast staff to housekeeping. Wonderfully trained staff!Just a note about the art- The walking gallery and grounds are filled with treasures, including bronzes of monumental sizes. The architecture of the lagoon landings would have made the original Atlantis proud.If there were any negatives, one would be the breakfast rush in the morning. Long lines to be seated at peak times. See hint below the review. As for poolside lounges, some pool seats are reserved for the Makai guests. Other seats are open. There is a rental fee for cabana style loungers. The dolphin swim is pretty expensive and we passed on it because we have done it before. There are a lot of \"optional\" fees but I don't see that in a poor light as the property needs to generate income to remain as beautiful as it is.You really can stay on this property and have a great vacation, especially with kids. ", " Every morning I enjoyed getting up early and just strolling the grounds. The different Asian art is very impressive. Lots of exotic birds all over the place. Great place for lovers, families, and anyone in general. ", " we actually stayed at the kings land vacation club, but used the pools here everyday.First morning we went opur to the beach and we saw whales and sea turtles. loved the walking paths and the pools. we had breakfast buffet, expensive and only went once. good food buit felt like we payed too much. we ate at market place near by and the tropics ale house after that.Lagoon tower was our favorite for the water activities. ", " Very nice hotel, views are amazing and the lagoon with the Dolphins is a unique feature. Food was good but as everything in Hawaii overpriced. Very helpful staff. Be ready to walk lots as this is a really big property, they do have a train and boats that can help but if you are not in the mood to walk, perhaps not the right hotel for you. Different pools to enjoy, the one I sun tan at also had a slide and had a fee children playing but I found it nice and quiet. ", " We stayed 1 week here. The hotel was gorgeous. We loved snorkeling in the lagoon with the tropical fish and turtles. The dolphins were fun to watch as we ate lunch at the little grill overlooking the pool where you could swim with them. There was a charge for this however. Many pools and restaurants to choose from. We only wish the walls weren't so thin in the guest's rooms. You could hear a lot if what was going on outside your room. The hotel is clean and the grounds are well kept. We could see whales right out in front of the hotel. ", " After reading reviews before our arrival, my expectations were of a crowded Disney-like establishment. It is far and above better. I understand that summers are busier, but mid-February was quite reasonable. The vistas are truly beautiful; the Asian artwork is genuine and exquisite. The complex is very well designed for all ages and the conference areas do not mix with the tourists. Snorkeling in the lagoon offers views of tropical fish and large sea turtles. A variety of restaurant choices provides options from bar food to fine dining. Off-site options abound and the concierge was helpful. Car rentals and shuttle service are on-site. The costs do add up as it's so easy to just list your room number and sign. The spa massage with Nancy was a treat - she's clearly a professional, although expect to pay resort prices. You can walk the entire complex in 10-15 minutes but the trams are free and reliable. The boats are a treat but their hours are not as frequent. Their luau was a great evening of food and entertainment. There are kids pools and adults only pools in addition to the grotto/slides/and lagoon pools. The adult pool was highly sedate - guess we get boring as we age! The dolphins were a hit with our grandson. I appreciated how they work with marine conservationists. The 'swim with the dolphins' package seemed overpriced to me but we all have different passions. My daughter and her husband decided on a late evening drink/dessert at KPC and were thrilled. We all Loved it ! ", " We loved our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! It was perfect for an \"all-inclusive\" resort, especially with kids. The property is beautiful (over 1800 pieces of art in a gorgeous setting on the ocean), the dolphins spectacular and the pools, the beach lagoon and rooms are so nicely maintained. ", " The Hilton has fairly good rooms with views of ocean, lava coastline, pools, and indoor and outdoor art work, particularly statuary everywhere. All of the services are very high quality, the staff are invariably polite and helpful at all levels, and it would be nice if more people tipped them adequately for services rendered; Hawaii is a very expensive place to live, not just to visit. But, whatever you do, unless you absolutely cannot dine off the resort property, do not eat at the two outdoor grills, one called a Cantina, and the other adjacent to the dolphin center. The Cantina, for example, misadvertises its food as steak when it is really a form of kibbled meat; its quacamole, prepared \"table side\", really is deliveredas some kind of avocado mash. The other serves its meals very quickly, but cold. Cold pulled meat on a cold bun is not a way to and an evening after playing with volcanoes. Many diners around us had to send their food back as misordered or otherwise unacceptable. Hilton wants its clients to return, and they should, but only if Hilton extends its quality assurance to these food services. ", " The Waikoloa Resort was our first experience at a resort. The Waikoloa was very nice with a very good location. Many amenities and activities for everyone. The facilities were very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend. ", " First of all; thank you Nicholas (or Nick - depending on which badge he is wearing) for the up-grade. We were on the 7th floor of Palace Tower, with an ocean view; and enjoyed a sunset from our balcony almost every night. The resort is huge; which has pros and cons. There are many options; but if one has limited mobility, getting around is sometimes a challenge. There are trams (or more often a tram--as most days we were there one was not working) that run the length of most of the property. If one is in no hurry, these are a nice option; as are the boats (which are pleasant to ride within, in of themselves).If one is in a hurry, though, walking is really ones only choice. And, if one has trouble walking, there lies the issue. A walk between areas, though long, is beautiful. Besides manicured landscape, the covered walkways house almost museum quality artwork of various medium; worth at least one leisurely stroll to view.There are numerous sculptures and other artwork throughout the grounds; with a life-size oriental war chariot, drawn by 6 horses, which is astounding. The food is pricey but there are many options, with various ranges of price, from which to choose. The breakfast buffet can be crowded, but they do a pretty good job of keeping things flowing; and there is quite a few items from which to choose. For only $2, one can catch a shuttle to the nearby King and/or Queen shops, which provide further dining (as well as shopping), options. Swimming, hiking, dolphin quest, snorkeling, etc. (or just relaxing); there are plenty of activities to fill ones days. We really enjoyed our 10 days here, and hope a return visit can occur before too long. ", " We came here with our family of 9. The hotel was great. We had 3 nice rooms in the Makai wing of the hotel. Even though this hotel is sprawling, this wing was reasonably close to the lobby and restaurants. The only disappointment was the expensive food choices for average food. Don't let this deter you from staying here. There are plenty of food options outside of the hotel. ", " A very nice place. Good service for an American hotel (average service for an Asian hotel). Construction near the shore was obnoxious during the week (literally jackhammer obnoxious) but this subsided during the weekends and evenings. Amazing views. Parking $27/day. No resort fee if using Hilton Honors points. ", " I was a bit worried about staying here as there were so many reviews criticising the resort for being too expensive and too big but we had an amazing stay here and I would highly recommend it and will definitely return. We stayed for 4 nights in January. We were booked in to a garden view 1 bedroom suite in the Palace Tower but were lucky enough to get upgraded to a larger suite (a Royal suite I think) on the top floor with views on all sides. The suite was amazing, very clean and beautifully furnished. The main bathroom was enormous with a separate shower and bath and a double vanity. There was also a separate \u00bd bathroom with a toilet and basin. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The resort itself was fantastic. We didn\u2019t get a chance to experience everything the resort had to offer as there is so much to see and do. There are 3 swimming pools (1 adult only) as well as the lagoon. The pool nearest the lagoon tower is the largest and has a very big water slide which our kids loved. The smaller one which is between the palace and ocean tower is also great and has a smaller slide and a toddler pool. The water was a bit cold for me but the kids found it warm enough. The lagoon was where we spent most time. It was always easy to find sun loungers \u2013 although you have to be careful as the lagoon is tidal so when the tide comes in it laps around the first row of lounges. We went snorkelling a couple of times. The water was clear and we saw lots of different fish, turtles and even moray eels. We hired the peddle boats and were amazed how much we could see from them \u2013 a good option if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to snorkel. The restaurants are expensive. The cheapest options seemed to be the cantina and the Italian. The cantina was great for lunch and they even offered $5 margaritas. If you want to save money, you can easily walk to the King and Queen shops. We bought groceries for breakfast and drinks from the Island Gourmet shop which saved quite a bit of money. Getting around the resort is easy. Yes, it is big but it was only a 6-minute walk from reception to the Palace Tower and another 5 minutes to the Ocean Tower. Walking is easy, there is a covered walkway with a great collection of artwork. Most of the time we walked but we caught the tram and boat a couple of times just for the experience. At each tower there is an information board with times for the next tram/boat. If you relied on them the whole time if might get a bit frustrating but we were more than happy to walk. We had a hire car and used the valet parking as it was only $5 more and was much more convenient. This was the first of 3 hotels we stayed at in Hawaii (others were in Maui and Waikiki) and this was by far and away my favourite. We will definitely stay again next time we visit the Big Island. ", " We spent 2 nights years ago and it was absolutely breathtaking! The views and the pool area were fantastic. The food was good but pricey which is to be expected at a location like this. There was a shuttle offered to the little shopping area down the road from the resort that was convenient. ", " I enjoyed my stay. The conference room was a nice facility. The resort facilities were excellent. Overall I enjoyed the experience but I did feel the cost of the on sight restaurants exceeded the value. Dona and Tony's pizza would probably be the only exception the food there was excellent and was not too overpriced ", " Extensive property with many activities, shops and beach areas. Golf is also very popular here. Good for the whole family.We ahve stayed here and the property has enough to do that some probably spend there whole time on the premises. ", " It's what you would expect from a Hilton. Customer service was fantastic and everything VERY clean. On grounds restaurants were a little spendy, but food was tasty. Overall, I was quite happy with my overall experience. I would recommend this location for couples or families. The on ground lagoon was very nice. ", " I've stayed at this place twice now and i LOVE it everytime! The rooms are very spacious with large balconies. However the real selling point for this resort is the grounds, gardens and facilities. The resort has a gym, tennis court, dolphin habitat, open to the sea lagoon for snorkelling, 3 large lagoon style swimming pools. There is a gondola style boat as a method of transport around the resort. There is also a monorail to get you around the resort also. There is a full restaurant and also burger bar down by the lagoon. You can easily spend your entire vacation just here enjoying the resort facilities. There is a $25 per day resort fee which is only payable once you arrive. The parking situation is a nightmare. In summer the regular parking is always full so you have to use the valet parking. They don't charge you extra but it is a lot more frustrating when you just want to get our and the resort is full of other people waiting too. The line for check in is also beyond ridiculous. People were waiting for 1/2 hour just to check in. I still love this place and the fabulous resort style. ", " There on business, staff was pleasant and accommodating. However, the feather in their cap are the grounds. Beautiful water features, breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean. Clean and definitely someplace I will stay when I have a family vacation. Only complaint - couldn't get a cup of coffee at 11:00 PM! - seriously!!!???? ", " The hotel and grounds can't be beat. Excellent service. The only thing lacking is a standard 'American style' restaurant as none is on site. Was also informed the nicest of the 3 towers (ocean towers) will be closing in march to convert to time shares....... a BIG DISAPOINTMENT ", " Wow is it in a word that describes this GGVC resort. I love the serenity of this place, there are 3 hot tubs and a endless pool. The slide is awesome. The bar and music was also great. The only draw back is that the music stops at 6:30 and the bar closes at 7pm. We loved the fire pit. All in all a wonderful place to spend two weeks! ", " We stayed a week at the Hilton Waikoloa Village It was a beautiful experience. The grounds are quite large, so do be prepared to walk alot. They do have shuttle train going through the resort to accomodate the guests, but we did not feel the need to take it. The grounds are just so beautiful and well groomed that we did not mind walking. We had a room with an ocean view and was just amazing. Some of the rooms are a little dated but very clean. ", " It was our first visit to Hawaii and we really enjoyed ourselves. The Hilton was an excellent resort and staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We played golf and really enjoyed the course layout. Beautiful area. ", " I won't comment much on the facility as we were at a Hilton. Ok the facility exceeded my expectations. It was simply gorgeous in every aspect. Clean, well maintained and extremely pleasing to the eye. I really could not have asked for more. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our vacation was perfect. As for other reviewers crying about how far they had to walk, I say,\"get a life\". They provide a tram and boat to all the towers. That would be a hassle without them. So that does not justify a negative rating whatsoever. Please be aware that you are on the \"Big Island\", and you should get a rental car. You will see so much more. And don't hesitate to explore on your own. You will save a ton on tours and meet some very nice people. We don't adhere to the philosophy that you must take those expensive land tours. You can see things and experience things the tours don't offer. We even discovered a Costco just south of the Hotel and they will save you .60 cents on a gallon of gas. I drove 1004 miles while we were there and it was worth every penny. The so called land tours don't go to Kilauea at midnight. If you go to Kilauea and want to bike the 4.5 miles, see the last tent on the right. He's fair and a medically retired Iraq Vet. I wish I could share our entire experience with you but that would ruin your joy. ", " This vacation compound keeps any child happy and occupied. Pools (I am mean pools) are hug and they offer water slides with guards on duty during the day, the pools are great for swimming, jumping in and just to cool off and have fun. The Lagoon is another place for water sports activities, great for snorkeling, paddle boating, watching the tropical fish, turtle and just relaxing on the sandy shore. The dolphin quest is out of this world, but pricey. If you happen to swim with them it will create a lifetime of memories. Hilton Waikoloa Village is a great get away place for families with children. ", " 19 miles north of Kona international airport. The hotel is huge and you can get around by monorail, boat or walking. It was a 5 minute walk for us from lobby to the palace tower where we stayed. I reckon this is perfect for family with children since you can get most of what you need from a resort: dolphins,lagoon and pool etc. The activity coordinators were helpful. But 2 of our trips (not hotel related) were canceled due to weather so be prepared for plan B. ", " The property is impressively large which helps burn off the lavish breakfast buffet. I used my points for my stay and that was a great value. I'm glad I did not have to pay list price as that would have been very very expensive. ", " The 90 minute speal went longer and got to hungry! The valet service was great as well as the greeting and departing staff. The weather was great. The art work was fantastic. We upgraded at a discount which was fantastic! Thank you. ", " It is amazing how Hilton integrates the cultural elements into the natural world. In the village, there are boat and tram service which can take guests from points to points and sightseeing all the way. There are different animals and unique geographic sceneries. Very nice. ", " What a fun place to stay. There is something new to discover around every corner. Even though we know this resort has been at this location for some time, everything looks like it was built yesterday. The rooms are big and nice. There are more choices for pools than one really needs but what great choices! All of the staff was very sweet and helpful. We felt like it embodied the true Hawaiian spirit. Even though we went out every day to visit sights around the island one really doesn't need to leave this lovely resort if you just wanted to stay and relax. ", " We arrived here yesterday after a long trip from the Midwest. We were greeted by Gene the bellman who was wonderfully friendly and efficient. We checked in with Kelly who went above and beyond to find us just the right room with a beautiful tropical view. This kind of service has brought us here 3 times before and we will certainly come again.  ", " The hotel is exceptionally luxurious. There is a tram or water boat that travels you around. The pool is fantastic with cascading waterfalls and underneath a hot tub! Just wished they played soft hawaiian music there. ", " My wife and I have traveled all over the world and feel that this is one of the nicest hotels that we've lived in. The rooms are ordinary but the hotel property is simply beautiful. Wonderful to visit with young children. There is plenty of Asian art all over property - almost like a small museum. Has a man made lagoon where you can snorkel (beautiful fish and turtles to be discovered). Lovely swimming pools (2-3 to choose from). The hotel is one of the sites for Dolphin Encounter - depending on your personal views (about captive dolphins), this can be a turn off or an added bonus. I have 2 issues with the hotel:- the on-site restaurants are very pricey and food is strictly ok- self-parking is $27/day and there are really no other good options ", " wonderful place, fantastic staff and great placeevery single staff did their best to please the guesses, each was like an angelspotlessly clean room, heavenly bed, Had the best sleep everI can recommend this place to anyone, DO NOT EVER THINK ANY OTHER HOTEL ", " We have been here 4 days now and we love it! From the moment we arrived, everything has been excellent! Check in was smooth and quick. The man checking us in was friendly and helpful! We stay in the ocean tower and our room is wonderful! Top floor room is the way to go as you get a wonderful view! The coffee shop in our building has long lines but they are quick and efficient(as well as very very friendly)! We have not heard any unwanted noise as other reviews have mentioned! We sleep with just the screen and can hear the ocean all night! I have only seen one cat and it didn't bother or approach anyone! The train is slow but the walk is beautiful anyway! It is an easy walk from ocean tower to the lobby. We only used the train when we first got here as we had luggage! We will stay here again! ", " My travel partners and I found a deal to stay at this resort by booking our inter-island flights and accommodation through the Hawaiian Airlines website, otherwise we would have counted it out for price alone. I'm so glad we stayed here because it was absolutely amazing.The resort is very large and probably best enjoyed by people who are completely mobile and don't mind walking long distances to get from place to place. There is a monorail and a boat system to get people around but neither of those modes of transportation will get you to the more far-out places at the resort such as Buddha Point or the Luau theatre. We stayed in the Makai wing of the Lagoon Tower, closest to the big pool. Being Maikai guests got us access to towels without having to use a card, discounts on things like renting snorkel sets or SUPs, and free access to the hot tub, sauna and steam room at Kohala Spa. We were offered the upgrade at check-in and I'm so glad we did it. The pools aren't heated, which was a little inconvenient because it made getting in the water somewhat uncomfortable, but the lagoon's temperature was great so we did the majority of our swimming there. Everywhere you look at this resort is so beautiful, I can't stress that enough. Just gorgeous. We had the Big Island Breakfast twice, and it was delicious. We ordered some snack foods from the Orchid Market near the big pool and it was very tasty. Food tends to be expensive at the resort so you can always take a $2 shuttle (or walk, it's not that far) to the Queen's Marketplace down the road and eat at any of the restaurants in the food court there. It was so cool to watch the dolphins play in the morning. There were all sorts of gorgeous fish in the lagoon to look at while you snorkeled. I took a ukulele lesson with the lovely instructor Lahela, and since I was the only student that day we found a song by an artist that I liked on YouTube and she taught me the chords for that song. I also made a lei with her and she was honestly so lovely to learn from. She was even there in the morning when I went to see them put the pig in the imu before the luau that night and she was so incredibly friendly. All the staff members I encountered on this trip were very friendly and helpful. If you want to stay in a gorgeous resort with lots of amenities and activities, Hilton Waikoloa Village is definitely the place. ", " This is our first time in Big Island & first time at this hotel. I must tell you, at first it seems overwhelming but we were actually able to walk the whole entire resorts' which was really fun and amazing to see all the art, sculptures and all the artifacts. I'm usually the type to go lay in the beach or the pool and just enjoy the sun, but I did not want to waste my time in the big islands and not see everything. I did designate a day to go in the pool and the beach for a day, this is great for children, family almost everyone. There's enough spots for everyone to view the sunset. You have to sit and watch it it's amazing!! I would definitely go back to this hotel when I visit the big Island. Oh I have to add, concierge via text is the best! Everything I need via text was provided to me, and the best part is when I requested for the TI leaves it came right on time. I want to say thank you to Hilton for making our birthday and anniversary memorable.. ", " Went to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary. upgraded to a suite, it was completely worth it. was given a wonderful bottle champagne--delivered to our room. was also gifted complimentary breakfast @ the Big Island Breakfast buffet--it was wonderful! enjoyed a completely relaxing weekend--so glad we took a couple of days to enjoy our celebration!! ", " We absolutely loved our stay here. Th food in the gourmet stores in the village is pricey, so it is better to bring groceries from further away if you are out and about. The location is not very close to the best sites, like the volcano, but you will enjoy being here. ", " Beautiful location with exceptional grounds. Plenty to see and do. Onsite snorkeling and great pools. Make sure you don't miss the tram or the boats as the walk can be significant from one end of the property to the next (65 acres). If you dine at the hotel plan on spending some serious dollars. Food is great but spendy. Overall a tremendously beautiful location and experience. ", " What a lovely place to be! Beautiful hotel. Beautiful people and the opportunity to do so many things! Helicopter over Volcanoes, Snorkeling, ATV riding in the rainforest. Something for everyone. Just perfect. ", " We had a wonderful time starting with checking in. We enjoyed the tennis clinics (Lianne is such a motivator), the spa (what a way to unwind), the restaurants (loved KPCs-just excellent) and the incredible property. Our week went too quickly. ", " This is my third time at this resort, the others were 20 years ago, and this property still shines. This time I was with my husband and small (active!) children. We all loved it. We stayed in a suite in the Lagoon Tower and really loved it. Our view was of the dolphin pond, with the lagoon and ocean beyond. Such a beautiful view in the morning. The suite was large and comfy, and gave us plenty of room to sleep, watch tv, and have the kids do homework or eat at the big table. There was a small dorm-style fridge in our room, which was useful for drinks and snacks.The resort is massive, and the Lagoon tower has a great location - close enough to walk to the front desk, and it's the closest to the main pool, dolphins, and Lagoon.The main pool is HUGE! It has a nice water slide and a really fun cave/ waterfall area, as well as a sandy area in the pool (kids LOVED that), a wood and rope suspension bridge across it, and 3 hot tubs. The pool is not heated, so it's brisk at first, but once you're used to it, no big deal.. While we were there, the resort was busy enough there were not too many at the pool so we always got the chairs we wanted.We did Dolphin Quest (reviewed separately) and my kids loved it, but they also liked coming out every morning to just see the dolphins. The area was so close we did this every morning on our way to the lagoon. The lagoon is amazing - it is a mix of sandy bottom and lava, so kids could build sand castles and go snorkeling to see the fish hanging out in the rocks. We always saw sea turtles, usually 3 or more, and lots of colorful fish. My kids were thrilled with the snorkeling, and since they are beginners, I was thrilled that a protected area was so close.One day we ventured to the Ocean Tower pools, and they were fun and different. While the main pool is one HUGE pool, the Ocean Tower pools are set up as a grouping of smaller polls, some connected, some not. They were fun as well, but we liked the main pool best.The breakfast buffet was my kids' favorite, and my husband and I liked it as well, but it is pricey and more than we typically eat so we didn't do it every day. There are coffee shows in the Lagoon and Ocean towers, so we did those for a smaller breakfast.My kids loved riding the tram and the boat. They are pleasant and efficient ways to get around. Not necessarily faster than walking, but good if you want to rest. The boat captains were always friendly and talked or waved to us.The concierge desk was helpful in finding tours and things to do on the island, and I utilized them before and during my visit. I found the staff to be professional and practical. Unlike other guests, I did not find that they pushed Hilton-sponsored tours or restaurants - possibly those guests used the tour desk.So, on our way home our flight was cancelled, and we returned to stay one more night. This time in the Palace Tower. It is beautiful, and as my son said, \"The whole place smelled so good!\" The rooms were modern and large and the building had a certain sophistication. We had a nice view of the mountain and the ocean from this room. I think with our younger kids, the Lagoon Tower and it's proximity to the main pool and Lagoon was a better fit for us, but if your group is mainly adults, the Palace Tower would be a great choice. ", " My wife and I are Diamond members of Hilton Honors, but we have achieved diamond status via our frequent stays at Hampton Inns and Doubletrees, not at Hilton resorts. So our stay at the Waikoloa Village Resort was a real treat. Our room (6067) was magnificent. Spacious with a extra-large bath area and walk-in closet. Our front door opened out onto a view pool in the center of the interior of the Oceanview Tower, while our balcony overlooked the golf course, walking trail and rocky shoreline. Just marvelous.This is a huge resort with multiple towers, offering motorboat transportation via a canal that runs from location to location, a state-of-the-art tram train that also connects the different locations and paths and trails that allow you to explore the entire area on foot. The whole property has the amenities and ambiance you would expect of the classier hotels along the Las Vegas strip. An amazing buffet that includes anything you might possibly want for breakfast each morning at the Big Island Breakfast, which is accessible by boast, tram or foot. Valet parking is $30;/day compared to $27 for personal parking. Both use the same lot which is inconveniently distant from the hotel itself.My one complaint was the absence of a true business center, as can be found in almost all other Hilton properties from Hampton Inns on up. Their version of a \"business center\" is three computers and a printer hidden away next to the UPS counter, which means the UPS clerk is unfairly stuck with having to explain the ridiculous accommodations. To make matters even more bizarre, you must scan a credit card to get $5 worth of internet access - in the BUSINESS CENTER! This is an insult and beneath the services any Hilton property should be offering, let alone a resort such as this.ROOM TIP: West wing of the Ocean Tower. Any room ending in 69 \u2013 85 (eg. 1066 \u2013 6066 first floor to sixth floor) provide wonderful ocean views. In my opinion, the higher up the better. If you would like adjoining rooms, ask for an odd-numbered room with the next even-numbered room. The doors between rooms do not provide much noise insulation, which can be annoying if you have noisy neighbors. ", " We were in the Makai tower and very happy with our view of the ocean and the dolphin lagoon. It would be nice to have a couple of options for dining that were less expensive. We are not used to spending $55+ for 2 fish sandwiches and one coke. Food at KPC and Imari were excellent and better justified the price. Don't know how families could afford to eat there. ", " This facility has everything you could possibly want! First class snorkeling in their ocean accessible lagoon. Seaturtles, eels, and many types of tropical fish in a family friendly environment. I would say a rental car is optional at this facility due to its close proximity to world class golf, shopping, beaches, and several onsite restaurants. Tour concierge and a very helpful staff will help you realize whatever adventure you desire. I highly recommend this resort as a must stay. Have had many great vacations to several of the islands but this? This was exceptional! ", " I was a bit apprehensive about staying here, but I'm glad we did. The grounds are beautiful. I am sitting in the sun in front of the ocean tower as I write this. I am surprised at how uncrowded it is. It must be less than half full. We are staying in the palace tower. The rooms are very nice, although I wish they had put me in a room that faces the ocean more. I am in 7259 (at the very front of the building) so we face the side grounds, not the ocean. It is a big place, but peaceful. No need for the tram unless you have difficulty walking. If you are adventurous I would recommend walking along the ocean south towards the Marriott (less than a mile away). It is a nice walk in the morning, and there is a beach there. The Lava Lava club is there too. We plan on going there for happy hour. ", " We stayed at this hotel for a conference and used Hilton Honors points to extend the stay, for a total of two weeks. It was a great base to explore the island from. And we lost five pounds over the two weeks, despite the incredible breakfast buffet due to walking along the museum walk that runs the length of the 61 acre property. Staff is great, facilities are great. ", " The trip was a conference plus 5 days vacation. Loved the boat and tram rides. The highlight was our cliff dinner at KPC. The food was fabulous and the service was spectacular as we watched the beautiful sunset and frolicking whales! ", " I am currently staying in the lagoon tower overlooking the dolphins and the ocean .The resort is huge and has everything here if you don't wish to move outside the area. Walking to shops only 15 min away if you don't want to pay the prices for food and alcohol at resort. If staying in the ocean towers it's a long walk to car so would get valet parking as it's only extra $5. My children ( 20 & 22) did the swimming with the dolphin adventure and loved it . Not cheap but it's a one in a life time experience . Hired a car for our stay and went to the volcanos . Stopped off at a few waterfalls before going to the volcanos. Go at night as you see the lava as it's well worth the long trip . It's 2 1/2 hours Drive to volcanos . We left at 10 am and returned at 10.30 pm . Would love to come back again and just stay here . ", " We were immediately surprised by the sheer size of this hotel. It has a light railway running until 2am to connect all the different locations! Or take the boat. Rooms are generous and well appointed, go for the ocean view option if you get the choice. Takes a while to get used to the hotel layout though. It has children/family friendly pools as well as an adult only one. A natural sea lagoon provides safe seawater swimming and snorkelling -lots of fish to see and green turtles as it is open to the sea. Dolphins in separate pools - you can book to feed/swim with them.Prices are high cos you are a captive market - New York strip steak, while very good cost $55 and all onsite restaurants were similar. Walk to Kings or Queens shops for more reasonable prices.We really enjoyed being able to relax and unwind here after the traumas of LAX passport control and the 24 hours it took to get here!! ", " This is an amazing property! We stayed here for 2 and a half days and it wasn't enough to even scratch the surface of all there is to do here. Beautiful pools, an amazing lagoon, dolphins, restaurants, shops, all amazingly beautiful with artwork and statues. To begin with I was a little nervous because the reviews said you had to ride a tram or boat to your room and I pictured endless walking. And I am not much of a walker. However the rooms and the attractions are all integrated so there wasnt half as much walking as I expected and when you do walk it is so beautiful you just want to keep going. There are a lot of steps but I even got used to those. The only time we rode the tram was to get to a restaurant that was far away and when we checked out with our luggage. We rode the boat just to get a tour of the whole property.We stayed in the lagoon tower which I highly recommend for its proximity to everything. The room was large and our balcony overlooked the lagoon and and the dolphin pools. The view was stunning. The room was large, very clean, and comfortable, with a large sink area, but cramped shower area. We found the safe on the last day, it was in a drawer of the dresser. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was great each day...it is pricey at $ 32 but if you are a Hilton gold member it is only $10 which is great. Service throughout the hotel property was good but not exceptional.The lagoon area is beautiful. We swam there...crystal clear and sandy bottom, and we snorkeled there and saw many fish and sea turtles. We rented a cabana...you rent for the entire day..pricey at $100 but well worth it I thought...not only do you get comfortable and shady but you get a cooler, a safe for your valuables while you swim, a USB charger for your phone, and attendants who come around with ice cold face towels, bottled water, ice pops, and the ability to order food and drink from the grill. We didn't use the pools since I am allergic to chlorine but they are amazing creations.We did do a dolphin encounter which was quite impressive. This was something I wanted to do and my husband did it with me but was afraid it would be a bunch of little kids and us but it was very adult oriented and we got to know three dolphins and it was quite interesting. The dolphins are amazing and it must take a lot on their part to interact so trustingly with strangers, although I am sure that trust is really in their excellent caregivers and trainers.We ate at several of the restaurants and bars and food was very good. On the whole we felt very pampered and the beauty of the place made it a special experience which I would definitely want to come back to and just spend more time at the resort. It is like a Disneyland. Just walk the grounds, there are beautiful places everywhere. We kept discovering new things each day. I highly recommend this place and don't be scared by its size! ", " Excellent attentiveness, beautiful land and water. I was afraid from other review that it might be carnival-like, but we had lots of peace and relaxation. Service was friendly, not pushy, extremely helpful. ", " Friendly staff, stunning property and a new attitude towards delivering the brand. We felt welcomed at every stop on the property, renovated rooms in the Palace Tower looked great. Dinner at the KPM and sitting and watching the sunset a must do for couples. Swimming in the bay with the turtles and all species of fish was very special. ", " The hotel is a fully engulfing experience. So much within walking or shuttle distance. This is a vacation, its own world get away. Five years ago we stayed in the hotel and just completed a stay in a condo in the Kingsland section. My wife and I much preferred the hotel to the condo. Oh the condo has a few more amenities such as a TOTO Washlet on the toilet, a fantastic shower, dishes, silverware, microwave/convection oven, washer/dryer, etc., but the hotel has so much more activity, valet parking attendants to greet you, people coming and going, great swimming areas within walking distance, the lagoon, beautiful sunsets, etc. There can be some walking between the hotel room and entrance, but those are healthy and interesting walks filled with singing birds. We met more people in going there one evening to watch the sun go down than in our whole stay at the condo. This could have been totally by chance & certainly only one couple's opinion! Oh yes, the whole place is artificial, new and quite out of sync with the natural ecosystem for that part of the island, should have plants that thrive with very little rainfall, etc; but it makes a wonderful play ground. ", " This is a very nice property. Rooms are modern and fresh, restaurants and bars are clean with great food and drink options. There are a number of pools with water slides to keep it fun! And for those who need it, there are a tram and boat for transportation on the property. ", " Great room with balcony and incredible view on the 6th floor in the Ocean Tower. Incredibly family friendly resort with enough activity options to keep everyone busy without leaving the resort. Snorkeling in the lagoon with tropical fishes and sea turtles was great for our 5 year old grand daughter. The staff accommodated us with ocean view room upgrades and put our two room in very close proximity to each other on short notice and in a \"sold out\" situation - so they deserve praise. While the hotel was completely sold out, we really didn't feel it. The buffet breakfast restaurant seemed to handle a capacity crowd well and service was generally prompt. Short wait times to get seated even during peak demand time periods - and walk right in if you arrive before 8:00 AM (not a problem for those coming from the states and whose bodies are still on stateside time zones). The monorail like tram was cool and the boats made for relaxing transport within the resort property (which is huge). The Dolphin Encounter staff knew how to engage children and gave our granddaughter an experience she will never forget. It is an excellent family get away resort. Thumbs up! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort is truly a slice of paradise for anyone who wants to get a good rest. The grounds are beautiful, and the atmosphere peaceful. The rooms in the upgraded accomodations we selected were impressive. Our room had a great view of the lagoon designed for easy access to the water for swimming, and the dophins who put on quite a show for most of the day. The facility is huge so take your comfortable sandals and plan on a lot of walking. The hamburger at the grill near the lagoon and dophins is not to be missed for a casual and delicious meal. Our only disappointment was the lack of beach access. The island only has lots of lava all over everywhere which was interesting to see. ", " You have probably noticed I have been to many places and had written many reviews but this by far is worth elaborating. This is a large resort but with a great team and run so well you feel welcomed and at home by the team members. The General Manager, Mr. DAVID GIVENS I General Manager provided us an updated to an Ocean View Room as Gold Members and made us feel more than special. From check in with Edward (Truly the Best) even with a line he went over all the restaurants, activities, ways to get around and the Cove and Pools. They offer both Self and Valet parking and because the resort is large I think this depend on which tower you are in. ", " This amazing resort has beach access, views of the mountains and ocean. The pools are amazing for kids and adults. waking up to hear the ocean is amazing. Local shopping is a fantastic way to avoid some of the costs of the food ob property. ", " This is a beautiful property set along the rugged coast of the Big Island. There is no accessible beach On property, but the many pools and the large lagoon make up for that. We spent most of our day at the adults only pool. It was quiet and relaxing compared to the other pools.There is a variety of onsite and near by offsite dining options that we had plenty of dining options to choose from. The property is very large and quite a walk from one side to the other. No worries though as they have a train and a boat that can ferry you around. We didn't use either but just enjoyed the walk along the beautiful grounds. Overall great stay! ", " We just stayed here for 4 nights for a conference and it was a great place. The resort is really huge and they have a monorail and boat to get you around the entire place. The staff was really friendly and was there for us for whatever we needed.There is also a bus that goes around waikiloa village that takes you to the different shops, malls and other resorts for $2 a person or you can do the short walk between places. Our room was great. We had a mountain view room at the lagoon tower in the makoi section. I would highly recommend that section. We got a free upgrade since we are HHonors members. The room was clean, and spacious. There is high speed wifi throughout the property which was great since the cell phone service was spotty. Only thing that really sucked was that the beach here was not swimmable. We had to head to the Marriott for that. Another thing that isn't the best is that this place is at least an hour - 2.5 hour drive from all the major tourist sites such as the Volcano, the waterfalls and the lava viewing area. ", " Great Location! Centrally located on the big Island. Less than 20 miles from Kona airport. Excellent service, easy access to the beach, golf courses and numerous outdoor activities. Very relaxing environment. 45 min drive to Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa mountains. 90 minute drive to Volcano National Park. Priceless views along any drive from the hotel. ", " We love coming to this resort. The staff are so helpful and nice, especially Nicholas at the front desk!!!They take pride in keeping everything clean and beautiful. Everyone in our family has their favorite activity. From water slides, to snorkeling in the saltwater lagoon, to lounging in the hammocks! This is our go to place on the Big Island. You won't be disappointed! ", " The property is breath taking . The staff aims to please . My wife and daughters swam with the dolphins, it was a lifetime memory !! The girls loved paddle boarding and swimming in the lagoon, especially with the turtles . Dinner on the ocean maybe the best setting in the whole world . ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is one of the most fun and relaxing places I have stayed. We have been coming for many years and we're never disappointed. We usually venture out in our car to explore the island, but we mostly used the bus and stayed within the village this time. I like that we have the option. We enjoyed the extensive pools and gorgeous sunsets. The breakfast buffet was lovely with a nice view. Within the extensive grounds, we usually walked to get exercise and enjoy the artwork, but the boats and monorail are always fun. This will be a family destination for many more years to come. ", " Whether you are planning a quiet and relaxing getaway for two or for the whole family, this is a wonderful choice. There are planned activities for children that enable parents to have some time for themselves. Restaurants on site are great!Many chartered activities leave from there, but great shopping is within walking distance. This is a resort to which to return! ", " So, reviews here tend to be a little mixed. I think that's because folks have varied tastes. I will say, however, that our stay here for a recent conference was absolutely spectacular. Our room in the Palace Tower was comfortable, spotless, and the perfect home base for our Big Island adventure.This was our very first trip to Hawaii, and this experience made sure that we shall return. We were immediately greeted in the lobby, and even though the \"line\" at the check-in desk was only two deep, the Concierge called us over and insisted on doing our check-in.Getting around is a bit of a lazy hike, but you know, this is Island Life, after all, and I think the short walks made us slow down a bit and enjoy things, rather than merely run, run, run around like our Mainland selves wanted to do initially. For those with small children, or with heavy bags, they have a tram and a canal with shuttle boats - enjoy these. It was fun cruising about with our kids.The magnificent centerpiece of the resort is the \"Lagoon\" the hotel complex is built around. Do not ignore this - it is so much fun! Sure, there are several pools, with their own waterfalls and water slides, but they are relatively cold and to be honest, not as fun as the Lagoon! Buy a snorkel set from the store in King's or Queen's market down the street, and use it to enjoy watching the turtles and fish in the Lagoon. If you own a thin neoprene shirt, it's a good time to use it, since the waters are your typical Pacific Ocean temperature - cool. Easy to get used to, but pretty cool.The restaurants are quite good, but extremely expensive here. If there were one \"weak point\" for this place, I would say it's the price points for eating here. It's probably $10-20 more expensive per appetizer and entree than usual. Imari is especially pricy (yet it is still quite good) for a hibachi / sushi place. Think Nobu prices at Benihana quality. Solid, but $11 for two pieces of tuna (not o-toro), salmon, ikura, or yellowtail is pretty high. The rolls get even more expensive. The KPC is very pricy, but their ginger infused steamed Monchong is one of my absolute favorite dishes I've ever had. Yep.Rent a convertible from the local rental places and explore the island for several day trips - we enjoyed the Northwest corner of the island (see my Sushi Rock review). Go nuts - enjoy the Big Island to the fullest with this great resort as your home base. We shall definitely be back. Mahalo! ", " The west side of the Big Island of Hawai'i is peppered with all sorts of luxury resorts. This all befits the home and summer vacation spot for Hawaiian Royalty.As you travel North out of the bustling town of Kailua-Kona you come upon the manicured lawns with shops and restaurants at Waikoloa. This is where you find the enormous resort that is the Hilton Waikoloa Village.It is a beautiful resort covering many acres with ponds, lagoons, pools, restaurants, boat rides and tram rides and even Dolphin Quest. It rivals the Disney Parks and their rides.As a hotel, it is vast. Rooms are scattered over various towers. You can travel to your room by tram or boat or along corridors overflowing with antiquities and precious artworks.You could stay here, enjoy your vacation and not see all the other sites of the Island. That's how vast we're talking! Don't do that, but do enjoy this special resort. ", " Best vacation location if you are going to Kona Hawaii. Hotel was designed well with all its swimming pools and its lagoon swimming area where you are actually swimming with fish and even turtles from the ocean. Hotel employees were very professional. ", " I grew up on the Big Island, so staying at the Hilton was always such a huge treat! I spent my Winterballs and Proms here for years! This past December, my sister (who now lives in Washington State) came home with my niece so we decided that it would be fun to spend a night/day down at the hotel. When we got there on a Saturday afternoon around 5pm it was PACKED! The lobby was full of people who were checking in and they had some of their staff coming around with little slips of paper for guests to fill out to speed up the check-in process for everyone. When we finally got to check in, we were upgraded to an Ocean Front room (from a Garden View one)! #WinningThe weather was pretty crappy for most of the evening, so we were contained to our room. But with a 1 year old and a 4-year old, the size of the room, the closet, the blankets, and everything else in there were enough to keep them both occupied, entertained, and having fun for hours. We didn't end up dining at really anywhere on property except the Waikoloa Coffee Company (which is the same company as Honolulu Coffee Company), the next morning. The service was great, the gals that were working were really sweet and helpful and immediately knew we were kama\u2018\u0101ina! (Yes, you get a discount.) The food was a bit overpriced, I paid close to $70 for 5 people - includes coffee & breakfast + tip. But it was worth it! That same morning, we asked for a late check out and ended up getting a 1:00pm check-out time. We went to the pool first thing in the morning at 8:00am and it was cold! Hah. The pool guys were still cleaning, which was kind of lame, since it made us feel like we couldn't jump in the pool, but when we asked them about it, they said we could and were really nice.We were crazy hungry by 9:00am since we'd eating 4 hours earlier, but the little cafe wasn't open until 11:00am! My boyfriend and step-daughter had to walk pretty far to the closest Waikoloa Coffee Company, where they were only able to bring back chips and water. We were anxiously waiting for the pool bar to open, which I think was supposed to be at 10:30am, but they ended up opening early! We were stoked. All-in-all, we had a great time here. The Hilton Waikoloa Village still is and will probably always be, one of my favorites! ", " We have been here multiple times over the years as our daughters grew up. Now we came to the resort as empty nesters. We still love it. We find something different on each visit. We love the ocean tower. Yes, it is 3/4 mile walk from the front lobby but great way to stay in shape and get your steps in. The walk is beautiful. During the walk you see many beautiful types of artwork: pictures, statues, quilts, and more. If walking isn't for you then take the tram or boat. We had an ocean view room. The rooms are large and comfortable. Each room has a balcony. There is a nice adults only pool by the ocean tower along with a coffee shop and store. There is a restaurant and bar, Boat Cantina, right there at the end of the tram line. We were able to bring drinks to our room and to the pool. The Hilton has now beach but you are right next door to an amazing beach and bay. We would walk along the coast to the Anaehoomalu Bay. A must see. The Hilton works with Ocean Sports and they are located by the Lagoon and Bay. Great water sport rentals and whale watching trips. We will be back to the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " We booked Christmas day luau at the Hilton and are so very glad we did. We've done a number of luaus but this was the best. We opted for the more expensive package and that, too, we were glad of. Sometimes it's really not worth the extra cost but this time it was. Our seating was closer to the stage, drinks were free and we had first crack at the buffet. The food was plentiful and truly excellent with many gluten-free items available and labeled, I appreciated that very much. The show was magnificent, particularly the fire dancing. We've seen fire dancing in many places, including Mexico, but this performance was simply superb. The Hilton staff managed a great number of guests this evening in a professional manner. Everyone got a fresh lei upon arrival. ", " great food, nice staff, amazing bedroom. I was not satisfied with the luau closing time and got to be refunded : that was really niceeverything has to be paid : resort fee per day, parking fee 25$ per day ", " My husband and I returned from our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village over a week ago, and I still cannot stop thinking about what a phenomenal time we had! After doing a lot of research on various resorts, we decided to book our vacation at the HWV, and we are thrilled that we did. I read numerous reviews on this site about this resort, so we basically had an idea of what to expect, including many complaints from other reviewers. However, these \u201cissues\u201d did not bother us at all. As far as the long walk to the parking lot, yes, it is far, but after the first day, we figured out to use the scenic walking paths that cut through the resort by the lagoon to get to the main entrance, and the distance is much shorter, plus the view is breathtaking. Throughout the five days we were there, we truly did not feel we had that long of a wait for the tram, either. One time, just as we were walking up to the tram, it did leave at that moment and, for a few seconds, we were disappointed that we missed it. But, then, we realized that we were in paradise and a little walk to breakfast wasn\u2019t going to be the end of the world, so we just shrugged it off and burned a few calories before our huge buffet bonanza. Other reviewers also complained about loud birds, and I do not doubt that was their experience, but we stayed in a ground-floor room in the Ocean Tower and we were not awakened by the birds one time. The most pleasant surprise to us was the fact that, although we were there during the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, the resort never felt crowded. There were always lounge chairs available by the pools, and even the ones at the lagoon didn\u2019t even fill up until very late in the morning. We\u2019ve cruised numerous times, and it seems as if the lounge chairs on the ships are all \u201ctaken\u201d by 8:00 a.m. (people saving them for later, which is just incredibly inconsiderate). I am someone who feels very uncomfortable in highly crowded situations, and I never felt that one time. More positives include the fact that the buffet breakfast is run like a well-oiled machine. Even though there was usually a line when we arrived, it went quickly and we did not have to wait more than 15 minutes for a table. The food was always fresh and there was quite a variety, with various dishes rotated in and out each day. We also took in the luau one evening and it was highly entertaining. The dancers and musicians were top notch, and they even did a cute parody of the \u201c12 Days of Christmas\u201d, since we were actually there on Christmas night. I wish I would have recorded that one. We also treated ourselves to KPC one evening, and it was spectacular, as well. We sat at a table at the edge of the patio, overlooking the ocean, at sunset. Glorious. We also had delicious meals at The Lagoon Grill and Kona Tap Room, as well as the tableside guac at the Boat Landing Cantina (yes, they were all overpriced, but we also knew what to expect beforehand so it wasn\u2019t a surprise). Finally, the dolphins being in the resort were the icing on the cake. I could have stayed and watched the dolphins swim and play all day. The only negatives that really come to mind would be the fact that the boat fumes from the exhaust were very overpowering. We only took the boat once and we sat in the back, so if you sit in the front, then maybe that\u2019s not an issue. For us, it was so bad that we exited before the actual stop we wanted to get off at because I thought I might pass out. As far as the accommodations, although we were very impressed by the size of the room and didn\u2019t think it was as outdated as other reviews that I had read, the interior hallways are extremely drab, painted white, with just a piece of artwork and a table every so many feet where there is an alcove. A fresh coat of colorful paint would do wonders.Any time we are able to travel back to Hawaii, we will return to the HWV in the hopes that we will have the same magical experience as this one. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Resort is wonderful. Everything is available at your fingertips. A great resort to relax, exercise of treat yourself to a spa specialty. Breakfast buffet is amazing, plenty of dining options and the tram is fun to ride. Excellent guest service and the aloha spirit is truly beyond words. ", " We arrive in the night of January 3rd, and stayed four nights in a room in Ocean tower. Although Ocean tower is a little further away from main lobby, the resort has trams and boats to take guests to where ever they need to go, and we all enjoyed sights of beautiful landscape in rides. We could see ocean and golf landscape from our balcony, and waterfalls and pond ( there are golden fish and a black swan in pond) from the other side, once we opened our front door. The first night we were waken up by cats and birds near 4:00am, the rest of three nights were peaceful. The resort has many water activities (water slides, swimming, snorkeling, paddle boats, swimming with dolphins, etc.) and Laura. We enjoyed very much its stunning landscape. It is best to see and take a walk to enjoy its beauty with dedicated statues, beautiful garden with flowers, fish and sea birds. The buffet breakfast at Big Island Breakfast near water edge is great, it offers so many choices, we loved fresh papayas, miso soup, fried rice, delicious bread pudding with macadamia nut and coconut. Nearby, there is King's Market place, and Queen's Market place. Both places have restaurants and gift shops (the resort also has its own resturants). In Queen's Market Place, there is a store called Island Gourmet Markets, we bought our take-out lunches, cook to order dinners and souvenirs, fruits there as we are always on the go. We planned to stay there longer to enjoy more of this beautiful resort in next visit. ", " We really enjoyed the hotel and its many offerings. The food was great and the staff was very helpful. We really enjoyed the Dolphin Quest and swimming wit the dolphins. A great place to stay on the Big Island. ", " This place has it all. The ocean, multiple pools, restaurants, coffee shops & more. If you don't want to leave the property, you can have an enjoyable day onsite. The location is close to the airport as well as primary roads. The rooms are nice, large & well appointed. We look forward to returning. ", " From arrival to getting an upgrade to Makai too the resort as a whole , this place is beautiful, relaxing and inviting. The staff was very responsive and pleasant. I will likely return! Mahalo. Make sure to walk down the beach to Lava Lave Beach club! ", " My wife and I spent a week earlier this month (March 2017) at the Hilton with a package deal thru Costco Travel. We found it to be an amazing place with numerous swimming pools, restaurants and shops. When in Hawaii, prices for everything are always higher than on the mainland and the Hilton is no exception. In our package deal we got a fantastic breakfast buffet included, but if you were paying extra, it was a bit pricey. We had a room in the Ocean Towers (starting May first the towers will be closed and renovated into timeshares). Our room was large and very comfortable but a little outdated. Getting around the resort was easy using the tram or the canal boats. The Hilton is very family oriented which was nice to see. All the staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. We do want to go back and take our Grandkids so they can participate in the Dolphin Quest program. If you have a car, the self parking fee is $27 a day. We really enjoyed our stay and are working on another trip back. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a week in November and loved it. We had a 2 bedroom suite with a full kitchen and it was very spacious and worked great for our trip. We had a great view of the pool and golf course. ", " Had an amazing time at this hotel. The food leaves a little to be desired as it isn't up to scratch for what you pay for it. The rooms do need some refurbishment, but the facilities more than make up for it with the amazing pools. The tram and boat make it easy to get around the hotel, special mention to Andrew (boat/tram operator) who clearly loved his job and was a delight each time we saw him. Whilst there's a heap of walking required, the hotel is a destination in itself so it's definitely worth it. A must see and we will be back. ", " Wonderful stay in the Makai tower. Huge pool area. Chairs around pool were always easy to find, however seats at the beach around the lagoon would fill up fast. Pool water was too cold if it wasn't sunny out. Great breakfast buffet with omelet bar. We would definitely return. ", " Great place. Lots to do and very beautiful. The grounds were well maintained. Friendly people and a great view. Pool was large and not crowded. Tram and boat to take you to all the locations in the property. ", " We stay here during our pit stops. The staff are always great and the food is awesome. Looking forward to visiting again. The tram and most rides are always a perk that we enjoy. Like allot of the other contributors I agree that the food prices are bit costly, but good. I don't travel with family but can see that the lagoons and tanks are a real hit for families. The hotel is not too far from the retail shops and seeing that I travel allot, I always have to find a new gift for my son. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is your dream destination when you hit Hawaii. Upon arrival you are either whisked away via monorail, boat or (your feet) to your room and the fun begins from there. With a number of pools, children's play areas, lagoons, dolphin tanks and restaurants there is honestly something here for everyone. The Lagoon features a number of \"ocean type\" activities along with sand, fish etc. Or you can head over to have lunch and watch the Dolphins swim, play, and even swim with them if that's your thing!The Hotel itself is located about a 15-20 minute walk to the closest shops which is perfect if you don't want to rent a car. ", " The property has three hotels, three swimming pools, and a lagoon that is open to the sea. In the lagoon you can snorkle and see tropical fish, turtles, sometimes a stingray comes in. There are resturants on property or you can take a shuttle up to Kings Town for serious shoppiing and excellent dining. Roy's is excellent. Also queens Town has a shopping Market so you could get breakfast items and other food if you wanted. The whole area is beautifully landscaped and the breese is usually very refreshing. It is a great place for kids also. ", " Stayed here 5 years ago, and was thrilled to come back. This is still my favorite beach resort for families anywhere, and I preferred it to the Grand Wailea as well as to two all-inclusives in Mexico. I won't repeat everything I said last time, but I want to respond to the people who say it is too massive and feels like Disneyland. I NEVER took the Monorail the whole time, nor the boats. I stayed in the Lagoon Tower (\"Makai\"), and to me that it is practically its own resort by itself. Not only do the rooms have really phenomenal views, but it is so convenient to everything you need. And this is so much more gorgeous and uncrowded than Kanapali or Waikiki.--Waikoloa Coffee Company (base of Lagoon Tower): very good coffee, and lots of relatively inexpensive choices for breakfast and lunch (this is Hawaii after all, so food costs more than the mainland). Loved the Acai Bowl for lunch (about $10). The Caprese sandwich was very good too. Also liked the warm croissants for breakfast.--Ice Cream: also right near Lagoon Tower. Tropical Dreams is phenomenal!! Grabbing different flavors each day (choc coco mac nut, for instance, or peanut butter snickers, or Tahitian vanilla) was a highlight for our family.--Shopping: I am not a huge shopper, esp. when I'm on vacation. But the Lagoon Tower has so many little boutiques that are not expensive. Where else can you be at a beachfront four-star hotel and you're paying $15 for adorable earrings and $30 for coverups, in the hotel's own stores? Loved that I could sneak away to buy cute sundresses for that evening since I hadn't had time to shop before trip.--Beach path!!!!!! This is one of my favorite things about the hotel, and makes it for me the most spectacular of any beach resort I've been to in the last 10 years. On the one hand, the hotel has every amenity that you need, lots of restaurants and stores, a spa, a gym, etc. But if you walk 5 mins. away from the Lagoon Tower, you are on a spectacular rocky path going alongside the water, in nature away from people, and it's heaven. I brought my hiking shoes, since you're walking on lava rocks, but it is so beautiful and peaceful. --Beach chairs: we were there just before Christmas time, and precisely because the hotel is so big we NEVER had a problem finding chairs at the Lagoon Tower or Ocean Tower pools. So many other hotels, if you don't wake up early in the morning and mark your territory, you lose it. Not here. Easy enough to get a spot, because there are tons of chairs around all of the pools, and people are doing a lot of other things. (this is the case not at the lagoon itself though - there seating is limited)--Pools: we did not get bored. In addition to the water slide at Lagoon Tower pool, we also spent time in the Lagoon itself. My son was thrilled by getting to swim alongside tropical fish and turtles, as well as kayak, bike-boat, pedalboat, etc. At 10, he loved the hotel as much as when he was 5. And the Lagoon pool never felt crowded. Very lovely, and with hot tubs in the grottos.Other things:--Restaurants in the hotel are ok, but you're near so many other great places in Waikoloa within a 5-15 min. drive. We loved the atmosphere at Lava Lava Club...and the food at Pueo's, Koa Table and Mai Grille. We also liked driving to the Shops at Mauna Lani to go to Monstera Sushi.--It's great having King's Shops and Queen's Marketplace nearby - easy to buy snacks, and to go shopping at Macy's if there is anything you forgot. The shuttle there is very easy.--Spa: am leaving a separate review for treatments, but if you are staying in Lagoon Tower (Makai), you automatically get to use the facilities at any time. Nice bonus!--Valet: very efficient compared to other places we have stayed. It's great getting your car when you need it to go out!One other thing: if you're a reader, bring lots of books!!! They don't sell ANY BOOKS except for children's books anywhere in the resort, and the same is true at Queen's Marketplace! ", " We stayed at this property from December 25th through the 30th. I am a Hilton Diamond member, and as such received excellent service while staying there. Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean. It was great that we were able to dine at the very good buffet every morning without extra charge as part of our gold/diamond benefits. Otherwise buffet would cost $35 per person for full buffet. We stayed at the Palace Tower which was recently renovated. Nicely done, and rooms were spacious. Other than the suites, the 'ocean views' from all rooms in this tower are really only partial ocean views, even from the top floor. Not worth the extra cost if your're paying cash for your room (as opposed to using points).Although we stayed there at one of the busiest weeks of they year, other than the buffet at peak times, the hotel did not feel crowded, and poolside lounges were readily available all day long. It can be a LONG walk from your room to the lobby, but we knew that before we booked. The tram and boat service run about every 10-15 minutes between all buildings and the main lobby. As for parking, I highly recommend valet. Only a small incremental difference between self-parking and valet, and when we called fro our car from our room, it was waiting for us by the time we got to the lobby.The one gripe I have about the hotel is that many rooms have entries that face the interior courtyards. All of these rooms are 'forward' of the elevator bank in the Palace Tower. The entries to these rooms are somewhat exposed to the elements and as such have tile floors outside. Unlike carpeting, these floors can reflect a lot of noise - ie children running, rolling suitcases bouncing over the tiles, etc. If you stay in this tower, I recommend getting a room towards the back of the building, where the floors are carpeted. While there is no beach on the property, there is a salt water lagoon. Two great public beaches - Kua Bay and Hapuna beach are 10 minutes or less from the hotel. In addition the many pools on property are all quite nice.All-in-all we had a great stay there, and would recommend it to others. Just know that you need to allow for ample time to get from your room to the main lobby. ", " Memorable 45th Anniversary stay for Diamond VIPS. First class treatment for returning guests. Confirmed why this is one of our favorite properties around the world. We will be back many times in the future. ", " Just returned with my family of four from a 8-night stay over Christmas. Was a little concerned because of negative reviews of resort size, distance, deferred maintenance, cost, cost and distance of parking, even birds squawking at 4.00 in the morning. Yes, it is large. Breakfast can be pricey. Boat and tram can be slow and not worth the effort. But the setting! The ocean views! The dolphins! The well-landscaped grounds! The choice of pools. We upgraded to at the Lagoon Tower and it was very much worth it. When we got tired of the corporate feel, we would walk 15 min to A-Bay or take a 20 min cab ride to Hapuna Beach, a very highly rated beach (all beaches are public) on the island. Plus the concierge in every building are there to help plan activities. ", " Lovely hotel with lots of pools and walking paths. Nice pools for the kids. Resort is large and everything is spread out. Lots of stairs. Maybe not the best for individuals physical limitations. The dolphin quest is on the property ", " We stayed December 2016 in palace tower. The suite was very nice and open with plenty of room. The view from the lanai was of the ocean. There was plenty of room for all of our snorkeling and swimming gear, including drying space on the multiple lanais. I had rented a bike and there was plenty of room to store that inside as well. The resort is very big, so there was a lot of walking. Valet always got the car out by the time we made it to the front. It is a very expensive resort for our family of five though. ", " We ended up splurging on the ocean view room (Ocean Tower) at the most expensive time of year. Totally worth it. We never left the resort because everything we needed was right there. A too little family friendly if you're looking for a romantic getaway, but we found some quiet relaxing time. The hotel was at capacity when we were staying there, so the luau was booked. Photo is our view from our room. Spectacular! ", " This is our second time visiting the Big Island and second time staying at this hotel. We love this hotel because it offers plenty.This time around we stayed in the Ocean Tower rooms (previously it was in Lagoon Tower). The Ocean Tower rooms are nice. We stayed in a Two Queen Bedroom. Room was very spacious with plenty of space for our belongings. Bathroom was clean with separate sink area.We would not mind staying here for a third time if ever the chance comes to us. This is a great resort hotel located at Waikoloa area of Big Island.Pros:- very nice property with many swimming pools (for all ages).- location is inside the Waikoloa Resorts area.- there are many restaurants on site however we did not eat at any because we usually go to Island Gourmet Market a short drive away at Queen's Marketplace complex to buy food and other groceries.- the grounds of this hotel is very big and nice to walk around. Plenty to see and experience. Live birds can be found roaming around the grounds.- there is a Lagoon that has ocean wildlife swimming in. Guests can swim there, snorkle as well as do other water activities.- the sunset view from Buddha Point is a must for everybody. It is really awe inspiring.- safe provided in the room as well as mini fridge.- free video and game rental is part of the room/resort fee. We rented movies to watch in our rooms and games to play in our room at night.- complimentary (sign up) classes is given on a daily basis. We took the Introductory Ukulele class which was good experience.- Boat ride takes guests around the complex. This was really fun to ride.Cons:- the grounds of this hotel is very big and if want to get from Ocean Tower to lobby by walking it may take a good 20-30 minutes. Must take the Tram to do so more effectively.- the parking lot is far away and there is a daily fee for parking there. Also finding parking may be hard at times. ", " An attraction in itself this resort is an amazing place to stay wether is be a couple or family, so much on offer food wise as well as water slides, mini golf and getting up close with dolphins! Would love to stay here again! ", " We stay here every other year for 9 days. I love the pool and water slide which I hang out for at least 2 hours a day. The hotel is beautifully landscaped and only draw back is how long it takes to get from your room to your car. Try to stay in mid towers, the two on the ends are loaded with kids. The restaurants are very pricey! Best to ask locals where to eat. There are some amazing restaurants in town. ", " I have stayed in Hiltons all around the world, but never one as lovely as this Hilton and in such an extraordinary location. Staff were without exception helpful and pleasant. We had booked a mountain view room but were offered an upgrade for $50 per night to ocean view room upon arrival. This was absolutely worth it. We had the most beautiful view overlooking the resort, Dolphin Quest and the ocean. We were in the Makai area Lagoon Tower room 6723 ocean fronting. If you can afford ocean view, so worthwhile. Room was contemporary, large and very comfortable.It is a very large resort so be prepared to either walk a lot or take the tram. The closest area to the lobby is the Lagoon Tower which is where we were. Also closest to beautiful salt water lagoon (a highlight) and beautiful pools. There's a frequent shuttle for $2 per head to the local shops. Some of the restaurants were closed whilst we were there. We ate at the Boat Landing Cantina which was good and then we took the boat back to our room. The Lagoon Grill and Orchid Marketplace which were OK. There is no beach area. The closest is a 20 minute walk (A-Bay) along a beachfront trail. Worth taking the walk to see some of the surrounding area and A Bay a lovely beach will all the necessary amenities.Most of our swimming was in the Lagoon. We did snorkelling (swimming with a giant sea turtle at one point which was a highlight), stand up paddling, kayaking. Pools at the lagoon good temperatures.I would definitely recommend this Hilton. If you can, take a tour to the Mauna Kea summit and stars adventure tour. So worth it. ", " Although this property is a bit on the expensive side, there is a reason! Two large pools with great slides, a lagoon that is fed by the ocean with a small beach, tide pools, golf, shopping etc there is plenty to do! The food in the restaurants is spendy (like most of Hawaii!) but it is high quality and delicious! A great place for the whole family! ", " Our family of 4 stayed here for 10 days over Christmas. Great location, wonderful grounds, amazing staff. We ate Big Breakfast almost every morning (my only negative to this resort is there is only 1 real breakfast area and it was very crowded a few of the days we were here. Suggestion - open up another breakfast area on the resort). We rented cabanas one day at the lagoon and it was fabulous. KPC was the restaurant we chose to celebrate a birthday. Outstanding views with incredible food. Overall a stay that will not soon be forgotten. Thank you Hilton! ", " We have been bringing our kids here since there were tots and now as teens we were worried they would roll their eyes about \"not this again,\" but once again they have been happy with the wide range of offerings. There is so much that no family will likely do it all. We don't do the golf for example, though there are at least 2 courses on premises with discounts for guests at the hotels, and numerous other courses nearby. That is not our thing these days. But we use the pools galore, play tennis, use the beaches, usually do at least one adventure activity each trip, and enjoy the atmosphere. We especially like walking the grounds of the Hilton Hotel. Though built in the 70's some of its ongoing uniqueness make it fun every time. The Asian Art collection is everywhere, in outdoor walkways, by pools, in the restaurants and lobbies. It is beautiful, museum quality. We have hired photographers in the past who met us on premises as it's a great place for a photo shoot. The free boats and trains to get around are fun to ride whether you are weary or just wanting a change. For guests or those willing to pay a day use fee, the pool is extensive and the lazy river especially fun. There are lots of nice places to sit on chairs (provided) and enjoy the sun and surf.The resort has two great shopping areas - the Queens Shops (newer) and the Kings Shops. There are a range of national and local stores with eateries and coffee shops mixed in. For those who need them, public restrooms are never too far away. Though the place is upscale and there's lots to pay for and enjoy, they've put out lots for people to enjoy as you amble about without fees, some of it named above. This is a great place to base your island get away - you might not want to go off premises at all. ", " Waikoloa Village is my favorite place in Hawaii. It is always sunny and a calm place to stay. When I arrived at the hotel I was overwhelmed with the size of the hotel. It took a little time to understand how to get around. You can always walk around the property but with suitcases we took the little train since it is more convenient than the boat. The lagoon tower is the closest one of the lobby area and the closest one to the big pool and lagoon. We had an Ocean View and could see the lagoon and the pool where the dolphins stay - I know they are well treated and people like to have a dolphin experience but it made me very sad to see them so close to the ocean and trapped in a pool.The lagoon was a fun part because my mother-in-law is not very courageous to go to the open ocean and we could snorkeling. There are sea turtles and several fishes since the lagoon is fed by Ocean water. You also can rent aquatic toys, paddles, etc.The property is very well kept but I had the feeling that they did not want you to leave it. There are several restaurants in the property but the only one that was reasonable price and good to eat was the Italian one.If you stay in this hotel pay for the extra 5 dollars to have a vallet to park your car, since the parking lot is very far from the entrance of the hotel and it is convenient to just ask your car and drop it off in the entrance. It saved us tons of time.Overall it is a great hotel for family gatherings, there are a lot of pools, the lagoon but unfortunately there is no access to a white sand beach. The property offers a pathway along the rocks that goes to the ocean and in the back there is a little pathway that connect to the beach of the Marriott Hotel, but it is not an very easy hike since you need to walk over rocks in some points and it takes around 30 minutes to get there.I stayed there 4 days and every single day I saw whiles while I was walking in the pathway of the hotel, look out for them especially during sunrise and sunset! I got a picture of a full breach of a humpback it was spectacular! ", " lots to do and lots to see... great place for spending quality time with family! The service is excellent and kids love all the pools and slides... shopping centers are close by and so much to experience... ", " Although this place has been considered the \"Disneyland\" of the big island-being there as a couple I disagree. We were able to be alone the whole time we were there. There is an adults only pool (water VERY cold) and not hot tub-that was a BIG disappointment for an adult only area. We received an upgrade at check-in due to our HH status that gave us an ocean view. Our room was beautiful and newly remodeled. We stayed in the Palace tower which is centralized in the resort. We walked everywhere. We always missed the tram and never once rode the boat. They also have an extensive breakfast buffet which is expensive-we got 2 free each morning and there were two of us with or HH status. If you go with more than 2, it is very expensive.Our highlight was the lounge chairs they have scattered on the West shore of the resort to watch the sunset each night. Each night they blow a conch shell and run the perimeter of the resort lighting torches (*eye candy for women ). We spent most of our evenings there to be a couple and watch the sunset. Excellent resort - would definitely go back. Oh and I love the benefit of texting the front desk for needs or questions. Just make sure to leave your name and room number. ", " Highly recommend for your stay in the Big Island. I want to go back as soon as I can. The property is beautiful, clean, and inviting. All staff are helpful and friendly. Great variety of restaurants and shops, too. ", " We had a wonderful time at the Hilton resort. It is very beautiful. The staff was very friendly. The rooms are good, but the rest of the resort makes up for it. A bit pricey but worth it. The pools are great, and we got to see a few turtles in the Lagoon. ", " This resort is huge and set on the side of the island where there isn\u2019t much else except hotel resorts and time shares. They did have the Kings and Queens markets. Basically, small outdoor malls that had some chain restaurants and high-end shopping. There is a trolley that circles the hotels and shops all day, it\u2019s $2 a ride. The resort itself offers one big breakfast buffet spot, the food was good. I was impressed. They changed up several items each day as well. They have the basics of omelet, waffle and bread stations as well. For lunch, they have the lounge (the main bar) a cantina and a sandwich spot by the pool. They have 2 upscale, expensive restaurants for dinner but we did not dine there. The Yelp reviews were not great and for the amount of money, we chose to eat off the resort area.They have a dolphin area that you can pay to swim with them, but they don\u2019t perform shows. However, we would watch the morning feedings and checkups and they seemed to have fun playing with each other and their trainers. There is a lagoon area to swim in, this is the only ocean water in the area you can do that in. This area of the island does not have beaches to lay out on or swim in. You can walk down to the rocks and watch the sunset, which is gorgeous, but it\u2019s large rocks and lava chunks all around. You will have to go to another part of the island if you want to hang out on the beach or swim. The lagoon offers paddle boards, pedal boats, and snorkel gear to rent. There are sea turtles and fish everywhere you can look at. Next to the reefs, you can see the eels come out. The pool is huge with some massive waterfalls and a waterslide. The slide was fun for kids and adults!! The Legends of Hawaii Luau was awesome! The show\u2019s MC was entertaining and all the performances were fascinating, especially the fire shows at the end. The food was good and drinks a plenty. The staff was friendly everywhere we went. If you want to stay on a hotel resort, then this is the place to do it. However, be aware that you are 30-60 minutes away from anything to do off the resort. Everything else is on another part of the island. Everything on the resort was super pricey and cabs were expensive. Uber isn\u2019t readily available on the island yet. So, I suggest renting a car for your visit. Or, possibly finding a different hotel or Airbnb it to stay somewhere close to the locals on the island. ", " Love this resort! This was our 2nd visit . It is both kid and adult friendly. Beautiful suites, snorkel lagoon, golf course, spa, lots of shopping. Felt very pampered and will be back. View from our patio. ", " From check in to check out was quick. The Hilton complex is very big, for me it was fairly easy to get around. You either can walk (great excerise), take the Tram or Boat to different areas of the hotel. A nice selection of restaurants. ", " We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. The rooms or well-appointed in the park like atmosphere was fun for our entire family. Our children love riding the boats and trains throughout the property. The all-you-can-eat breakfast was amazing and a great deal ", " We have travel extensively both in the United States and throughout the world. This stay was truly exceptional. In fact it was among our top five stays at various hotels and other accommodations. In sum, my lady and I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to our next stay at this location. ", " This is my second stay at the Hilton Waikola Village property. I thoroughly enjoyed the property both times. I would not hesitate to make this property my home away from home when visiting Hawaii. you should go! ", " Second consecutive stay for us here. Both at Christmas time. Fantastic place, great people and fabulous staff. Particularly Maria Elena who checked us in and could not have been more helpful and kind to my whole family. Best service I've had in a long time and I am in hotels all the time, on business. Keep up the great work. Eckersley family. ", " This resort was so very beautiful. Lots of art, lovely gardens and two forms of transportation. The buffet breakfast was a little pricey, however this was part of my package offered by Costco and what a wonderful breakfast it was! The staff was very accommadating and kind. I will suggest this resort to everyone. Thank you so much! ", " Stayed at this resort with a large group of family for my daughter's wedding. What a beautiful resort! Had such a wonderful stay. Great amenities and attentive staff who took great care of everyone in our party. ", " I had a very enjoyable stay at this resort. It is beautifully landscaped with trees, native plants and flowers. There was water everywhere. Kelly at the front desk was very helpful. She took the time to make sure I understood everything about the hotel and answered all of my questions. My room was in the ocean tower and quite far from the main lobby but the hotel has a tram that runs at regular intervals to take you to your building. They also offer a boat to take you around the resort. My room was clean and very welcoming. Had a view of the golf course (not ideal) but it was ok. Didn't spend much time in my room anyway. There were waterfalls outside my door.There are pools at nearly every building on the property and guests can use any of them. But the salt water lagoon is where you want to spend your time. It is filled with water from the ocean, so many sea creatures make their way into it. Got to see a sea turtle. There is ample beach space with lounge chairs, umbrellas and cabanas. The hotel sits on the ocean but does not have beach access. You have to leave the resort to get to the beach. Downside is parking is $27/day, no microwave in room and no beach access. But these things are small compared to how beautiful the resort is. I recommend taking the walking trails around the resort. The shore trail is beautiful and you can sit for hours watching the water. There are hallways that lead from one end of the resort to the other (if you don't want to wait for train or boat). This is worth the walk. The hallways are decorated with the most beautiful art. It is like walking through a museum.I really enjoyed watching the dolphins play games with their ball. They looked happy and like they were having a lot of fun.Everyone on staff at the hotel was great. They always said hello and were willing to help you with any questions you have. I am often recognized as a Hilton Honors Gold member but at this resort, I was treated like one. Mahalo! ", " very accommodating and welcoming. spacious clean rooms. very friendly staff. very beautiful grounds and scenery. plety of activities to keep you busy and happy. a place where dreams are made and remembered. ", " I'll start by saying that the resort is completely gorgeous. No matter where you look, you're looking at something magnificent. Whether it be the views of the fresh blue ocean, the lagoon that is encompassed by the resort, fed from the ocean, or even the pieces along the museum walkway, the Hilton Waikoloa is at it's base form, amazing.As you walk in, you can expect to be greeted by smiles from the staff who are glad to help you in any way they can. This attitude remains the same throughout your entire stay: there's always a friendly face to help you.I stayed in the Palace Tower. The room was spacious, and generally really quite comfortable. The housekeeping and maintenance services were both excellent. I can not fault the room.The convention centre was a little leaky, but that's not their fault, and they did everything they could to rectify the issues.This hotel is a place to relax and take some time to do nothing. If you want something to do, the best option is to go off resort, which is easy and cheap. Car rental from the on-site alamo is just $52 a day for a mid-size.I didn't try too much of the food on the resort, but the breakfast is really quite good, in particular the fruits. I can also recommend the Lagoon Grill for something cheap. There are a number of good restaurants just down the road at Queen's Marketplace.One thing I will say against this hotel is that nothing is cheap. But this is the case in the whole area, and you can argue that there is pretty good value for the amount you pay for things.I'd come back here. ", " This is one of the best resorts on the island. Excellent staff, great activities and amazing food. They have their own ocean fed lagoon which is very safe for kids and full natural sea life. They also have several pools with water slides and other activities. Make sure you come and visit if you are on the Big Island. Conveniently located to shopping centers and public beach. ", " This is the Disneyland for kids and adults. You will never get bored with the selection of luxury pools, restaurants, entertainment choices and stunning landscape and design. My very large rom with a view was super comfortable (best beds ever) however; it really needs new carpet and updating. There are alot of birds here and the sounds of all of the birds and the waves are so peaceful.Never get bored. This place has everything and the attention to detail is amazing! ", " We stayed at this hotel 10 years ago for our honeymoon. We always wanted to come back and finally got the chance. We couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate! Our room was large and had a beautiful view. The resort is centrally located so we can reach all parts of the island. The Big Island Breakfast started our day off on the right foot. Yes, the resort is large (62 acres) but you can easily get around using the trams or boats. We have only been back 1 day and are already missing it! Mahalo for a great trip! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a wonderful place to stay. There's several pools throughout the resort, a huge water slide, a lagoon where you can paddle board with sea turtles, and a dolphin enclosure where you can interact with the dolphins. My ten year old loves the breakfast buffet, and we always make reservations at Kamuela Provincial Company for dinner overlooking the ocean at sunset. You don't ever have to leave the resort. ", " The hotel is perfect for a family stay during the vacation. Ocean tower has nice view and lagoon tower has better location. Kids enjoy the train and boat service very much. Definitely, I will be back in future. ", " Great resort. There's lots of restaurants to fit everyone's budget. Loved the tram and the boat to get around the resort. Enjoyed the hammock and lounge chairs near the Buddha statue. Great place to relax. The pool was very cold, but the water slide was still a lot of fun. Overall, a great experience! ", " What a fantastic place. Let me start with the not so hot. We were greeted with a sales pitch to upgrade our room to the Makai rooms, which were closer to the gym and main pool. At first the price was $40 upgrade and then after we declined, it went down to $30. Why do I need to upgrade to be closer to the pool. (the other rooms were quite a distance so we took the bait. Once we got past that, the hotel was fantastic. I can see why they have a train and boat to get people around the hotel. The pool was fantastic and the cabanas were easy to get (they were reserved for Makai guests). My favorite part of the hotel was the lagoon. When I saw there were fish and turtles, I was thinking regular fish and those small turtles you, but I was so wrong. Wonderful jumping fish, colorful fish and large green sea turtles. We swam with them everyday and it was so incredible. Tip: get out there early before everyone destroys the visibility, which is not all that great to start with. The staff were wonderful and our room was clean and very quiet. It is in a great location with the Queen and King malls not too far. ", " My wife and I spent a week at an affiliated Hilton property (King's Land) and had the opportunity to spend some time at nearby Waikoloa Village. As a matter of fact we ended up spending a great deal of time there and flat out fell in love with the place. The facility is magnificent with miles of walkways surrounded by fantastic views of the ocean, lagoons, a multitude of pools, and resident turtles and dolphins. Strolling the paths amid such beauty was very relaxing with many interesting areas to sit, relax, and take in the views. Bars and casual restaurants were never very far away and every member of the staff was warm, friendly, and extremely helpful. Although there were many, one of the highlights was dining at KPC on a patio table while watching the sunset. The food was delicious, well presented and service flawless. As a matter of fact I have never experienced a friendlier more helpful staff than the people at the entire Waikoloa Village. From the warmth of Chef Hans, the bartenders, valets, and even the service staff everyone seemed focused on making us feel special and welcome. Here is just one example; we had just missed the resort shuttle and decided to walk back to Kings Land but just a few blocks down the road an employee in a golf cart rolled up, asked where we were headed and said hop in. He took us right to our door and refused any offer for gratuity. It is really a tribute to the management here that the entire staff, top to bottom has bought in to such a high level of accommodation and service. Our stay was fantastic without a single hiccup or complaint and I am already devising a way to return to this vacation paradise. ", " We love this place. This is our goto place when traveling to Kona, HI. The pools, lagoon and all of the service and food are all great. Definitely a fun way to enjoy the island, and if you just want to stay put and relax. ", " We stayed here in the condos for our family reunion, well designed, big downstairs, on the golf course, great pool, all the furniture and decor were top notch. And of course the many amenities on the hotel grounds were superb which was included in our condo fee. ", " We absolutely loved this place. We decided on a Friday to go to Hawaii and jumped on a plane on Monday from NY. The resort is huge and beatifically landscaped. 62 acres is more than you can image and you must use the monorail and the boat systems to see everything. I did found it much much more expensive than Oahu and Maui but I also never left this resort during the stay. The pools and lagoon are beautiful and I would probably return with better planning, last minute trips are expensive. The rooms are not newly renovated, however, I found the size to be comfortable. The island excursions are extremely expensive therefore try to enjoy the resort because there's plenty to do. Staff is very friendly. The kid's show called Paradise Run is filmed here in early Spring; you'll share the amenities with them and the film crew. ", " Amazing resort experience. Tram between buildings was very convenient. Outstanding service by the friendly staff. Great luau entertainment. Amazing art collection housed in the covered pedestrian walkways.Could use more opportunities to hear live music and to dance. Spa was nice and clean. Shops had a nice variety. The boat that travels between venues should operate more hours per day. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is the place to be if you want downtime to relax/rejuvenate or if you're looking for action/adventure. Exceptional service, beautiful property and multiple activity options. Great for friends just having fun, couples looking for romance and families making memories. ", " Wonderful property for a family vacation. Property is so beautiful - a joy just to walk from one area to the other. Highly recommend to all to make a visit at any time. IN addition to a great resort, the Big Island is a real treat. Many, many wonderful day trips that are great fun and really are once in a lifetime opportunities. Make sure to include this hotel on your wish list. ", " Loving our room in the ocean tower. Huge walk in closet and bathroom a bonus. Rented cabanas at the Kona pool. Excited for dinner tonight at the queens marketplace. Everyone on property has been very helpful. Kids love the tram. It's a huge property. Be prepared to walk or use on property boats or tram. ", " I have loved this property since I first stayed there ten years ago. It didn't disappoint this time either. Great property for families as it has a protected lagoon full of fish and turtles to snorkel, swim and play in. Beautiful pools with slides and interesting animals dot the property.This property is a bit remote, so a car is necessary and I could see if you didn't have kids that it might not be a great choice. But other than the high food and parking prices, these are the only drawbacks. ", " This resort was beautiful and relaxing, it's perfect for families or a romantic getaway with the best views of sunset on the beach. This resort is filled with lots of art and sculptures all around this hotel. We stayed in the newly renovated palace tower and it was beautiful. KPC is perfect for a romantic sunset dinner out on their lanai. We will definitely return to paradise at Hilton Waikoloa ", " This is the 4th time I have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa and it won't be the last! I've been 3 times in the Ocean Towers and this last trip in the Palace (WOW!! 7th floor, ocean view...doesn't get much better than this! However, my goal is to stay in the Lagune Tower!!). Anyway, this is one of those incredible resorts that you could stay and never go off premises...or go anywhere on the island from here. The Concierge staff will help you with any ideas and adventures you would like to pursue. Having the Queen's Marketplace and the King's Market within walking distance is great. And did I mention how much fun it is to strike off on the trails that surround the resort. My favorite is going South across the lava fields (the path right before the Queen's Marketplace) to the road that takes you into Lava Lava Beach and then follow the ocean trail back to the resort. It's less than 4 miles and always beautiful. Food is great, the KPC is one of my favorites for just the gorgeous views! And if you're with a special person in your life, consider getting the couples massage up on the cliff overlooking the ocean...truly memorable! Did that years ago and will return again for that!! ", " If you are going to the Big Island of Hawaii, the Hilton Waikoloa is the place to stay. From check in to check out this property and it's staff gives you the \"aloha\" spirt. As I checked in, the front end associate (Samantha) was so genuinely pleasant and made sure all my needs were addressed. She really took the time to give me the lay of the huge property and helped expedite my check in process. From that point on every other associate I met, greeted me with an \"Aloha\" and again made me feel completely welcomed. I got up early every morning and the Hilton has an army of staff members cleaning and polishing every corner of the property. It was obvious the grounds do not look so pristine by accident. The property itself is spectacular! They have the lagoon, with turtles, fish, and eels just steps away. Plenty of waterfalls and slides for kids (and of course for the kid in all of us). By this point you should get my point, the property rocks! Thank you to the staff and management of the Hilton Waikoloa. My hats off the the general manager David Givens. The aloha spirt is alive and well at the Hilton Waikoloa. ALOHA! ", " Amazing hotel and very large operation with over 1,200 rooms. We got a larger room at the Palace Tower with a balcony and great views to the ocean. This building is also renovated recently and rooms are very nice and very clean. The resort is very spread out and connects all buildings, pools and restaurants by a monorail and a boat. The boat though is slow and just nice to relax. The monorail is very efficient and each stations have an info screen (like the subway) informing you of the waiting time. The pools are great and particularly very suitable for families and some have great slides for the kids. The tennis Center, located near the Spa, offers great lessons for children and their Pro Liane is very professional and knowledgeable. She puts in a lot of energy and joy in teaching children which I have not seen before from a Pro. The staff at the valet is very friendly and the system is efficient, worth you pay the daily US$30 fee vs the US$25 for self parking. Breakfast is all in one outlet and can be very busy with some queues, so better get up early. Food is abundant and good, same is the service, friendly and very polite. It has a large variety of other outlets such as Japanese, Italian, American and Mexican. A must is to enjoy the sunsets at Kamuela outlet with great views, good service and very good food. 3 days a week the hotel puts a Hawaiian show together in an outdoor stage which host up to over 500 guests on a nice buffet. The dancers, singer and musicians are really good and authentic. The highlight is the Dolphin experience and must do in this resort. It has 11 dolphins and you can book and swim with them. For children there is a nice marine education center where they do teach them about these amazing smart animals before they go to the water in the hotel lagoon. They take nice pictures and videos. A life time experience! Overall a very well managed resort with very friendly staff and make your holiday absolutely great and easy! ", " Was a great stay, food, fun. No microwaves in the rooms. Lots to do with children. Lots to do period. Easy car rental at resort and helpful peogle everywhere there. Would stay again. Super clean! Numerous pools and the lagoon area was amazing! Fun watching/swimming with turtles and all kinds of fish. ", " This resort is nothing short of being absolutely STUNNING!! The property is loaded with beautiful pieces of art so inside and out is just beautiful! Our room was very large and comfortable. You can take a boat or the tram right from the lobby to your room! My only complaint was their food prices so we ate off site. ", " This hotel is awesome. It is a true resort!! You never have to leave the place.Nothing is too far away on the site. A train and a boat are part of the experience!!!The setting is beautiful!!! The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. Everyone wanted to make sure that we were pleased and having a good time. ", " My best friend and I vacationed here and the place is amazing! We are two single ladies and most of the guests were couples and/or families. But we made the best of it and enjoyed relaxing, the quietness and we just chilled. ", " Wife and I stayed 11 nights with ocean view in the Makai Lagoon tower. We were able to watch the dolphins and some turtles from our room. The resort is huge. The tram and boat will take you from one end to the other. Ate at every place in the resort, food and staff are great. Booked through Costco, so resort fees and our buffet breakfast were included every day. ", " We booked 6 nights in the Ocean Tower and had a fantastic time and room. The room was a bit dated as some people have said but it was clean and furnished well. We liked the room the view from our balcony was breathtaking. The pools are very nice. A lot of people complain about the walking, the rooms, the food but we have no complaints at all except one, we should have booked 10 days instead of 6 days. The breakfast is fantastic, a bit expensive if not included so I would suggest you get a package that includes the breakfast. The staff was great. The KPC restaurant is fantastic, it is a bit expensive but go at least one time when you are there you will not be disappointed. Go at sunset with a table on the lanai for a beautiful view. We both had the Ginger Infused Steamed Monchong it is an excellent entree. The property is spread-out but we like to walk and used the tram and boat very little. We can hardly wait to go again. The big island is a bit more quiet and relaxing which is a plus for us. ", " We loved this hotel, we stayed in Makai @ Lagoon Tower, with an ocean view. I can't find a bad thing to say about this hotel. All the staff were excellent, helpful & polite, not like some you can get in Australia. We loved the walking we could do around the resort & I know some people have complained about the size of the resort & the walk to their rooms but honestly there was a train or boat to get you around, what more could you want. All the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Our room was lovely and the view was beautiful. We loved the big island so much would not hesitate to return and would of course return to the Hilton. Absolutely loved it. ", " Overall, the Hilton Waikoloa Village is an awesome hotel. Amazing grounds with tremendous services. Excellent gym, spa, restaurants, pools, tennis and golf. Everything you need for an great vacation. Beautiful views with a strong emphasis on supporting the environment and local wildlife. The dolphins are spectacular! And, if you have kids, lots of activities for them. Outstanding! ", " Of all the years of my traveling I have never seen a boat and /or tram take you to your room. That met both were pretty impressive one ride from one side to the other is about 26 mins on the boat. 9 mins with the tram 7 mins walk from palace tower to breakfast building. 1/4 mile to the self parking lot Only 5$ difference so valet is worth it by the End of the trip you will want more time here.. shark feeding is every other day at 1130am !Maloha_ ", " This is an incredible location. So beautiful! So much to do for all ages. Staff so helpful for people with mobility issues. Food and service exceptional. This is not just a hotel it was a full service resort. I would suggest this place to everyone! ", " The service, amenities and location of this hotel could not be any better. If you want to spend the best vacation with your family in Hawaii, this is the hotel to be. Staff is friendly and the Makai experience is the best. ", " Having never been to Hawaii before, the HWV was the first of three resorts on our 11-day schedule. What a fantastic way to start the trip!This resort is wonderful in every way, perfect especially for families and golfers. Highly recommend! ", " The grounds are beautiful. Staff helpful and friendly. Room is nothing special-just a typical hotel room. There is a tram for transport within the grounds if someone in the party has walking issues, but there are LOTS of steps. My room rate was part of a package, but the hotel is pricey. We had a great breakfast included in our package-beautiful buffet everyday. Pillows were odd-really thick and required adjusting to avoid headache. ", " Great for Families. The dinning was very good. The service was excellent. Many of the employees have worked there for many years and enjoy what they do and they care about your stay. Many local beaches are a short drive away. I would recommend a stay here for anyone who is looking to relax in Hawaii! ", " Been to Kona 4x and stay at Hilton and Hyatt around the world and like the resort very much. Best thing is the lagoon pool. Great views everywhere. Negatives were inconsiderate smokers and weekend warriors overtaking some pool areas by jumping into the water from very high up on the waterfalls. ", " My husband and I were staying at a nearby hotel on our honeymoon. Lots of friends had recommended this hotel and we decided to walk over and check it out. We are so impressed that we decided to stay for a night just to experience all of the amenities, specifically the gorgeous lagoon fed straight from the ocean!We booked the least expensive room, but when we returned the next day check in, we'd been upgraded to the nicest tower. We received free movie rentals (there was a PlayStation in the room!) and bracelets that got us a discount on everything at the resort. The little restaurant overlooking the dolphin pool was by far our favorite place. We are there two days in a row!The only bummer is that pretty much everywhere (on the island, not just this resort) closes at 9, so make sure you grab a bottle of wine at the grocery store for you night owls!The rooms were updated and luxurious. Truly a fabulous experience! ", " Coming into our stay, I had read a lot of negative reviews on TripAdvisor from other patrons which left us a bit nervous. I have to say none of the things I read about were part of our experience. Hilton waikoloa treated their honors members like royalty. We were given water bottles upon our arrival as well as free breakfast daily (excluding tip), which was fabulous! Mike over in tours and activities was also wonderful, he directed us to a timeshare presentation (we did not buy) but were given a holo holo card which provides significant discounts on tours. This is a must!!!! Tolerate the presentation for 90 minutes and you will be granted a whirlwind of savings and Hilton cash. We put the cash toward the luau which is wonderful! Open bar buffet food and from what I saw a kids menu. Luau was so much fun and totally worth it. One thing I would caution patrons on is that quite a few of the tours will not pick up and we did not want the expense of renting a car for obvious reasons. The ones we used that did pick up:Wasabi toursIruka ocean experienceOcean sportsYou should be able to do everything you desire with those three companies to avoid the car rental. We also discovered a bit too late that there is a bus to hilo for super cheap. The KPC restaurant was excellent but we did not enjoy the food at the Italian restaurant on site. Yes food is expensive but this is hawaii. The Italian restaurant was not good though so not worth the money. The pasta was so covered in parsley it was almost inedible. Go over to the lava lava beach club between 3-5 for a cheap food menu and 3 dollar beers. There is a beach trail right back to the hotel. Our room was super nice clean and comfortable! Thank you Hilton for a memorable vacation! ", " Great Hilton property with an outstanding breakfast. Totally enjoyable and great for relaxing. Also, excellent opportunity to see a somewhat active volcano in the national park. Plenty of pools, a beach, and water toys. ", " One of the most beautiful resorts on Hawaii Island! We enjoyed every minute of our stay! From the moment we arrived until we checked out each and everyone one of the staff treated us with pure aloha! Which made our stay that much more memorable! We will definitely be staying at the Hilton way more often. ", " Stacy and Scot at KPC were exceptional. Service in the hotel was excellent. Beautiful location. Pool water was cold but that cannot be helped. Pool area were very well kept and towels were always available. Only complaint was that one our favorites restaurant ws the Boat Landing and that closed at 3 pm. Loved sitting here at night and having a light dinner and listening to the music. Would have also liked a cuisne other than Mexican also available. ", " We live the Hilton Waikoloa Village. We have been coming here for years and our family will come back for many more. Always clean and in beautiful shape. The staff and dinning is always great!! The lagoon and pools with water slides make it hard to leave and venture out. Great family and honeymoon resort. We have been for both. ", " It's was our 1st time staying at the Hilton Waikoloa and the Kona end of Hawai'i Island. We was Celebrating our 28th Anniversary and my husbands 53rd Birthday! Great place for a Get-A-Way that we'll be back! ", " Excellent all around property! We were greeted there at the desk by Kelly who was excellent! She upgraded us to the Lagoon Tower and was very hospitable and accommodating especially bc me and my wife are both Hilton employees. We had a beautiful room overlooking the dolphin pool. We were greeted and walked to our room by a gentleman named Addis. He was excellent! He explained all of our Makai benefits and was very informative about the property overall. Our first night we dined at KPC. The hostess there was Esther who was so nice and got us a beautiful and special table bc it was our honeymoon. While we waited for our table to be ready we had 2 excellent bartenders named Rayna and Irene serve us cocktails and small talk with us. They were awesome! Once we sat we were taken care of by Keith who was on point with everything from menu knowledge to good service. The next morning we had breakfast at The Water's Edge where we were again warmly greeted by Esther followed by a terrific breakfast. Our only day at the pool we were taken care of at the bar by Brandon and Shelley who were both very friendly. They did a terrific job taking care of our needs throughout our pool day. Throughout our stay we were taken care of on more than one occasion by Jerry at the Makai concierge desk. He was very helpful and knowledgeable about the island. He helped us book a helicopter tour and a couple of other adventures. On our last day we decided to ask for a late checkout due to a late flight out and again our friend Kelly at the front desk came through for us. She was such a delight both times we dealt with her. After we checked out we went to the spa to finish out our vacation. Judy and Fran were awesome and helped us to enjoy our last moments in Hawaii on our honeymoon. Overall we loved our stay here. We would recommend this property to anyone for any occasion. ", " This resort is amazing. There is so much to do and see you could easily spend two weeks here. We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on our honeymoon and the resort was perfect for relaxation, but there was so many activities on offer also (swimming, snorkelling, paddle board, golf, tennis just to name a few). The vibe of the resort is so laid back, prefect for couples and families alike. The location of the resort is so close to amazing shopping and also beautiful white and black sand beaches including Hapuna Beach, Beach 49 and Beach 69. Cannot wait to return as the 5 nights we stayed was no where near long enough. ", " Best place to stay. This was our second time staying st the Hilton Waikoloa. The property has just about everything you would need. The pools are kid and adult friendly. Food was good. We will be back! ", " Lots of nice pools to choose from. There is a monorail to take you from one side to the other as well as a boat you can hop on and off depending on where you want to go. Nice restaurants on-site and lots of things to do like swim with the dolphins. The beaches in from the of the resort are a little rocky, but if you go up the coast a short way (maybe 2 to 3 miles) there is a nice sandy beach where you can spend some time if you want to get on the beach instead of lounging around the pools. This is my favorite Hilton property so far. ", " So an American Express offer and a good cheap flight brought my wife and I back to Hawaii for a second visit to paradise. We returned to the Hilton at Waikoloa village and this time stayed in the main hotel's palace tower whereas before we were in the King's land section of this extensive property. It was fantastic being in the main hotel area with access to the amazing grounds, pools, restaurants, and inspirational views. The room was large, beautifully maintained, with amazing views of both the ocean and golf course. The obviously well trained staff was friendly and went out of their way to please at every opportunity. We rented a reasonably priced poolside cabana for the day that came with a safe for valuables, an ice chest with complimentary bottled water, and very attentive service. Lying on a comfortable lounge chair with ice cold drinks in that setting was incredibly relaxing. During the course of the day we were given cold towels and popsicles to feel truly pampered. Nearby in the main lagoon there is a wide variety of recreational equipment available for rental at reasonable rates. We enjoyed paddling around watching the sea turtles glide below us. The resort has some very nice restaurant options with a variety of food available. Located in a very romantic spot right on the ocean we had an extremely memorable meal at KPC. Food and service were impeccable as we dined at a patio table, watching the sunset while a runner ran past lighting the multitude of pathway torches across the property. Waikoloa Village has everything you could want for a memorable, pampered, and satisfying vacation. It is truly a slice of paradise that my wife and I cannot wait to return to. ", " Went for our honeymoon and stayed for 9 days at the resort and was extremely impressed with the atmosphere and the upkeep of the grounds. The restaurants were quite pricey but on the days we did eat there, the food was very good. There are other places near by to eat as well as grocery stores. The wait staff and bartenders, Peter and Joanna, at the Kohala pool bar were also very friendly. We stayed in the ocean tower and did have a nice but limited view of the ocean front (granted being from the Midwest, any view is a good one). The resort itself is very large with many different activities to do and a lot of beautiful sights to see. Many different paths for walking/running, plenty of different places to swim, the halls are a museum of history of different cultures and the landscape is gorgeous. ", " Fun time. Really liked the lagoon for our 3 year old daughter. Calm water, lots of activities, lots of ocean life to see as well. I liked that it was walking distance to ABay. The grounds are beautiful and the boat and tram are a plus for getting around. ", " This is our second time staying at the Hilton.Friendly helpful staff! Plenty to do if you don't want to leave weather a couple with or without kids or with a group of people no matter the age.We booked through Costco and the breakfast buffet was included and that was a good thing. Even though it's a great buffet with a great staff and food it's 30 dollars per person. Rooms are nice. We stayed in the palace tower and it's newly renovated.Hotel is close to Kona with plenty of things to see and do.Beautiful place to stay with art work everywhere and a lagoon to swim in. Its ocean water that comes into the pool via the tide so plenty of ocean life to view while snorkeling. ", " This was our third stay at this resort and it was great as usual. The resort is very large and accommodating, if you don't want to leave the resort you really don't have to. They have two great restaurants, KPC and Imari. We went to both 5 times each and every time was a great experience. They are on the more expensive end but the quality and atmosphere is well worth it. The view from KPC is breathtaking. We did not go to the Italian restaurant which is the third restaurant on the property because of mixed reviews so I cannot comment on the quality there. There is also a \"grill\" that serves burgers and other items like that. They have the Orchid Marketplace which also has food and an ice cream shack. The breakfast buffet was included in our trip as well and it was an amazing selection everyday. They had some staple items that were offered everyday and then they also had ones change daily so it didn't get old. They have an omelet station that is included if you do the buffet and that is excellent! The staff on the resort are very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. They have a safe lagoon where you can do paddle boarding, snorkeling, paddle boats, etc in. The have a small variety of fish swimming around, sea turtles and eels although the water is a little cloudy for good snorkeling. They have the Dolphin Quest where people can swim with the dolphins but it's in an open area for all to see so you can enjoy them without paying for that activity. They also have two small black tip reef sharks in a secure area that you can view which is close to the grill by the dolphin exhibit. They have numerous pools and hot tubs so there is plenty of room for everyone, they even have an adults only pool down by the Ocean Tower. We have stayed at the Ocean Tower and the Lagoon Tower, they also have the Palace Tower but we've never stayed in that one. We liked both towers but prefer the Lagoon Tower, probably because it's closer to the main lobby, we had amazing views and the areas we liked the most. They have DVD kiosks in each tower that you can rent movies from for free which is nice because they have a great selection which also includes many new releases. We've been here on a couples trip and a family trip with our kids and the resort is great for both. There are many nice paths and areas to go on walks that have amazing views. They do a complimentary photo shoot for all the guests that comes with one complimentary 4x6 picture. Overall excellent trip and will go again! ", " Admittedly, I did not comprehend the size of the resort prior to arrival or from the web.Very well designed resort with 3 ways of getting around, monorail, boat or by walking. Each way had its own attraction. Monorail for ease and airconditioning, boat although infrequent but once on, it gave a different perception of the resort. Walking would have been long and boring if not for the art museum along the walkway. Well designed. Upgraded to Palace tower. Room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast buffet filled us up well before a day of either cycling, stand up paddling and snorkeling. Often was not hungry until late afternoon. Facilities were sufficient. Paid more for the convenience of stand up paddle rental in the resort which was fine for an hour. Free DVD rental was handy in the evenings after dinner. Had dinners out of the resort which were only a couple of minutes drive. Suited us well as we like to get out at times during our 3 night stay. ", " My wife & I stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights in October 2016. The resort quickly became her favorite lodging experience ever, primarily for the grounds & the views from our 5th story lanai in the Makai at Lagoon Tower. The resort is beautiful & serene & every corner you turn evokes the word \"Hawaii\" from your expectations before you arrived.Our room was spacious & very comfortable (including the king bed), and the bathroom facilities were well laid out & maintained (his & her sinks, large shower stall with adjacent toilet). Plenty of personal storage space in the form of a large closet with an automatic light & lots of drawers around the room. The entry door could have used a bit more sound deadening to muffle the noise from the space in the middle of the Lagoon Tower complex, which included a nightly serenade by hundreds of perching birds. The lanai was large enough for two guests, and the view of the swimming lagoon & adjacent dolphin training area & the ocean beyond was spectacular. We were also able to watch the sunrise over Mauna Kea from there, and we could see the observatories on the top.The Hilton Waikoloa bell/parking staff & front desk personnel & housekeepers & restaurant personnel & groundskeepers were all very friendly and genuine and helpful. The only service-related complaint was that I had to stand at the front desk for 10 minutes waiting for one of the clerks to finish a check-in before I could get new room keys to replace the malfunctioning ones we were given on arrival. Otherwise, the hotel staff service was outstanding. The facilities (on-site transportation, restaurants, shops, swimming lagoon & multiple pools, guest service centers) were all top notch. The on-site luau was a first-rate dining & entertainment event; we recommend you pay the up-charge for the \"Ali'i seating\" to get good view of the entertainment as well as an early go at the buffet line. The breakfast buffets were amazingly varied & delicious, with attentive service & constant refreshing of items. The only other restaurants we visited on the property were the Lagoon Grill (good food, great service) and Dona & Toni's Pizza (fair to middlin' pizza with good service). For on-resort destinations that you don't feel like walking to, there is a very convenient schedule of electric trams that run end-to-end for extended hours. We'd also recommend at least one round-trip ride on a canal boat, either your first day to familiarize yourself with the resort or a nighttime ride for a pleasant after-dinner cruise.We strongly recommend paying the few extra bucks per day for valet parking. The walk to/from your car can be very long. You can call the valet station before you leave your room, give them your ticket number, and have your car waiting right outside the lobby when you get down there. One more bonus opportunity that we took advantage of on-site: Getting in the water with the Dolphin Quest staff & the dolphins. This is an extra expense that may not fit too comfortably in your budget, but it's worth serious consideration (and changing a few other expensive activities) to gain an experience you can't get in just any vacation destination.We were very pleased with our stay at Hilton Waikoloa Village, and would definitely book a Lagoon Tower room if we returned to The Big Island again. It was a very memorable & relaxing stay. ", " Went two times. Both times I struggled to find something to complain about, could not find anything.At my second stay I got a room that was very noisy as it was located in the Ocean Tower very near a service area. Went to the front desk, asked if they could relocate me to a quieter room and in 10 minutes I was relaxing in a much better room.The pools, the gardens, the shoreline, the grass, the bars, the art gallery, the views, the night views, the BED, the ENTIRE PLACE is out of this world. The most difficult decision I had to face everyday was either to stay the whole day there swimming like a whale on those amazing pools or couch-potatoing on a hammock OR go out and explore the island.If I could go every year to the Big Island, I would stay every year at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, I don't care if there are better hotels. I found my place. ", " Awesome lagoon (has a lot of giant sea turtles and numerous beautiful fish; paddleboard, kayaking, etc). My kids (10 & 5) loved DolphinQuest (it's a MUST DO). Views are very beautiful. Recreation areas are very comfortable. Don't miss out on the culture classes. My kids loved them. Lots and lots to do here. Staff is fantastic and responsive. You won't be disappointed. My only irritation is the \"resort fee\". I wish they'd just add that crap in when I pay for the reservation. ", " This was our 2nd trip to the Big Island of Hawaii. The first time we only stayed here 3 days. This time we stayed the whole week, I would recommend this as it is much better to enjoy the resort AND have time to get out to enjoy island excursions. Just so you know, this resort is not only beautiful, but it is also huge (fourth largest hotel in Hawaii). There are trains and boats to help you get from one side to another, otherwise expect a lot of walking.Everybody there (staff & management) was very friendly, informative, and accommodating. Right from the start, manager Alessandra fixed our reservation to the correct week (accidentally booked flight, car, and excursions for the week BEFORE), when corporate said they could not change it. Upon arrival, Kriztine\u2019s smiling face checked us in and gave us lots of helpful information.The pools, waterfalls, waterslide, and it\u2019s own private lagoon are all immaculate. The lagoon is great for paddleboarding and snorkeling (lots of cool fish and a few turtles). The lagoon leads to an area with a couple of sharks and an area for the Dolphin Quest with 5-6 dolphins (and a baby). I recommend booking a dolphin experience to get into the water with them . And of course, the restaurants, bars, and food are amazing. Sweet Esther greeted us every morning at Big Island Breakfast, seating us right by the windows overlooking the lagoon. During the day, while enjoying all the pools, the best bar to go to is the Kona Pool bar. Bartenders Brandon and Brian make wonderfull generous cocktails\u2026 and out of hundreds of patrons, they always remembered our drink of choice and room number. We had an excellent teppanyaki style dinner at the Japanese restaurant, Imari. Donna & Toni\u2019s was a great Italian restaurant, Marymalane was so nice and funny, she sat us with handsome Gabriel who served us (and provided PLENTY of wine). But our favorite restaurant by far was Kamuela Provision Company (KPC). So good, we went twice! The food was incredible, and Linda and Brandon were amazing servers. Christian (the aspiring cop) was awesome! He hooked us up at KPC a second night with a VIP table right by the ocean in perfect view of the gorgeous sunset.For this trip, we took advantage of a rare all-inclusive special rate for our stay (included breakfast, drinks, and dinners) and we expected to be treated as less of a customer, BOY were we wrong! Everybody was incredibly nice, gave us upgrades (seated us right up front at the Luau) and just made us feel like kings. Kings in Paradise! ", " We stayed 6 nights and had an amazing time at the hotel. It is a very big property but everyone can use some exercise and the views are worth the walk. It is a very family friendly location my son loves riding the boat to the room. Food is expensive on site there are some option in the shopping area and others not far from the hotel if you want to drive. The hotel has lots of options hope to got back again some day. ", " We stayed here for three nights at the end of our trip in one of the recently renovated Hale Ike rooms in the Palace Tower. The room was great - really spacious, and we had a great view of the ocean (even though it was a \"partial\" ocean view. We could watch the sunset from our lanai each night. We love the design of the resort, including all of the artwork and artifacts that are spread out throughout the grounds. The Kona pool and lagoon are both great.The best \"extra\" that we paid for was a cabana rental one day when we went to the lagoon. It was great having the extra shade and comfy chairs.. It comes with towel service and ice water, and a server from the Lagoon grill comes over to take food and drink orders (which cost extra). It was so relaxing and I wish I had done it every day while we were there.My only major disappointment was that I had requested a late checkout before we got there but weren't able to get one.Know what to expect before you go: valet parking is $30/day and the resort fee adds another $30/day. Food and drinks are pricey so plan ahead. ", " bay club waiakola was very nice. it was a gift form our kids for one week. nice swimming pools and beautiful sunsets at the pool bar. cocktails at happy hour are half off with different nightly Hawaiian specials. ", " Our first time in Hawaii and we had a great time at the Hilton Waikola. The room was clean and comfortable and the premises were well maintained and beautiful. The best part was the saltwater lagoon where you can snorkel and swim with lots of tropical fish and the odd sea turtle. ", " We celebrated our Sales President's Club this last spring at the Hilton Waikaloa property. Our stay there was extra special because of Nick Seidle's support during our stay. He not only helped us with the right type of rooms, but he made sure that every activity was coordinated to be meaningful for our sales reps and their spouses. He was tremendous, and represented that property so well always going above and beyond our expectations. ", " I have went to Hilton Waikoloa Village several years ago on a family trip and I absolutely loved it! I just got married and when we were deciding where to go on our honeymoon I really wanted to come back to Hawaii. I was so excited to return to Hilton Waikoloa Village! We just got back and we had a wonderful time! We loved laying by the beach and pool. Our suite was breathtaking and we hope on day to return! ", " We were looking for a resort stay with our toddler where we could relax, play in the pool and salt water, and not feel the need to leave the resort. We purchased the all inclusive deal earlier this year and had a great stay and experience at this hotel. Very kid friendly and accommodating. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village was an exceptional experience & the staff was very helpful & polite & my wife & I had one of the best vacations we have ever taken & would recommend this resort. The staff was exceptional and the place was an absolute blast. ", " We stayed in the Ocean Tower. I wish I had a better view of the mountain and/or ocean. The rooms were clean and the service was exceptional. This is easily the best Hilton location I've visited. The big island is really a throw back to a time when locals were genuinely happy to see tourists. ", " We stayed here for our honey moon last year and had the best time! This is not a resort, but a village - it is huge! We couldn't fault it. We spent most the time walking around the resort to the numerous bars, restaurants and checking out the dolphins! We would definitely come back to this place if we were planning to stay on the Big Island again. ", " This is a resort in the luxury class that delivers. With a 22,000 sq foot pool what's not to like. The facility has a residential feel to it (home away from home) and a superb headquarters for travel and exploration. Like any place keep an eye out for a great rate and then spoil yourself. frome family (that's my perspective when writing) to getaways for couples this place will not disappoint. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable and are forthcoming regarding \"local knowledge\" must do's. ", " Beautiful resort with gorgeous ocean views. Highly recommend. Be prepared to walk as it is a large resort. They do have a tram and gondola but those can be slow. On site coffee shops are wonderful. Do your shopping for food and the abc market at the mall at the end of the road. On site laundry facilities. Make sure to catch the sunset in the ocean front chairs ", " Had a 3 day stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. A welcome start to the beautiful Big Island and the stark but mesmerising lava fields.Took a day to get our bearings and explore.Second day we did the volcano tour, a long but rewarding day.Unfortunately an all too short stay, but would love to come back here again. The breakfasts were amazing. So much so you could go thru to dinner time without feeling hungry ", " This big island Hilton Resort is on 63 acres, nice bay for snorking, paddle boarding and other water toys. This is a great resort no need to leave, as a Hilton Diamond members still pay $25 for self parking, but get $10 per person per day to spend on anything. Breakfast is large buffer $30. One good thing is watching the sunset, KPC need reservations for dinner and all outside tables have a great view. They have a Na Hoku jewelry store. One last thing everything closed early 9pm, also the Ocean tower bar was closed, so between 3-5 pm NO Food available. One last thing make sure you ride the Boat and rail system.. ", " We recently returned to the Hilton Waikoloa after a few years off from our last visit. It is hard not to love this place, as it has everything you need for a wonderful relaxing stay without even having to leave the property. We were treated to an upgraded oceanfront room which was appreciated. I will say that upon check in we were notified that the Chinese restaurant over the pizza place was now closed. Also, the nice lounge/bar near the lobby was closed for remodeling. This was a disappointment, as it reduces the number of places to have a good drink or meal at the resort. The pizza place is still a wonderful spot if you can sit out on the lovely patio with amazing views. This Hilton resort continues to have some ongoing problems with the transportation issues within the property. Certain times there is a very long wait for a boat or tram to pick you up. It is my opinion that both should be operating all day and night, but at times the boat does not run at all. Although this is annoying, you can work around the problem. There is a channel on the TV that provides the resort map, showing the time frame for any pickups in whatever tower you occupy. This helps to time things right if you need to get to the lobby or off property. We stayed in the Ocean tower and the bird noise was less frightening than our previous visits. We were located in the last ring (closer to the ocean) so perhaps this area is a bit better than the other two rings. I will admit that the room is a bit dated and could use some upgrades. The furniture is scratched in places and some minor stains here and there. With a spectacular balcony view of budda point it is hard to dwell on minor problems with a room that you spend very little time in. This resort is always a treat for us, as we are here for the views and relaxation. The outdoor areas are so well kept and all pools clean and refreshing. The lagoon is a treat for snorkeling and the spa is wonderful as well. You really can't go wrong here, although some things I hope will be improved upon before our next visit. ", " This hotel was perfect for our family. Easy to navigate, lots of options, and beautiful grounds. Hotel pricing was part of a group package and we weren't disappointed. Decent value for the price, though restaurants were pretty pricey, they were on par for HI. Gift shops were totally reasonably priced. ", " We truly love this resort, every year we stay for 2 or 3 weeks. The staff is wonderful. Starting with Ginger, she is a beautiful, sweet, caring, and reliable person, she checks on us making sure we are having a wonderful time while insuring our room is satisfactory. Matthew Lane, the director of the front office, is very kind and accommodating while being very professional. He is very easy to talk with and returns calls promptly. Freda Balagson and Bhelle, are two other people that are very dedicated workers up front. Really love the spa - I go there everyday, I really enjoy the steam room with a lava pot at the center, a huge vanity, nice organized lockers and a beautiful lava jaccuzzi. They also have a peaceful patio, lots of available towels along with robes that are big and comfortable. I love the policy at the Kohala Spa, in particular the fact that guests have access all day all the time (as long as you stay at the Makai tower). This rule is totally opposite of the Grand Wailea which is in Maui. I hope this policy does not change at the Hilton. All the staff members are wonderful. Tai is very reliable and friendly. Kami Carlos is also a very hardworking staff member who is always smiling. Also Paulo seems very happy and friendly. Jackie is a very good masseuse, very nice and kind lady, I always request her. The housekeeping staff is on the ball. Rose Asuncion is a very hard working sweet and friendly person. Our room is very clean and organized, and we never have to ask for anything. She does her work with a very positive attitude. Lorna Carpio is also very accomodating, she makes sure we have everything and conducts herself in a very professional manner. Lets talk about the amazing world class valet staff...R.J., Lopaka, Philip, Sheldon, Neil and Hoddon are just some of the staff that are super friendly while taking a genuine interest in you and your day. They always seem to have a smile on their face; they are very hard working in taking care of your luggage, retrieving your auto quickly, collecting your beach towels, offering water etc...these guys are simply the best. The lagoon grill is a great location to view the dolphins while enjoying a good fast meal - too bad they got rid of the lobster sandwich which we loved. Jeric Namahoe, the hardworking manager has a great personality while taking great care of the guests, at both the lagoon grill and at the waters edge breakfast buffet. His staff at the lagoon grill are also amazing offering great service with a smile...thank you Vicky Baliente, Lolita, Grace Corpus, Marry and the entire staff...At the fish pipe we would like to say thanks to Rachel who we have seen for many years and always remembers our names while displaying a very outgoing personality....Vicky Ramirez, who works at the pool and slide is a very bubbly woman while always having a kind word to say while making sure the guests are safe on the slide. At the Orchid Market, Paula always remembers us also, she is very efficient and friendly. What makes this place hard to beat is when you combine this special type of staff with this truly remarkable resort. With sincere thanks to everybody, Rod and Elsa Kossack from California ", " We were the lucky one to have a hurricane while on vacation here. Of course, the hurricane only swipe the south part of the island, but it was all sunshine here. I guess that was the reason why the airport was close by here. ", " This Hilton resort has just about everything a vacation traveler could ask for. The setting is beautiful, the accomadations were great and the staff was friendly and very helpful without being intrusive.We stayed in the Makai section of the Lagoon tower after upgrading from the Ocean tower after reading several very negative reviews about the Ocean tower. We would recommend either the newly renovated Palace tower of the Lagoon tower, or for a few extra bucks, the Makai rooms in the Lagoon tower. The ocean view itself was worth it.Dining is a bit pricey, but worth it except for the Imari Japanese restaurant. Ho hum service and you can get better sushi or sashimi at the nearby Island Gourmet ABC store. Definitely try the sunset dining on the terrace at KPC, great food, great location, great service, very romantic!The pools were great for both kids and adults, large and not crowded. You have a choice between fresh water and salt water.Thanks to all the resort staff, Samantha, Kit and all the rest, very helpful, considerate and familiar with the island and the resort. ", " I stayed at the Hilton as a member of Team in Training; a group raising money and participating in the Lavaman Triathlon. Our stay was awesome. The grounds are expansive and beautiful. A bit of a workout to traverse from our room to the front desk but I didn't mind the opportunity to walk and see the beautiful vistas. Enjoyed our daily walk up to Queen's Market for coffee and grocery shopping. Woudl definitely return. ", " Great Place, service was real 1st class, Will take my family again next time for sure!Solid 4 star hotel & SERVICE. Birds are a little noisy get you some earplugs @ the DeskWater from the Valet was a welcome surprise to keep hydrated. Shops are close. ", " This is our second time at the resort and it is still a first rate experience. It offers a lot to do if you do not want to leave the hotel grounds but close enough to different attractions within the proximity of the resort. It has good restaurants, a good lagoon for snorkeling, and offers other activities. Overall, this is a great place to stay. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort is a true resort. It's almost like a community within itself. This is my 5th visit with my 6th coming up next month. Planning my 7th. There is lots to do without leaving the resort and you never get bored. ", " This Resort is by far the best I have ever stayed in, and I traveled the world. Every single care was provided for. Beds and rooms were amazing, food, restaurants, pools and beach experience was brilliant, and the best thing was swimming with the dolphins. I highly recommend this resort. ", " The room was not that great for the price, however the property as a whole was great. Lots of attractions, Dolphin quest,and more. Plus lots of nice shopping. The help was very friendly, train going through the whole property was nice, ", " After two miserable nights at the adj. Marriott and with the Triathlon making getting around the area almost impossible we decided to have breakfast at the buffet as the Marriott has literally one restaurant/bar and were tired of it. When we got here we were shocked by the scale of the place and it's overall beauty. The Marriott calls itself a resort, it isn't. This is a resort complete with monorail, boats, dolphins, a lagoon, and many restaurants and shops. After having a far superior breakfast at the buffet, which btw we were told not to eat at by the owner of A Bey's who seemed to have a grudge against Hilton or something we decided that we would move here for the remaining 3 nights of our honeymoon regardless or not if Marriott would cancel the rest of our stay. To their credit they did so we didn't have to eat the $1,000 that our room would cost for the remaining days. Samantha at the front desk was amazing. She made us feel welcome and got us a great rate on a Hele Ike Palace Suite which had the view we wanted as well as the grandeur and amenities we wanted. I cannot thank her enough for saving us from the nightmare that was the Marriott. Our suite was approx 1,500 sqft with 1.5 bathrooms, a jetted tub, glass shower, 2 TV's, a PlayStation 3, and 5 balconies. We had views of the ocean, the gold course, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. Everything was clean and well kept. The pools are great, the Dolphin experience was fun though very pricey and we loved the luau. The only negatives are that the lobby lounge was under renovation and the rest of the restaurants bar offerings were minimal. The pizza place fyi charges for cheese which is ridiculous. Good pizza but $3.50 for cheese on a build your own!!! I would happily stay here again and also with Hilton in general more. Thank you again for making 2/3rds of our honeymoon as special as it could be. ", " My family and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village last month and can't stop gushing over the beauty of the expansive property and the remarkable staff. Thank you, Hilton Waikoloa Village, for providing us with an experience we will always remember. We will most certainly be back! ", " We stayed at this Hilton Resort for Five Nights in late September. It is a first class resort with boats and a tram to get around the facility, There are several excellent restaurants on site.The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is very available to answer any questions and generally provides excellen service. ", " I would strongly recommend this hotel, if you are planning on visiting big island, Hawaii. The place was beautiful, nicely manicured, nested in clam ocean. Many activities ranging from swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, golf and great Luau show. Many great restaurants on site, walking trail, and we even enjoyed just sitting near ocean watching sunset. In the ocean water play area, it even has turtles so you can swim and watch, and dolphins!!! Visit Hapuna beach ~10-miles away from this hotel. We loved this place and likely visit again! ", " My wife and I stayed at this wonderful hotel in late August. Our room for the week was a Deluxe OceanView located in the Ocean Tower; we could not have been more pleased with the experience. The Ocean Tower was located furthest from the lobby and the last stop for the tram or boats, but after reading reviews, was the precise tower we were looking for; away from the hustle and bustle. Did the tram take a bit to get there and back? Yes, but it's vacation, what's the rush.... Most days we chose to walk to the lobby (about 10 minutes), no sense losing our FitBit challenges just because we are in Hawaii right? There is so much beauty and art located between the tower and lobby, it is really a great walk.The grounds are well maintained and beautiful. Some areas were so tranquil and peaceful, with no other soul around, it made for a very relaxing stay.Staff was friendly and courteous. We used valet parking every day, never having to wait longer than 5 minutes for our vehicle to arrive, and always told to enjoy our adventure for the day.I will have to agree with others; prices on food were a bit on the high side. I think I spent $34 one morning on 2 coffees, two breakfast sandwiches and scone... lessen learned, go to the Starbucks in the Queens Shops, save yourself $20.Our stay was magical and perfect, sunsets were extraordinary, we could not have asked for anything more. ", " The Hotel has undergone changes, but the staff remains first rate. The amenities make this a great place to escape reality and relax. A few more food options would make this an all inclusive type of resort. Nearby options make this a go-to place. ", " So many activities here from swimming with the dolphins to snorkeling in the lagoon. Riding the boats are always a fun thing to do.. you can't go wrong hanging at the pool or going down the slides with the family. Come enjoy and make some memories. ", " This was the most beautiful hotel we've ever set foot in. The staff/service were very friendly and the food was delicious. Our room was nice and tidy, the bed very comfy. The whole area of the hotel is kept very clean and is being kept in very good shape. Regarding taste and activities there is something for everyone. ", " My husband and I stayed at the Hilton with the Adult Inclusive Experience package. We had a wonderful time and I would highly recommend this hotel. The hotel is well maintained, the ocean view room is amazing and the staff were excellent. ", " We stayed over a week at this luxurious tropical resort. The beauty of the man-made environment delighted us. The imagination and skill that contributed to this tropical paradise which delivered photo shot opportunities every way you looked were memorable. The staff worked very hard, and with smiled on their faces to give us the best possible experience. It was a tremendous treat to stay at this beautiful resort.Oh I forgot to mention the waterfall and turtle swim in the extensive lagoon. And the unforgettable breakfasts in the ballroom. Dream world, just like Disneyland and wonderful for families and/or couples. ", " Living in Hawaii is expensive and we have to fly thousands of miles to get-away. A great option is to stay right here at home and take advatage of the great kamaaina rates at the Hilton Waikoloa. Visit durig the slower months if you want peace and quiet. If your into alot of activity, visit at the peak of summer. ", " We brought a multi-generational family consisting of 2 grandparents, two adult child-free couples, and a couple with two small kids (3 and 1 years) to the Big Island, and this resort NAILED IT! There was truly something for everyone here.Through Costco, we got a fantastic deal that included ocean/dolphin view rooms in the Makai tower. Stunning view and great room!The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The made-to-order omelette station included kalua pork and purple sweet potatoes, among many other interesting choices that made breakfast the main meal of the day.Loved the lagoon - rented paddle boats and SUP paddleboards, which was fun. The pool by the Makai Tower was fantastic. LOVED the beach entry into the kiddie pool - the kiddos played for hours and we positioned ourselves so adults were next to the main pool, so we could be together.Spa was HUGE and the treatments were relaxing and exactly what I was looking for (got a facial and massage package).We loved the Lava Lava Beach Club nearby and actually went there three times for dinner.Would definitely go back! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is one of my top resorts to come back to when on the Big Island of Hawaii. You could never leave the property and still feel like you had a great Hawaiian vacation, it is that large. You actually can take a monorail shuttle to your building after you check in if you don't want to make the 15 minute walk to the furthest buildings. I had a room on the ground floor overlooking the bay, which was super convenient for walking out the porch to the pool area. The breakfast buffet is expensive, (but normal for resort prices) but you will leave full with a huge selection of food. Enjoy your time here, there are great restaurants within walking distance, and you can never go wrong with grabbing some drinks from the poolside bar and floating around. ", " Great tennis courts and the pros were so helpful. They bring you ice water and lemon-grass scented towels. They also set me up to play doubles with similar skill levels. You can't beat the amenities at this resort. Make sure to visit the pro shop and ask for Ron. ", " Had a great vacation here. Our room had an incredible view of the dolphin pool and ocean front. The room was large, nicely furnished and comfortable. The grounds are over 60 acres beautifully landscaped. Great to walk or jog. The steak house, HPC is exceptional. Great meal with beautiful ocean sunset view. Overall a great resort. We will be back. ", " Here at \"Hawaii Land\" huge resort complete with tram and many resort amenities. Spacious comfortable rooms and on site restaurants. Golf course located close by that is in beautiful shape! Lots to see and do with family friendly activities ", " Our second opportunity to stay at this lovely resort. It's perfect for families as well as a couple getaway! My husband and I enjoyed sunsets at kpc as well as the excellent service and food. We enjoyed the adult pool as well as the pools with slides. We enjoyed learning more about Hawaiian culture in the Ukulele and lai classes. We plan to return again, bringing our entire family. ", " This Hotel has plenty to interest every family member from the Monorail and Venetian Boat, which ensure the 70 Acres are easily accessible, to the Chapel by the sea. There are waterslides, dolphins and turtles to swim with. These is a huge saltwater lagoon. Immaculate gardens beautifully maintained and terrific themed restaurants to eat in. This hotel will not disappoint. ", " Staying here is not just about a room, it's an experience. The grounds are meticulously cared for and the staff is unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful. There are multiple pools to choose from and activities offered both on and off site and plenty of beach toys. I stayed in the Ocean Tower. This meant getting around was a bit interesting. I timed it. It took me 9 minutes to walk from my room (using the walkway) to the front entrance of the hotel. I did have the option of taking a tram or a boat, both lovely although time consuming. It only took 7 minutes to walk to the front entrance by taking the poolside pathways. This walk is also beautiful. I ate on property at Dona and Toni's, the breakfast buffet, the Lagoon Grill, the Cantina, the Orchid Marketplace and Waikoloa Coffee with no issues and great service. I did go to Walmart when I arrived, and only used the restaurants for appetizers if possible. Sunsets were spectacular. I especially loved the ritual- the seashell horn dramatically announced sunset, then a young man ran throughout the property lighting each torch, then repeating the seashell horn afterwards. On property, you can see numerous birds, a mongoose or 12, koi, beautiful honu and the dolphins. A few feral cats did come by to say hello as well. I loved walking out to the point at night, listening to the water and stargazing. Full disclosure- I work for a company affiliated with Hilton, but did not receive anything in exchange for a review of this property. ", " While the Hilton is not cheap it is well worth the expense. We stayed for two nights.The service is exceptional which is even better as it is a huge place with extensive array of staff. The room was very quiet and comfortable and the range of amenities outstanding. Just being there is an experience. Highly recommended ", " We had a wonderful time. Stayed for 6 nights. Had an ocean view room in Ocean tower. While the room was not recently updated it was clean and the view was beautiful. The walk is a bit far, and gets old after a few days but not terrible. If you are lucky enough to catch the tram, take it. It was about a 13 min walk from room to front desk (valet parking) which most of the time is faster than waiting for tram. Breakfast was good, we loved Chris at the egg station. Staff was all very friendly. In fact, we saw Ben, a bartender at an offsite beach and he offered us use of his paddle boards. Kpc steakhouse is amazing at sunset, try to get a table in the \"front row\" for sunset. Main pool was big enough that it never seemed crowded. Cabana rental and service was great. There is a lot to do on the island, do yourself a favor a rent a car and take a day to drive around entire island. Loved this vacation and would definitely stay here again. ", " I loved the pools and the dolphin encounter! There was so much to do on the resort. The food was very good and the option to get pizza to go was very convenient. The staff was extremely helpful and curteous. ", " This was my third stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. With its beautifully manicured expansive grounds, huge sparkling pools with waterfalls and slides, an ocean-fed lagoon and a variety of restaurants, we were happy spending almost all of our time there. The breakfast buffet is extensive, though a bit overpriced if not included in the room package. The hotel's luau is good, but very pricey at approximately $160, if you want good seats for the show. We opted to skip it this time and explore other options. Overall, this is my favorite resort to kick back and relax. ", " Stayed in a Bay Club villa. Highly recommend this accommodation if privacy, meals at home, exploring the island are on your agenda. You still have access to the Hilton main hotel and all of its amenities but you have the privacy of having your own apartment & dining at home. Children might not like it so much. Parents with children might like it a lot as dining out is $$$$$$!Staff is outstanding in friendliness, accommodating, meeting your every need. Accommodations are roomy and comfortable. Dining in has its limitations-you cook or stop & pick up. There are a few delivery places listed. The privacy far outweighs the need for dining out. However you can dress up and drive or shuttle to numerous wonderful restaurants--it just wasn't high on our need list. Pool facilities were mediocre. Small, not fancy but had bar & food & happy hour entertainment & friendly. Not a see and be seen venue. Totally laid back & let it all hang out kind of pool. Just right for our group. Every day we got up early, had coffee & breakfast on the lanai overlooking the golf course and Mauna Kea in the background. Every evening we had our wine same place but were visited by a host of cats who live untamed on the island and of course we fed them and of course they increased in numbers. Then there were the shy mongooses who came and all the colorful birds who showed up for crumbs. CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK. SAME PLACE. ", " My boyfriend and I had a wonderful 4-night stay the Hilton in Waikoloa Village. The resort is huge and has both a tram and boat that can be used to get around (although we found that it was much faster just to walk). The grounds themselves are beautiful, and I highly recommend walking around at sunset to enjoy the views.Our room in the Ocean Tower was inviting, spacious, and comfortable. We ordered take-out from both Kamuela Provision Company (KPC) and Imari, and enjoyed the fresh seafood immensely. The service was surprisingly fast as well!The lobby staff we interacted with was both helpful and accommodating. I have to give a special shout out to Kalehua, who took very good care of us and went above and beyond to provide stellar service. She truly made us feel welcome and we appreciated her efforts tremendously. We would definitely stay here again should our travels bring us back to the Big Island! ", " This was such a great place to stay. though I was dubious before I got there, once there I loved it the buildings incorporated plants and birds in the huge atrias, while large, there is both tram and water boat transportation around the complex. Pools on the beach, massages and day trip planning are all here but the real gem is the lagoon linked directly to the ocean, it teems with wildlife, more than Hanama bay. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a beautiful property with outstanding people that work for them. They make the trip extra special and always take wonderful care of you. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend this beautiful place. ", " Recently stayed at this property. Beautiful. We were only there for 4 full days and we enjoyed the property sufficiently that we didn't bother scheduling any other island excursions. We enjoy playing tennis and the facilities and staff here are great. There's an on-site coffee shop which satisfied my caffeine needs. We tried several of the restaurants and I really enjoyed a \"burger and beer\" outside by the dolphins. We splurged one night and had dinner at the KPC and the food and view were great. Just be prepared to pay for the experience. So, what's the gripe? My wife and I enjoy lounging around the pool after a good morning of tennis and the pools here are really nice. But - no shade. and I mean - no shade. This is pretty common for pool areas but if you like to escape the direct sun then there are only a couple of key areas that get shade. But you better stake those out early if you don't like frying in the sun. There are \"cabanas\" for rent - and lounge chairs with the pull over \"shade\" things... but i find those offer limited escape from the sun and you're likely to \"bake\" in the enclosed area. In fact, I saw several people using those who ended up covering parts of their body with towels. Seems to me there is a huge up-sale potential for the pool if they could rent umbrella's. I, for one, would have tried to rent one. Maybe they don't offer umbrellas due to the prevailing winds on the Kona side - not sure. There is a reserved section of one of the pools for Makai rooms and those have palm trees which offer a bit of moving shade. But we found all the lounge chairs taken by people that didn't have the Makai \"bracelet\" so it seems like oversight in the pool area is not very high. If you booked a Makai room don't assume that getting a decent lounge area will be easy.As always, I ask myself - would I go back? The answer to this is \"yes\". The next time I'm more likely to plan excursions rather than lounge around the pool unless I can plan being out there early to snag the few shade spots that are available. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village Hotel is an experience. Where else can you choose between going to your room on the property by walking, boat or by train? The rooms are well appointed with all amenities. Their staff are courteous, helpful and prompt. The real challenge is choosing between swimming with dolphins, experiencing their private lagoon with the humahumanukanukaapuaa and honu, dining at the Kamuela Provisioning Company, experiencing their world class spa or going to their excellent Legends of Hawaii Luau. The visual experience is beyond awesome from breath taking views of a Pacific sunset to art work from around the Pacific Rim. A must stay while on the Big Island! ", " We enjoyed a weeks stay at this beautiful property in August for part business and part pleasure. It's a very large and beautiful property with something to do for everyone. Our room was in the Makai at Lagoon Tower overlooking the lagoon. We happened to have a ground level room which was lovely because we could walk right out of our patio door onto the lawn and go wherever we wanted to. We really enjoyed the Kona pool with the waterfall. We found it very refreshing. There are several dining options available both on the hotel grounds as well as ones that you could drive to. ", " We just returned from our third visit to this Hilton property. My husband and I traveled together for the vacations and each was as great as the time before. We stayed in late September so there were never any crowds. There were always tons of empty chaise lounges and plenty of water front dining. Don't let the enormous size of this property scare you. There is so much to do and tons to explore. The restaurant KPC is a must while you are there. We have always stayed in a Makai room in the Lagoon Tower and will continue to do so because of the proximity to everything we like to do. ", " This resort had some of the best scenery on kona. High quality shops, with a staff that treats you like royalty. I've stayed all over the United States. This resort is absolutely breathtaking. Make sure you have a heavy wallet, as prices all over the island are just as breathtaking. Lol. Mahalo hgvc ", " This resort way surpassed our expectations. The restaurants, the beach areas, the views, the room, the dolphins, the grounds and the staff. It was hard leaving to explore the island because of how relaxed we felt just being there. Thank you Hilton for making our vacation a memory to last forever. ", " We came here on our honeymoon and then just came back from our 5 year anniversary. I love this place. Staff is so friendly and there is so much to do. We had some tiny ants in our room this time, but we aren't those guests that blow things out of proportion- things like that are going to happen from time to time. I let them know about it and they came and sprayed immediately. You judge a place based on their reaction and timeliness to issues and they were amazing. We enjoyed the lagoon very much and snorkeling with the turtles. The lava flows are fantastic. The food is amazing. Rooms are spacious. And the views.... breathtaking. I recommend to everyone I speak with. Thank you once again for giving us an amazing vacation. We will see you in 5 years! ", " Staff was friendly and courteous. Lots of activities for both adults and children. Swinging bridge is awesome. Staff feeding and training of the dolphins was very interesting. Rooms are awesome. Looking forward to going back ", " The pictures say it all, it's own micro climate that gets fantastic sun when the rest of the island is rainy, it ain't cheap, and when your there it's sort of $5 more expensive on almost everything - but well worth it The resort is immaculate, the lagoon a must visit, great service, really good size and comfortable well equipped roomsWould recommend anyone to stay if visiting the big island ", " I read the reviews about this resort before choosing. Don't know why it's not 5 stars from all! We enjoyed everything about this place. The food, the service, the friendly staff- even the playful wildlife (Mongoose and Mina birds galore!) The way to relax is just enjoy their spectacular salt water lagoon, with service/ food that can't be beat. The staff did everything they could to make us comfortable and feel at home. The tropical fish were nice to view, even when paddle-boarding. This place is big, and if you like to walk- then you are going to be right at home. The grounds are manicured and well maintained (hint- many call this place the D.....Land of Hawaii!) I know that not everyone rates this place high- but we had no issues with check-in, food, service, amenities, and the like. It was and exceeded our expectations. We'll be sure to come back again for many years to come. ", " My wife and I, both in late 50's, stayed here first week in Sept. Had a great stay! Highly recommended!The resort is beautiful and well maintained. Everyone we met there was very pleasant and helpful. We also liked the variety of food choices, mexican, italian, cafe by lagoon, fancy by ocean, and breakfast buffet.Yes, it's very large and we were in the furthest rooms from the lobby. But we enjoyed the 15 min walks to get there or took their shuttle tram or boat. They have displays at each stop showing when next transport will arrive.Yes the food is pricey but that's true anywhere in Hawaii. There is cheaper food up the street at Queen's Market.You definitely want a rental car as there is so much to visit in the Big Island. Hotel concierge will tell you best ways to see volcanoes, waterfalls, and beaches.We took a week long cruise around the islands after our week at Waikoloa Hilton and agreed the Waikoloa stay was the best! Prices and crowds are far worse at other islands. Also the weather at Waikoloa was far nicer than other islands.  ", " My Wife and I went here last May, it was great, room, snorkeling, swimming were all great. It's true about a beach not being at the resort but we found a few really nice ones just north of the resort. The birds were noisy at night but I thought it was kinda cool to hear them. Just set dates for a return trip this nov. this time bringing our granddaughter. If I could make a improvement, it would be nice to have a microwave in the room. ", " Everything about our stay here was more than I could have imagined. To start, the service. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. A special shoutout to Ginger, who made sure that our trip was nothing less than perfect. When Hilton says \"customer's first\", they truly mean it. I was particularly impressed with our house keeper as well. When I came back to my room our clothes were nicely folded and put in a corner, and the mess we made on our bathroom sink was transformed. Finally, the tours and entertainment staff was very accommodating. When we asked for good restaurant recommendations off the premise, he gave us a great place to go that, from what we could tell, was a local treasure. Next, the resort. All I can say is WOW. It is stunning. Everywhere you turn there is a new surprise. I guess that is what happens with a resort this large. For example, I was just walking down the path when I found a dolphin pool with a 16 day old dolphin that was a mere 10 feet away from me. Maybe I should have done more research, because I had no idea this was coming. My only complaint is that you can not get towels before 8 AM, and you need to bring them from your room. We found that out the hard way when we were told we had to go all the way back to our room to get them. However, this is a small issue that we overlooked by how positive our experience is overall. I cannot wait to go back! ", " My husband and I decided to get away for our anniversary and chose this hotel as our destination. So glad we did! The property is expansive and beautiful. It's good for both a couples retreat and for families. Everyone we encountered on staff was friendly and helpful. My husband secretly reserved a suite that was not only ocean front but had 5 balconies! We had beautiful views of the ocean and the mountains. It was breathtaking! There is so much to do on this property you almost don't need to leave. There are multiple pools. One has a slide and an interactive ride. The waterfalls were fun and the sound calming. We rented a cabana and enjoyed personalized service all day. You can also swim, snorkel or paddle board in the lagoon. There is a Dolphin Experience where you can swim with dolphins too. There are multiple places to eat on this property. We do agree with other reviewers on some being a bit pricey for what you get. We decided to offset some cost by going to the Queens Shops up the street and purchasing bottled water and snacks to keep in our room. We loved the buffet breakfast! It was our favorite. The tram and boat were helpful in transporting us to our building on the resort when we were to tired to walk. We loved our stay at this resort and hated when we had to leave. We will be back! ", " My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed here for my birthday week.We enjoyed our trip so much! The staff was great, everywhere seem cleaned, and not too crowded. Definitley don't skip the luau! Such a great time! Food is great and especially enjoyed the pool bars and waitstaff that came around as we were in the pool or lagoon! Also, the staff went the extra mile by placing \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" in pebbles and flowers as a surprise on the bed and then at night sent up chix covered strawberries! So sweet! ", " This was our first time on the big island and after reading all the comments its was a little overwhelming on what to do , so we rented a car and just enjoyed the ride. There's so much to do at this property you really don't have to leave they have amazing snorkeling in the lagoon which is perfect for young kids and starters (7, 8 years ) we swam with a sea turtle and saw 2 ! As well as many fish. The food is amazing no matter where you eat at the resort and the hospitality is outstanding ! The rooms are spotless as well as the property. Stay here you won't be disappointed .We will definitely be back ! ", " I was scared because of all the reviews but so pleasantly surprised. We got to swim with turtles and snorkel. Resort is beautiful. Coffee shop for breakfast. Dolphins I would love to return every year. This was by far one of the best resort experiences ever. If you are just there to visit for a few hours I could see how this might be overwhelming but stay and enjoy because it's not overwhelming. Just lots to see. ", " I have visited and enjoyed this property for over twenty years, and as far a I'm concerned, it just keeps getting better! I love taking the little boat ride around the property that delivers guests to their rooms and other areas-restaurants, etc. The pool and hot tub areas (there are two large main pool areas - be sure to visit both) are really fun with water slides and waterfalls. The lagoon area has water sports available such as paddle board yoga, snorkeling, etc. My husband is terrified of sharks so this lagoon is the only place he will snorkel (they say that a shark has never entered this lagoon) but there are always beautiful fish, turtles and eels to be spotted. There is a dolphin habitat area where you can watch and even purchase a dolphin experience. Even if you do not stay at this hotel, you should visit and enjoy the grounds, I have never been to another property that comes close to it - and I live in Las Vegas!I also must comment on the Kahala spa located on the property. Although I did not indulge in a massage service, I took an excellent yoga class from an instructor named Francesca. You can take the class even if you are not staying on property for $15, $10 if you are a registered guest. Although the rooms are nice, but not spectacular, I still consider this property to be as close to paradise as I can get - I even made sure to spend my honeymoon there. - ", " Aloha, we have had a wonderful stay here at the Hilton Waikoloa. Everyone has been kind and helpful, we will definitely return again in the not too distant future. The resort is huge, takes about 10-15 mins from the lobby to the Ocean Tower. Linda and Peter Svensson ", " This is an awesome resort! It's quite large and has a monorail and boat to take you around the property. Beautiful paths and trails. The pools were great! Lots of on-property dining choices. Even has a Dolphin experience on-property. Service was excellent. Property is great condition. Be sure to check out the Maki area, which is where we stayed. Definitely worth the extra $$ for the additional amenities. Loved it! Would stay there again in a heartbeat. ", " We had booked 2 partial ocean view rooms and we stopped off at the Island Gourmet Markets to pick up water and soda before getting to the hotel. We were given rooms in the Ocean tower with nice views. My mom did have a problem with her room keys but the concierge at the ocean tower reprogrammed them. The Kirin restaurant is closed and they no longer have the dining card but as a HH gold member I got 2 $10 dining coupons per room per night that helped. The resort is beautiful but large. The hotel was busy with families but it do not bother us, The breakfast buffet was good.We were there the weekend Tropical Storm Derby came through. There were notices on the display screens advising that if the wins were to strengthen we would be asked to bring in the table and chairs from the lanai into our rooms but in the event we had some wind and rain Saturday night ,some rain after breakfast on Sunday before the weather cleared. It was quite humid though. The shuttle bus to the King's shops was useful. During the week I saw several wedding ceremonies taking place overlooking the ocean. The rooms were well equipped and Dona and toni's restaurant was good. All the staff were very friendly. ", " Hilton Waikaloa is a beautiful property. We got to SUP and to snorkel (passed on the dolphins but they looked amazing). Food is good and breakfast buffet is huge but pricey. Try the nachos they are the cheep movie theater type but unlimited toppings lol.Special thanks to the Manager Simon who upgraded our \"ff miles room\" to the Makai tower. Sent us champaign and strawberries for our engagement/birthday and sent us to Luau. Super duper thanks sooo much!!! BTW Luau is super fun. Less \"authentic\" than the one i went to in Ouahu BUT all inclusive (ie drinks are free) dancers are excellent and music is nice. Host was charming. He even wished the \"townsley's\" well on our engagement BUT he did say happy birthday to Noize lol (her name is Noy.) ", " It's a beautiful property and the staff are fabulous. However - the property is very dated. One of the three towers has been renovated so I assume the rest of the property is well on its way. Great place for a convention of 1500 or fewer. Lots of activities close by. The two major issues I have with the property are optional items anyway - the tiny and shallow dolphin swim experience looks like hell on earth for the Dolphins. Time to close that up!!! And, due to being built on a lava flow, there isn't a sandy beach - so they've built an artificial lagoon that - according to many local reports- has the dirtiest water in Hawaii. I never went in. ", " Perfect hotel for a family holiday. Massive resort with three pools (that kids are allowed in). We had an ocean view in the Ocean Tower and the room (and view) were spectacular. The room had a king sized bed and a pull out couch. Large deck and slider door and view out to sea. The sunsets were amazing and the facilities for eating and swimming were well catered. Two of the pools had slides for kids (and adults). Travelling around the resort there was a monorail which departed every 10-15 minutes and boats that ran from 2pm to 10pm. The valet parking team were like magicians getting the cars with very minimal wait. Great place to holiday with family and cant wait to visit again. ", " Very cool hotel. So many activities but some have a hefty price tag. Lots of shops and places to eat. The hotel also seemed to be a sanctuary for cats. We had 4 cats that hung around our room and being a cat lover, I let them in to play and feed scraps, much to my boyfriends horror since he hates cats. But that was pretty cool that the hotel takes care of them. The pools were awesome and we had a vacation suite so no complaints about the huge bathroom we had and full size kitchen. ", " Used Hhonors points to spend our last Big Island night at this resort. My wife, daughter, and I were all blown away. The resort grounds are extensive and beautiful. The monorail and boat on the premises were helpful for getting around, and the boat gave us a romantic evening cruise under the stars. We spent most of our time swimming in the protected lagoon area with a view of the waterfall, and my daughter and I had fun goofing around on the multiple water slides. The resort fee includes DVD rentals of many new and favorite titles, and we had some nice evening entertainment before bed. I can't say enough about the professionalism and hospitality of the staff. We interacted with just about every type of employee during our short stay, and all were of the highest caliber service mindset. We got a couple of texts during our stay asking for us to reach out if we needed anything. At one point, I was walking down the hall alone and must have looked confused. An employee coming from the other durection smiled and said, \"Aloha! Let me know if I can help you with anything sir.\" I needed directions, which she gladly provided. The hotel accommodated early check-in and late check-out for us, allowing us to maximize our time and truly experience everything we wanted to. I have stayed in many Hilton properties over the years, but this tops all prior stays in terms of the property, the number of activities included within the resort fee, and the super-professionalism of the staff. Hats off! ", " Wonderful visit for our 35th wedding anniversary. Had a great room in the Lagoon tower overlooking the dolphin area and the ocean. Could view the Dolphins better from our room than when on the ground. Also, the food at Kamuela Provision Company (KPC) was outstanding. Loved the ginger steamed monchong!! We think the Hilton Waikoloa is the best hotel on the Big Island. Mahalo to Kriztine for her excellent service during our visit! ", " Excellent resort. Good food a bit expensive but ok for only two day stay Lagoon is great. Water slide amazing. Sunset view fabulous. Birds were kind of loud but that is splitting hairs Bathroom had two sinks which always helps when there are four in one room. ", " This hotel with enormous beautiful grounds offers a unique experience. There is a tram and a boat to get to your room if you wish. But if you choose to walk, you see wonderful art for a cultural experience. There are many pools and spas with a fun water slide. The views are magnificent. The staff is very solicitous and accommodating. We love staying here. ", " This was a very special vacation for the family. From the time we arrived at the hotel until we left the hotel, it was nothing but the best in service and quality. Be prepare for cost as it can be pricey however, it is well worth it. Everyone of the hotel staff was helpful and very pleasant to talk too. If you plan a family trip to Hawaii, I would highly recommend the Hilton for a family trip. Enjoy the Islands ", " After coming from Waikiki, I was dreading our decision to stay at yet another huge complex.... Wow!! Was I wrong!! From the second we pulled up to the valet, I was so happy we had chosen this property!! Everything from the boats, trams, artwork and foliage give this place very tropical and relaxed feel. Check in was a breeze and Nicholas at the front desk was wonderful. We were able to check into our room early which was a huge plus. We booked the Dolphin Suite in the Lagoon tower which was a fabulous room right in front of the Dolphins and overlooking the ocean. Our bi level suite was amazing and we got to watch the equally amazing training staff care for the beautiful creatures. They were also waiting for a dolphin pup to be born so we got to see everything first hand. Unfortunately, he/she wasn't born by the time we left but we called for an update!!My only negative comment is that the room had a mildewish smell. We had to keep the huge doors to our huge lanai (with a hot tub and BBQ) open for fresh air. The doors to the lanai need to be changed. They are heavy, old and a real challenge to open and close. French doors or sliders would be much better. Another suggestion would be to replace the office area of the room with a dining table since that room comes with a kitchen. The shops, staff and pool area were all wonderful. Everyone we encountered was great, friendly and helpful. The property is meticulously maintained and workers prune the grounds and clean the lagoon on a daily basis. I found the lagoon tower very peaceful. It is the ideal location, in my opinion, as it is close to the front desk and shops and pool. We rented cabanas at the lagoon pool as there was no shade anywhere and there are no umbrellas. Umbrellas are a necessity. The pool area is large and very hot and sunny. We ate a few times at the restaurant near the dolphin lagoon. It was consistent on service and the food was always good and served in a very timely manner. All in all, I loved the relaxed feel of this hotel would highly recommend it. I would not hesitate to come back. ", " We had a room on the ground floor of the Lagoon tower. The perfect location for heading out to the pools for the day. This stay was on an All-Inclusive booking which I can highly recommend, breakfast and dinner included each day as well as drinks for the entire stay, and including the amazing Legends of Hawaii Luau. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikola Village last week for our honeymoon and it was AMAZING!!! We were upgraded to a ocean view when we booked a resort view. It was lovely. We stayed in the Ocean Tower it was a little far from the main lobby but very worth it. Not many kids in this building and great views! Friendly staff every where we went in the village. The lagoon was amazing. We were able to observe a sea turtle in the water only a few feet from us! Overall great resort. Marie Elena checked us in and she was great. Very efficient yet friendly and inviting! The resort is only 30 minutes from Kona. And the village has its own gas station, shops, and restaurants. This resort was top notch! We will definitely be returning to Waikola Village soon! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is the ultimate family vacation destination. My children and grand children and I had the most spectacular time ever. The grand children were given the opportunity to pick a different destination for vacation this year and they unanimously voted to go back to Hawaii. There is literally something for everyone at this resort. If you want to feel absolutely decadent, have a massage by the ocean or relax in one of the many incredible restaurants for a fine dining experience. The children will be in awe over the pools, waterfalls and the lagoon with the many fish and sea turtles swimming around. This is a place where you never need to leave the resort to experience everything that Hawaii has to offer. It is an incredible resort that has been extremely well thought out and provides memories to last a lifetime. ENJOY!! ", " Great place to stay in honeymoon couple or with families.The lagoon and waterfall is simply amazing.Is a great place to swim with children looking and playing with turtles or dolphins.Lovely stay in Hawaii Big Island. ", " This is my favorite Waikoloa hotel. Lots of activities, great location, and lots of food options. If you have kids, I'd suggest not staying in tower with adult only pool, the lagoon tower is hard to beat! ", " Older property that is special in so many ways. Location, dolphins, resturant views, boat ride to rooms..... all make for a wonderful stay as a couple or family.They continually work on the upkeep and I have stayed there many times if i dont want to stay in or around Kona. Takes 20 min from Airport and 30 minutes from Kona to get there.Don't go during Ironman or Half Ironman event weeks unless you book early. Bike course runs on highway out in front. I stayed there when I did Ironman in 2003. Wonderful bath when i got back to my room at midnight !Then great dinner on the point with friends the next night. Tremendous view and memory making place.Rob.... Ironman1980 ", " you'll love the Hilton in Kona, the tram the rooms, the views, the pools are all great. it's a bit of a drive to Hilo but it's a very nice resort. just have to time the tram when you're heading out each time. ", " My second time to Kona, but this time did it up by booking the Hilton Waikoloa through United Vacations. The place is the most amazing resort I've stayed at. Beautiful rooms, huge property with pools, lagoons, water slides, swim with dolphins pool, spa, amazing fitness center, even a tram or boat to shuttle you around the property. Sunset this evening right outsidemy balcony (Ocean Tower, Room 5078) was just stunning. Great food options, but kind all of Hawaii, get set for sticker shock on anything you buy. Resort competitive with the high prices at Queens Market, a short $2 trolley ride from the resort, so just accept the high prices. Lots of kids and families but place is so big that you still have your space and even privacy if you want it. Really pampered myself with this place, but price was very reasonable in the package I booked with United Vacations.  ", " My family enjoyed our stay here. We had the best services from once we checked in until we checked out. We stayed at the ocean tower with a king size bed, a sofa bed and a pull out bed. We bought water bottles and food from costco. They provided us with a fridge and microwave. But we had to pay a one time fee for the microwave throughout the whole stay it may have been around $20. My 3 year enjoyed the spacious room. There are 3 outside pools (some with slides and water fall) to choose from and a lagoon that houses fishes and turtles. They had kayaks and paddle boards to rent. For fourth of july the hotel had a shuttle that brought us to the Queens market place which had live music and fireworks. It was only a 5 min drive and was totally worth it. The best part my family and I enjoyed from this trip was the Luau!! Great food! Great show!! A must do!! ", " There is something available to do no matter what age you are. We have a baby who has stuff to do, whether it is in the pool, beach or garden. The staff at the hotel is very nice and helpful. I like that there are different theme areas so it is not doing the same activities each day, especially for the kids. The kids love their activities offered at the hotel. They especially love swimming with the Dolphins. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island has good size rooms for 3 adults and one older child. I took a video of a sea turtle 10 inches away from me that swam under the waterfall. There was an easy entrance to the lagoon. The Italian restaurant was very pricey, $26 for a seafood pasta, but it was rdelicious! The coy fish were beautiful at the Ocean tower and the man on the boat ride was very friendly. It was very helpful knowing when the shuttle bus or the boat was arriving by looking at the computer at the stations.Aloha! ", " Wonderful place. Went with friends and family. Everything was perfect. Beautiful place. First time there. My four adult children, my 6 grand children 2 adult grandchildren and 4 teen grandchildren. W e met some of our friends that came down. They plan the trip for all of us. We were there for 7 days and 6 nights. It was a very nice trip The food was good where we went to and the hula dancers was very good. I would tell everyone to go here, it is a beautiful state. ", " We stayed at 5 different places whilst in Hawaii for our honeymoon and this was our favourite by far. We loved it. Stay in the Lagoon tower and get an ocean view. We didn't book transfers and just got a taxi, super easy and $65. The Big Island has a great relaxed vibe to it. The hotel has everything you need. There's a $2 shuttle to the local shops if you want different food (great Thai and Italian there plus subway etc) and a food store for cheap alcohol etc. We recommend Macaroni grill for food (dinner - don't recommend breakfast). Also do a volcano helicopter tour - it was our highlight! ", " This is truly a village! So many things to discover! We were situated in the 3rd Tower on the first level with a suite overlooking the sea! Wonderful! You can navigate the grounds by foot, boat or train. And you can swim with the dolphins or hold a beautiful exotic bird on your hand. Love this place! ", " A fantastic stay even though it was only one night. I would love to come back with my kids for 4 days. The room was clean and modern as was the whole resort. The Lua was great family entertainment with a delicious buffet style dinner. There are many different style pools to choose from. We needed more days to check it all out.The Resort boat and train transfers were a novel and efficient way of getting around this massive resort. ", " We live on the island (in Volcano) and always choose the Hilton for all of our staycation get aways. Be sure to get the breakfast buffet at the Water's Edge restaurant in the morning, it's very big with lots of choices, and an omelet station.Our family prefers to get a room in the Ocean Tower so we can be near the Kohala Pool. It is more mellow and has smaller water slides. We love to rent one of the cabanas they have poolside, if available. The sun gets very hot and we like to have a shady spot with perks. (They bring you ice water, fruit and 30 minutes of water toy rental if you get #15, 16 or 17). Unfortunately, when we booked the Ocean Tower this trip, they put us in the Palace Tower instead. The Palace is better for couples or single travelers because it is so far from the pools. We also prefer the Ocean Tower because its a great location to observe the pretty sunsets.We occasionally stay at the Marriott, but, the Waikoloa Hilton is by far the best, for quality, value and hospitality.  ", " I know there's no doubt Hilton Waikoloa Village is beautiful with majestic views of the Pacific, well-kept grounds and plenty of options for activities (snorkeling, numerous pools, ocean front dining, dolphins and much more!), but the attitude of the staff here in the midst of their busy season is to be commended! For the sheer volume of guests they serve (many of whom are not very pleasant to deal with) is overwhelming and would tax the best of us, especially when sustained over several days, weeks and months! I'd like to mention Freda at the front desk (who's been here since the late 80's!) who's made us feel at home with her welcoming, pleasant and gracious attitude-to Aleesha (sp?) at the coffee shop (she deals with lines/100's of impatient people for hours every day!) who keeps her beautiful smile at all times regardless and offers wonderful service to her customers, including us...Needless to say we're making memories and enjoying every moment of our visit here! Thank you HWV team! ", " We had a blast. Gorgeous views of the ocean. Fun pools great lagoon water area. Great staff and over all fun and family friendly amotspshere. Will stay again and would recommend for anyone else to stay there. ", " The pools are great, plenty of slides, sand entry for the tots, huge. Concierge is very attentive, you can text them to schedule activities. The lagoon has turtles daily that you can swim/snorkel along. Food parking is expensive. It's also huge requiring a tram to get around. Rooms are very clean and the views are what you want when you come to Hawaii. Staff is great.

Local shopping just over one mile but it's a lovely walk. Fridge in room to store snacks etc if you don't want to eat in restaurants the entire trip. The mango mojito was yummy. ", " Second time at the Hilton Waikoloa Village with our teenagers. Great time! Our room was in the Lagoon Tower, so we had clear view of the dolphins bassin and sea. The room was clean. The staff is great and professional. Many things to do the site: snorkling, kayak, paddleboard, etc. One nignt, we did the gazing of the stars and it was amazing. We highly recommend this hotel. Fun for everyone! ", " Had a great time getting away from O'ahu. Place was beautiful. Ocean tower is more for adults and is quiet. Great time to visit as lava is flowing into ocean. They helped us plan a boat trip to volcano. Food was excellent if not resort pricey. There is local shops which have some more options. ", " Just retuned from 5 days at the Hilton Waikoloa Villege. We were 6 adults and 4 kids ranging in age from 7 years to new born staying in 3 rooms. The hotel was perfect for us and offered plentry to do for both kids and adults. Upon check-in the front desk took the time to find us 3 rooms adjoining which was much appreciated we had a wonderful time and took full advantage of the Hiltons 62 acres in paradise. ", " One of the best places ever. The place is amazing, the staff is amazing, food amazing. Our room was wonderful . Lots of activities to keep you busy. We can't wait to go back and enjoy this property again. ", " This is a beautiful, well layed out class A resort. Our room faced the lagoon. Past the lagoon was the beautiful Pacific Ocean. In the lagoon there are dolphins. For a hefty fee, you could get in the water with them and swim with them, but we just enjoyed sitting on our balcony and watching them swim and be fed. It was amazing how they would \"pose\" with people while their picture was being taken.The bathroom here was the best! The toilet and shower were in a separate room. There was this huge vanity with a double sink that two people could easily use. The very best part of this resort was the pool. It started out as a shallow area with sand for the small kids. Then there was this wall in the water and the rest of the pool began. The pool was about 40 ft wide and it just winded around like a river under one bridge, then another. It eventually ended at a huge rock mountain with waterfalls that you could swim under. There was a hot tub under it and the entrance to a water slide. There were a couple other hot tubs along the way. It was like an adventure. All other pools paled in comparision. ", " Our family (38, 36, 11, 11) loved this hotel. We stayed in a makai room in lagoon tower. The view was amazing. The pools our outstanding. Even the walk around the resort is fun with mini-museums and natural sights. The packages with the big island buffet are well worth it (I reviewed the amazing buffet separately. )The lagoon is an amazing experience for young kids. We saw an uncountable variety of fish and three or four sea turtles by the waterfall. We walked on the shore and found shells and creatures on the reef. One night we bough ice cream at the shop and watched Finding Nemo at the pool.  ", " Stayed in the Villas which made the vacation for four, very affordable. Spent most of our time snorkeling in the cove and swimming in the pools. Although we did many activities around the Island, we could have remained in the Village every minute and loved it. ", " This was one of the best resorts i have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Kelly and Matt at the front desk were fantastic with helping my family and i with our needs. The pool, lagoon and restaurants were all excellant. My next trip to the big island will be there! ", " This place is big, but oh SOOO amazing. Everyone is so friendly and the room are big and clean. We got upgraded for our honeymoon to the Makai suite which was so amazing, we have never been upgraded for anything in our lives before. Thank you Hilton for an amazing experience. Do yourselves a favour and take the time to get to know the island, it has so many hidden treasures. ", " Probably my favorite hotel & resort that I have ever stayed at. It is very large and offers so many things to do. The people working here are great. Never a problem finding a great place to sit by the pool or lagoon - simply gorgeous. They have s tram to move you around as well as a small boat. Great place for a family vacation. The pools are fantastic. There are several slides too. ", " This is a perfect destination for families !! The pools are great!!! The tram that runs through the hotel makes it a lot easier to navigate the large property. The dolphin adventure is a must. Particularly enjoyed the open water cove where you can snorkel and paddle board with turtles and any sea life that swims in. FANTASTIC ", " We loved our stay in this tropical paradise! The staff was helpful, positive, and laid-back. We enjoyed the variety of pools and restaurants. We were disappointed that some areas were closed off for a private event. ", " Waikoloa Village by Hilton is a First Class Resort on the west side of the Big Island. The resort has everything including spacious rooms that have ocean views! Great amenities coupled with excellent shopping and restaurants. Other activities can also be arranged; such as helicopter excursions and trips to Oahu to visit Pearl Harbor or other venues. We enjoyed this as a couples trip but it would be great for the entire family. The resort is expensive so use honor points if you have them! Sunsets are Fantastic! Aloha! ", " Pure and simple, this is a great choice for families with young children. The pools and lagoon are incredible. My kids got to swim next to sea turtles almost daily and loved seeing all the different fish in the lagoon. The on-property dining options were fantastic. We dined at every restaurant (twice at Inari), and enjoyed each of them. While the resort is large, the tram and boats make it fairly easy to navigate, even with an easily-distracted 4-year old. I would not necessarily recommend this hotel if you have mobility issues, as we had to walk a couple of times when the tram was out of service. Even then, they were running extra boats.....we just didn't feel like waiting. No big deal. Overall, we are already talking about returning to this property at some point in the future. We stayed for 7 nights and never really left the resort. When we did, it was to shop and dine at the King's Shops/Queens Marketplace, which is just a few blocks away. ", " I enjoyed 6 nights at this resort as part of a business incentive trip. I was very impressed with the grounds including the friendliness of the staff and how clean the grounds were. The room we stayed in was a little dated but the bed was super comfortable so I had no problem getting a good night's sleep. What I really enjoyed the most was the array of art on the grounds and in the breeze ways between buildings. It really made the hotel special. I would stay here again. ", " Took my 3 kids for our first ever family vacation. This far exceeded our expectations. Breathtakingly beautiful setting, tons of kid's activities and friendly staff. My kids loved the snorkeling by waterfall and movies at night by the pool. I enjoyed having a safe place for them to have a great time. ", " This is not the most luxurious or naturally beautiful resort, but it's arguably the most ambitious. The lobby is connected to three hotel buildings and a conference center by train and boat service. The pool and (man-made) beach complex are built around a small bay that lets the ocean into the site. We spent a week for a conference and some vacationing, and seemed to discover a new clever aspect of the design or engineering every day.Our room in the \"ocean tower\" was spacious but somewhat drab, with great vistas both toward Mauna Loa and across the property toward the ocean (though it was not priced as having an \"ocean view\"). I gather there is a renovation project in progress that has reached the other towers first, but we didn't think the room was as important as the surroundings. The integration of the building into the other elements of the resort is really well done and makes for a comfortable stay.There are plenty of good choices for food, all more or less expensive. We enjoyed the pools though we would have preferred more shade; there are a limited number of cabanas for rent (and they are not cheap). When you're ready to get out to see the Big Island (or look for more economical food) there's a car rental agency in the resort, and a number of tours pick up there. I would look at other hotel locations if you're going to be out sightseeing every day, but given that I had a conference right at the resort and that we wanted to relax as well as sightsee afterwards, the setting was ideal. ", " I first visited Hilton Waikoloa with my employers Presidents Club trip. I returned with my family to enjoy Dolphin Quest. I called for day use of the resort before and after the Dolphin Quest experience. Upon arrival I was happily surprised to be given a room to use from 10am to 6pm. Dolphin Quest was fantastic. My wife and daughter also enjoyed a spa treatment while me my son's and I enjoyed the pools. My wife and I also snorkeled in the lagoon. I have become quite the fan of Hilton. ", " had a family holiday with 8 of us enjoying 8 days on this island, great rooms on the eighth floor at the ocean towers part of the complex, the swimming facilities were amazing and the walks around the village were eyeopening,we also travelled to the volcano which was very popular looking at the amount of sightseers that were there it was well worth the visit, on another day we went snorkelling on an organised tour which included morning tea and a barbeque lunch, we were gone about 6 hours and had a wonderful time, all in all we had a very relaxing time on the first part of our holiday and are now looking forward to our 2nd part of our holiday on wakiki ", " I was here in Kona for 5 days on business trip. But I only spent 24 hours at the Hilton. Which was too bad for me....stayed in an amazing room all the way in the front right tower by the ocean...what a view from the room. The hotel property is huge..has an electric train that takes you around the place! Has several pools, spots for kids and even a dolphin experience in the hotel property! great gym, good food and bars on property and close to everything...need to come back AGAIN with the family....BUT be warned Hawaii is expensive..thats everywhere ", " This was our first time in the Big Island, and I must say this resort was outstanding & huge! Plenty to see and do for all ages, after 5 days, we still needed more time to get through everything! Very friendly staff and service. ", " This was our (wife and I) third trip to the Hilton Waikoloa. We spent our week mainly at the resort relaxing and taking in the sun. We had a partial ocean view, King size room and nice bathroom. Nothing fancy but nice enough. Only negative was the birds at night, they sing a lot. Make sure to request ear plugs from house keeping. We booked the Hilton all inclusive plan only available to Diamond members. This was well worth the price of admission. It included breakfast daily, 3 course dinner (at all restaurants on site), resort charges, King size room and ALL ADULT BEVERAGES. We enjoyed all the amenities and the pool area is spectacular. This is a huge resort and they offer multiple ways to get around. Our preferred choice was to walk, but you can take a train or boat to get from point a to b. If your on a budget you might think about other options, if not this is the place. Check in and kick back and enjoy the week. If you get bored with the resort you can rent a car from National (on site) and explore the island. I'll be back in Spring of 2017.... ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village is a very nice property. the room was spacious and clean. we had a view of the golf course and ocean. the walk to get to our room was very long. they do offer a monorail (shuttle) or a boat ride but they are very slow. walking will get you there faster but you will be out of breath by the time you get there. we went to one of the pools and did not have a problem getting a chair. we did not try to go to the lagoon beach, it was always crowded. this hotel does not have a sandy beach. there are rocky areas but no sand. that was a bit of a disappointment. ", " This is my second time visiting this resort with family. Another amazing stay! This time we stayed in the same presidential suite in the Palace Tower. It had been renovated since the last stay. Everything looks brand new and the decor is updated. I appreciated the redone kitchen area. Things I missed were the grand piano in the living room area and the sauna and washing machine in the bathrooms. It still was an amazing suite though! The resort is beautiful and there are countless things to do to keep you busy. You will do a ton of walking to get to things, but it's nice they have the trains and boats if you want to take a break. It's Hawaii, so things will be expensive everywhere. I had the pleasure of being treated to lunch at the Lagoon Grill (by dolphin quest) by Hilton's Director of Marketing Communications at the resort. The food everywhere was great! The views were amazing from the lanai of our suite - it was nice watching the sunset every evening. During our stay there was a film crew filming a kid's competition show, Paradise Run, around the resort. They actually did some filming in the suite right below us. I would definitely recommend staying here when in The Big Island! ", " We have visited every Hawaiian island with our kids (including Disney's Aulani) and this was my children's favorite for sure. Our kids are ages 14,12,10. They loved the waterfall pools, hot tubs, Dolphin Quest and especially the protected lagoon where we were able to snorkel, kayak and longboard with many sea turtles daily. So fun!We were offered an upgrade upon arrival to move to the Makai Tower (which is MUCH closer to the parking lot, pools and lagoon). We loved the tower (awesome to have a large vanity and double sinks in the bathroom) but then upon check out were charged twice the amount for the upgrade that we were quoted on check in. This was very upsetting and they refused to honor the original quote that made us upgrade in the first place. So if they offer an upgrade at check in.....get it in writing! My husband is still very upset about this. It was so dishonest and left us feeling disappointed with the resort.We loved that they gave us a phone number to text with any questions or requests. We used this daily for extra blankets, questions about the resort etc. Be warned that this is a huge resort. If you book the ocean tower you have a really long walk to everything the resort offers. Yes they offer cool transportation, but it is really, really slow and doesn't get you to the pools, lagoon anyway without an additional long walk.Over all, we would recommend this resort to other families, just be aware that you do not have access to a beach with waves to boogyboard etc like other Hawaii resorts, but the incredible pools make up for it. ", " Awesome hotel for a resort holiday by the pool. We stayed here for two days during our Hawaiian islands roundtrip July 2016. While I didn't want to stay here for a longer time a couple of days were really great. Clean, super fun and beautiful resort. ", " This was my second trip to this location, and I can foresee returning yet again. The property is gorgeous and there are many places to just sit and relax.The front lobby staff seemed to be a little inattentive to guest, but everywhere else on the property, the staff was very nice.The only things missing that would have kept me at the resort (short of sightseeing) are a movie theater and bowling alley. ", " the grounds were so fancy with tons of art and statues and they have a monorail, boats to get you around the huge complex. The food is a bit pricey if you can get a package with all the food included it might be worth it ($ 32.00 breakfast each person). But their are some good restaurants near the hotel. ", " I've been there last year and found a perfect place for relaxing and enjoying the Hawaiian life. Hard to leave and almost impossible to go back to ordinary life after few days there. Lagoon is great and all the resort restaurants and bars are great to enjoy and recharge from the hard working days. ", " We stayed in the Makai/Lagoon tower and the service was exceptional. Starting with our personal check in spot and front desk front man, Edward. He took very good care of us and made sure we had everything we needed...he definitely went above and beyond. Our room was clean and comfortable. The pools and slides are lots of fun. It was the most crowded I've ever seen it there but that could be because of the Tropical Storm and guests not wanting to be out and about. We visit this resort a couple of times a year and will keep coming back! ", " It was a grand stay! Everything at your finger tips! Learned how to play the ukelele, make leis, and learned how to hulu dance came with our stay!Took train to other part of hotels! Great food! Our view was excellent and swimming with the dolphins we could see from our room! Just great time! ", " The private natural salt water lagoon made this hotel a HUGE hit w/ my 2 pre-teen boys. Snorkeled EVERY morning w/ turtles, fish, eel, etc. Reserve a room that includes the FREE Big Island Breakfast! This morning buffet is a must for any family w/ kids and one of the best we've ever had world-wide! Fresh fruit, fresh island juices, omelet station, meat/egg station, pastry station, fresh fish, cereal station...lots of local, good food. We would do breakfast every morning and then a dinner between 4-6pm each evening -- great value! Location is great for weather / airport travel and being close to daily excursions...but honestly, if you stay in the hotel for a couple days, there is PLENTY to do! Enjoy! ", " This was my first trip to Big Island and my first stay at Hilton Resort. I can't say enough how pleased I am that I chose Hilton Waikola. My 8 year old daughter had so much fun.I always do a lot of research before my trips. I looked into many hotels at Kona, waikola and the only reason I chose Hilton was for my kid. But my husband and I had so much fun too. The pools, water slide, dolphins, the train ride, the boat ride, the walk in the resort, the breakfast buffet by the lake and the list goes on.But I must thank the front desk associate 'Kalehua' who made my stay memorable. When I arrived, she greeted us with a big smiile and was so welcoming. I told her it as my first stay at Hilton and she did everything to make sure I get the best out of my stay. She spent a lot of time getting me a great room at Palace Tower ( this tower is the best! hands down.). I had a partial ocean view room. She is really good at taking care of the guests.I thank her for everything she did and I am sure to go back to Hilton. Thank you Kalehua for making my trip a memorable one. ", " We booked this in March when they offered a 72-hour all-inclusive sale. It is not exactly \"all-inclusive\" but was very good. The package included our room, unlimited drinks, parking, the resort charge, and breakfast and dinner every day. One of the dinner options was a luau, which we went to and enjoyed. It was an overall good value. Please note that you do have to pay 15% gratuity on all purchases with this package, which can add up depending on what you buy. Our breakfast for two gratuity was approximately $10/day, drinks for two was $4, etc. Lines were long at check-in and check-out, but the staff were friendly and helpful. Upon arrival, we were offered an upgrade in our room for $20/night to a Makai room in the Lagoon tower, which we took. I am glad that we did because our view was beautiful! We could see the dolphins, the ocean, a pool, and a huge checkers board which was fun to watch. Upon confirming our upgrade, we were each given Hawaiian leis and escorted to our room with a little tour along the way. That was a nice touch and exactly how I imagined being greeted in Hawaii! The Makai benefits are not really great, but we did get to sit in a special seating area by the pool with padded chairs. To get to the seating area, walk over the rope bridge and go to the left and down the stairs. It is near the KPC restaurant. Sit in the chairs in the back row by the stairs for your best chance at shade during the early afternoon. We were also given water at check-in and daily in our room.I will review the restaurants separately, but we did enjoy the food at this hotel. We had a ton of leftover pizza one day, which we put in our refrigerator, but did not have a microwave to re-heat it. We read reviews that stated that there is a $30 charge for a microwave, so we never asked for one, but in hindsight, I think we should have checked. We had cold pizza once then tossed the rest, which was such a waste of good pizza! We did a bit of walking to get to the restaurants, but there is a tram and a boat available.The parking was a bit of a walk from the rooms, so plan accordingly. The Makai rooms are clean and up-to-date. Our rooms were usually cleaned by noon and there was a comment card where we could leave requests. The bed was comfortable and there was a TV and blu ray player. We regularly sat outside on the balcony to enjoy the view. We were warned about the birds making noise at 4am, but could not hear this from our room (6322).Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this resort. We received great service throughout our stay. I would highly recommend it, particularly if you can book during the all-inclusive sale. It was a great value. If we had not gone during the sale, we would most likely have tried to leave the resort to eat as the meals were quite expensive. However, there don't seem to be too many other places around to eat, so I am not sure where exactly we would have gone. I am glad that we did the all-inclusive package! ", " Love coming to this resort! It is great for families or a romantic getaway. There are several pools and to choose from, including an adults only pool and pools with waterslides. We especially loved the onsite lagoon that offers a unique Hawaiian experience, where you can snorkel and see the beautiful tropical fish and sea turtles; and use a stand up paddle board, peddle boat, kayak, or bicycle boat. You and/or your child can also partake in the dolphin quest. Or you can just lay around an isolated area of the resort and relax or take a stroll along the resort's paths. The children enjoyed using the boats and tram to get to their rooms. The resort is huge and walking around allows you to appreciate all the the flora and fauna as well, including their very own macaws and flamingos. This resort makes it hard to leave and explore the island. Will definitely return! ", " It was everything we expected. High standard of service and very family-friendly. The layout and design of this resort was well thought-off. It's huge but didn't mind the long walks with all the hundreds of art pieces displayed all over. It is indeed within a village so there are nearby restos and a well-stocked supermarket that offered cooked meals too (though as one would expect, prices are a bit higher than your regular supermarket). ", " Family had a wonderful time. Dinner at KPC was GREAT. Keith our server gave us great recommendations and we went back for dinner once more before we left the hotel. Dinner at Imari was SUPER. We had dinner there 2 nights as well. Servers MJ and Bita were great and we felt special to be on their table. ", " We were there for a weekend before moving on to a condo. Great for a short trip. We were in the Makai tower overlooking the lagoon, in an upgraded room. The room was great, if dated a bit. Lots of space. WiFi in the room was crap.This is a great resort. Pools are fabulous, especially with the waterfall and big slide. The art on display throughout the resort is gorgeous. Service great. It is very spendy, and the tipping can get overwhelming. Breakfast options are sadly lacking. The breakfast buffet was too spendy for what my kids eat (would have been $120+), but we ended up spending $80 at the coffee shop on pastries and drinks for 4! Lunch at the pool is good. KPC is great for dinner. Getting your car in/out of the lot was time-consuming and expensive.Ocean Sports runs the water activities and the Cabanas. We reserved a covered cabana pre-arrival, and it was worth the money! $225 for the full day, and it was the cabana with curtains (essentially a King-size bed), unlimited fresh water for our family of 4, refreshing face towels, and food-service. It also included a fruit tray, some chips, a bag, and one full hour of rentals from Ocean Sports (we did SUP). The ability to get out of the sun, but still enjoy the ocean view and pool view was fabulous. This was a great place for two-days. I think it would become much too expensive for more time there. Pool overlooked the ocean, so you cannot beat the views! ", " This resort is on another level trains, boats amazing pools, hot tubs and dolphins. They have transformed a lava field into a lush paradise. Service is always top natch and they have some fantastic restaurants in the area as well. ", " This is a 5-star hotel in my book! The staff, rooms, and resort are all outstanding! Whether you are solo, with family and/or friends, I highly recommend the Waikoloa Hilton - there is something there for everyone. The walking/jogging trails are surprisingly filled with fauna and wildlife among the lava rock. I will return there at some point and will plan on staying at least two weeks. Aloha! Christa M. ", " We had a great time and great service. Our best meal was at the Boat Landing Cantina. Ocean tower with a view was a plus. Staff was friendly and helpful. I was able to use my Hilton points very easily during prime tourist season for a great room with a view of the ocean and entire resort ", " Best resort in any of the Hawaiian Islands. We go there every 3 years. Very reasonably priced. Great place for families and reconnect.I swam with turtles in their lagoon every day that I was day. Don't even bother with any other resort on the island. ", " Spent 2 nights, 3 days at the Hilton Waikoloa and was fortunate to experience most of the property and its amenities. Staff friendly and helpful; you can either take the tram or enjoy the walk around the property. Lots to do - family friendly. Shopping is close to property - there's even a grocery store. ", " We have been here four times already, kids just love it! Dolphins, sea turtle, stand up paddle board, tram, boats, breath taking view....everything is great, we will visit again and again!!! This is perfect for families. ", " Thank you Hilton team for making my stay a memorable one. My daughter is in heaven with so many activities onsite: lagoons, large pools, boat ride, seeing dolphins and flamingos without leaving the property. It is a great hotel for families. ", " My husband and I stayed here for three nights while he had a work conference, before flying to Maui for a week. It was a beautiful and relaxing place. We did not need to leave the resort. There was a monorail or boat to take you from one side of the resort to the other. We preferred walking...lots of walking. The views were amazing. The lagoon was nice for snorkeling. We saw fish and sea turtles. There were many pools. We were lucky enough to have a room near the adult pool. Although I love Maui, if we were to return to Kona, this would be the place to stay. ", " Over all would recommend :) Only small bumps, 2 hour check in from valet to room, due to only one person checking people in, room felt damp and smelled musty. Other than than that we had a grade A experience. I would surely go back if we can. It is a beautiful resort, the staff is amazing, the grounds are stunning. ", " They gouge you every step of the way. 4 burgers 4 beers were $140 for lunch. A soda, 2 candy bars, 3 cans of Hawaiian sun and a 4 pack of mini wine bottles was almost $60 at the dancing Dolphins. Don't forget $30 a day to park your rental car. They hound you into taking a 90 minute property tour. Phone calls didn't stop for 3 days...in the room and on your cell. Wake up calls were 3 of 4. Too expensive for the hassle. ", " We visited here with my family on my sons Make a Wish trip. All of our accommodations were set up in advance by Make a Wish so we were not sure of what to expect upon our arrival. The resort is beautiful and all of the staff was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Would most definitely stay here again. ", " Absolutely amazing experience! My wife and I vacationed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort for our anniversary and it did not disappoint us! We were there the end of June through the first week of July which of course included the 4th of July holiday. The entire experience was incredible.Parking was very accessible and easy to use. We used self parking and everything worked well. The one opportunity is during the holiday non-resort users crowd the self parking lot and it can be difficult to find spots during those times. Otherwise, there are several unique restaurants on the property and there are many amenities available. The Big Breakfast restaurant was awesome and the pizza spot (Don and Toni's?) was really good also.We are from Philly by way of the South and we were very pleased with the hospitality, the cleanliness of the property, and attention to detail by the entire team.Note: This was our first time in HI and it is indeed true that you should go prepared $$!!Otherwise, great location! ", " what a wonderful experience to have with my family! Vanessa at the restaurant took care of us every morning and started our day incredibly! we then went to the pool where vicki made sure our chairs were tended to. loved the breakfast, pools, and excellent staff. special thanks to the valet for being so prompt! ", " This large Hilton resort has three distinct hotels on the property with a single reception area, and other lodging available just back from the coast. The hotels are in close proximity to each other, and to all of the other amenities and facilities, including multiple pools, but are also connected by an electric train and by a boat that travels on its own waterway. As well as a variety of pools available for all ages, there is swimming in a lagoon connected to the sea, where fish are abundant and turtles can often be seen. Despite its size, the resort did not feel crowded whenever we visited from our lodging at the HGVC on the property. Shopping is available, along with several restaurants, at two centers within the resort. Hard to beat for those who want an all-in-one-place relaxing vacation, but also suitable for those who want days trips out and a comfortable place to spend their nights and occasional days. ", " Our first time in Hawaii. We first went to Maui and then we came to the big island. All I have to say is wow. Beautiful property, stayed In the Maki suite with the dolphin view. Loved every minute of this vacation. I high recommend :). Good shopping very close by. ", " The hotel and grounds are gorgeous. Every restaurant serves superb meals there are so many activities for the entire family. The staff is very knowledgeable and more than willing to help. The sunsets are to die for! ", " This was our first time visiting the \"Big Island\" of Hawaii, and we enjoyed staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village!We took advantage of a hotel rate that was slightly more expensive than the normal rate but included free breakfast at Water's Edge. Anyone can find something to eat at this buffet. There were eggs, bacon, an omelette station, local favorites (i.e., kalua pork and purple sweet potatoes), yogurt, fresh fruit, grilled fish, many varieties of bread, and even traditional Japanese breakfast foods. It was a great start to the morning! Also, if and when you eat at Water's Edge for breakfast, request to have Vanessa as your server- she is fantastic! She is very attentive, is always smiling, and gets to know you on a personal level. She memorized our beverage orders every morning and made sure that our cups were always filled with delicious Kona coffee and tea! Even if we did not enjoy the food offered at breakfast, Vanessa's service would have made the daily trip to Water's Edge worth it!We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and had a Makai-level room, which included complimentary Wi-Fi and access to the spa. We did not have time to go to the spa during our visit, but based on our perceptions of it from the outside, it appeared to be very nice. Next time, we will certainly pay a visit! The room was spacious, and we had a nice veranda on which we enjoyed viewing the dolphins below and the stars at night. We were also given complimentary water bottles each day, which was a nice bonus. The hotel room also came with a fridge, which was convenient to have for snacks and drinks. There were several pools that guests can visit. The main pool near the Lagoon Tower was very large and had a water slide, a waterfall, and even a shallow area for young children. Makai guests also have a special section reserved for them at this pool with comfortable lounge chairs. The pool attendants were great; they constantly asked if we needed anything to drink or if we needed our towels to be replaced. Special shout out to Vicky, who is extremely friendly and always made sure that we were taken care of! Also, there are a few seats with palapa-style umbrellas near the lagoon in which guests can snorkel. There were huge sea turtles in the lagoon, and you can even view them from a platform above the lagoon if snorkeling does not appeal to you. Stand-up paddle boards and kayaks were also able to be rented. The property is huge, but the Hilton does a nice job of offering a wide variety of ways to get around the resort. Our family loves to walk, so we walked everywhere we went. They also have a tram and a boat service that both give guests the option to move about the resort. On our walks around the resort, we were able to view artifacts from China, Japan, and Polynesia and learn about them, thanks to Hilton's initiative to educate guests on different cultures. The \"museum\" was very impressive, and it was well worth the time to view all of the artifacts.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. There is plenty of activities to enjoy, and the resort was beautiful. We will certainly be back! ", " We will be visiting the property later this July- so far, Executive Chef Hans Lentz gets 5 stars! My 8 year old daughter has Celiac Disease. Before booking, I spoke with many different hotel's chefs. Fabulous Chef Hans of the Hilton was the most knowledgeable about Celiac's needs; He has assigned a \"personal chef\" to tend to my daughter's meals when we visit- we have been given the Chef's cell phone number, contact info, and Accommodations are in place. I can tell you a couple of the other island!'s kitchens weren't as receptive to her needs- you can't just throw a gluten free bun on a burger and serve a celiac, and Hilton Chef knows this!). I Will post when my trip is complete, but as of now the Hilton gets 5 stars from this mom!! ", " We love this resort. It is in a great location and the amenities are very good. It is close to hapuna beach (white sand beach ) and to a black sand beach also. It is very close to blue Hawaiian helicopters which is a must do in Hawaii. Staff is friendly. It was great ", " Staying at this hotel was paradise. The staff is very attentive and courteous. All our needs were met and the variety of outdoor activities was amazing. Definitely would recommend this place to friends & family. ", " I've stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village 8 times, for a total of 44 nights in all, over the span of several years. However, this review is based off of my experiences during my last trip, for the most part.First off, the pools are slightly dirty but so much fun, and never as crowded as expected, which is nice. The water slides are great and the staff manning the slides are very safety-conscience and friendly. The pools are enjoyable to people of all ages!The restaurants I've eaten at (Kirin, Orchid Marketplace, Dona & Tony's pizza, Waikoloa Coffee Company) are all tasty. They are expensive but that's to be expected at a resort.On this trip, we stayed in the Ocean Tower, room 3070, which had perfect views of the ocean, Buddha Point, and the sunset. The room was clean and spacious. The patio was comfortable, and we even ate dinner out there once or twice. The wifi in the room was slow and unreliable. However, there are SO many other activities offered, that slow wifi shouldn't be much of an issue, since you probably won't be spending much time in your room.The resort is huge, and a tram and boat are offered as alternatives to walking. Walking is sometimes quicker and more scenic, but the tram is air-conditioned, which feels so nice after walking around on a hot day, and there's plenty of room to bring luggage aboard. The boat provides a nice way to see the resort, especially at night, when it's very peaceful. The water that the boats travel in is pretty gross; it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months. But, there are many types of interesting fish to look at. As a side note, the hotel is absolutely stunning, and decorated beautifully, with gorgeous art and statues around the grounds.I did Dolphin Quest every time I came here until I got too old, but I still remember the wonderful times I had; it's truly such a unique experience and I strongly recommend it.The lagoon has many different types of fish, which makes it perfect for snorkeling. You can also rent paddle-boards, kayaks, etc., to use in the lagoon. The water is very clear, which makes it easy to see the wildlife under the water.There was a movie playing in the Kona pool from 7-10 the night we arrived, but we didn't know what movie was playing, so we called down and asked what it was. After a long time on the phone, we still didn't get an answer, so we just hung up. I would strongly suggest implementing a better system for guest phone calls.Overall, this resort is absolutely incredible. It has it's cons, but the positives of staying here heavily outweigh the negatives. In my opinion, this is the greatest resort, by far, on the Big Island. Perfect for families, couples, or anyone looking to have a relaxing, enjoyable Hawaiian vacation. I will never forget the incredible times I had, and will always consider this resort a home away from home. ", " We had an Oceanfront room with a stunning view. The grounds are magnificent. The restaurants are outstanding. The amenities are exceptional. The employees are wonderful. From check in to check out, every Hilton associate we dealt with was pleasant, courteous, helpful and kind. We had a fabulous time and we were sad to leave. The only down point is the Grand Vacations time share sales pitch. ", " Stayed 3 nights at this great resort. We have stayed at some nice places & this is now at our top. From the train to the boat, from the room to the great views, from the service to cleanliness, everything was perfect. Wonderful for familys or honeymooners. ", " Spent 10 days here at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I've stayed at many Hiltons and been to many countries around the world but I can tell you honestly this was the best 10 day holiday i've taken in my entire life.No need to hire a car. We got a ride from the airport. Stayed on-property for the entire time and never for 1 moment ran out of things to do! Snorkeling, dolphin experience, turtle watching, swimming, eating at several different restaurants as well as room service. Got a great room that we loved. Had it sprinkled with rose petals before arrival for the romance. Gondola rides around the resort, train rides around the resort. Cabanas by the ocean. Non stop exploring. This place is truly amazing. I hope they keep up the maintenance and keep this place in top condition as its truly a great experience. If you like the pools and water, go for the Lagoon tower. If you can afford it, go for a MAKAI One Bedroom Suite! Really enjoyed it. :-) ", " Hilton Waikoloa has always been one of my favorite resorts. Unfortunately, because of work and such, I haven't been able to visit for over a decade. This time I was able to bring my husband with me and it was just as good as I remembered. We loved the pools and lagoon. The food was delicious!! The cocktail drinks were a bit expensive, and I'm not sure they put much alcohol in them, but they were all delicious. The staff were all very friendly. The resort was so clean and well maintained for such a large area. I would definitely recommend this resort, especially for families. We are going back as soon as we can!! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is a great property, do not let the size fool you, it is easy to get around and they had a lot of activities to keep you busy. I do recommend the Wakai option for better pool seats and rooms and discounts. Wei will go back. My wife also did the Dolphin encounter and she will also remember that. ", " Spent 7 nights here with family including 2 kids ages 12 and 13. Something for everyone! Pools were great, dining options varied and property is well maintained. Dolphin Quest is a must and conveniently located on hotel grounds. Convenient to near-by beaches and shopping center. Rooms in the Makai Tower is a must. I have been to other islands and resorts in Hawaii and this was a great value for my money. ", " We spent a week at the Waikoloa, (family of 4 with 2 teens) and had a fantastic time! From check in, to check out, the experience was top notch. We did trade up to the Makai level, so had a new room in the closest tower to most of the fun. And the unlimited towels you can get at the pool, with the Makai level, practically made it worth it to me. We really took advantage of just about everything on property...ate at the resort every day, got a star card for water toy rental, took lessons at the tennis club, worked out at gym, rented cabanas (big & small), snuba'd, did Dolphin Quest, did the Luau, got services at the Spa, shopped, rented DVDs & games, and mini golfed, AND golfed at the next door property golf course....and ALL were just excellent - what a great week! My only complaint is that the Makai concierge at our tower continually tried to talk us into going to a Grand Vacations sales pitch. I am sure they are awesome, but enough already! I highly recommend this resort. ", " It has been years since I last stayed at this hotel. I was very pleased with my stay and the staff at the hotel were amazingly helpful. I will definitely be back to this hotel in the future. The amenities are awesome and there are so many fun filled activities for children. Hilton Waikoloa Village is the way to go if you're planning a family vacation. ", " This is a large, beautiful property with a host of amenities...and some unique quirks. Overall it is a terrific property, if you know how to make it work for you! The size of the property presents a great selection of activities and kept our family of 5 interested and active for a full week. There's a selection of pools, outdoor areas, and views for whatever you feel like doing that day. Service staff are very accommodating, and obviously the location is amazing. A couple of unique quirks to mention. The property is quite large, so you're either going to walk a lot, or find yourself waiting for the tram or boat. That didn't bother us because we were expecting it, and we even came to enjoy it. However, if you're expecting to ride the elevator directly down to the pool, you're going to be in for a surprise. The dinner options get really slim after 5 pm, especially for a casual family meal. There's essentially two casual restaurants open after 5 - one italian themed, and one mexican themed. The fine dining restaurant (KPC) is terrific, but not somewhere a family wants (or can afford) to eat every night. We would have liked to have had a casual, family option with a broader menu on a number of nights. However, you can rent a microwave for $30 total for your entire stay so that's a great option for families - either for leftovers or for offsite grocery shopping. One of our party is gluten free - two things to note about that. First, the staff is very gluten free conscious and the options are decent. However, the tip is that the kitchen will gladly prepare whatever gluten free items you want and deliver them to any of the restaurants with a bit of advance notice. Once we learned that, our experience really changed. The final quirk is more about the big island than the resort - and that is to say that everything is spread out across the island, so carefully evaluate whether you want/need to rent a car. The resort and the shopping area a short shuttle ride away are great, but if you want to see anything else on the island you're going to need a car. We rented a car for one day to see the volcanoes and the rest of the island and took a taxi back and forth to a nighttime manta ray snorkel so we didn't miss having easy access to a car. If you're a family that wants to shop for food off property (either to save $$ or for a broader selection), or like to explore the local surroundings like Kona, the public beaches, or are going to snorkel/dive or golf off property a car for the duration of your stay is a necessity. ", " Friendly, clean, outstanding customer service! Room was comfortable, clean and spacious. Ground and pool was well kept. We visit the location twice per year to relax and enjoy the pool. Front desk very helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was very accommodating to our request. ", " This hotel is great, especially if you have kids. Not exactly where you want to go for a romantic get away or peace and quiet. Our teenagers loved it though! So much to do, lots of different activities and places to eat. Our room had a spectacular view and we were able to watch fireworks from our balcony on 4th of July. This is our second time staying at the Waikaloa Hilton. ", " We had an amazing time at this resort! Easy check-in and escort to our room with a personal orientation to point out ways to make our stat more enjoyable. Our room was in the lagoon tower on the second floor overlooking the pool and the ocean. Every morning I sat on the balcony drinking fresh kona coffee ;from the kiosk outside our room, while listening to the gentle break of the waves below. I never tired of this!! Serene and peaceful. The grounds, pools, lagoons all impeccably clean. We loved walking the grounds and seeing the Dolphins playing with the trainers, the sea life on display in the lagoon and waters throughout the property. Just beautiful.We ate at Imari one evening and found it delicious but too humid to really relax and enjoy our meal. It is an open air restaurant and no air conditioning is felt while dining near sunset.We also tried the cantina and had the nachos and a margarita. Expensive but good and plenty to share for two. Maybe one of our favorite meals was at the grill, enjoying a really delicious cheeseburger and watching the Dolphins.One negative experience was participating in the timeshare presentation. If it's not for you, they suddenly are no longer nice and we were literally kicked to the curb, told that a ride was on the way but..... We had to ask for a ride again after waiting another 15 min. Live and learn they say!So lets wind this up on a good note. We loved this property and would go back in a heart beat! Can't say enough wonderful things about the stay! And PS the walking is not bad at all if you choose the lagoon tower everything is convenient and when not, take the tram or boat for a change of pace. Aloha Hawaii until we meet again! ", " My wife left rested, and the kids tried. Perfect vacation. Its a big property so get comfy shoes and slippers (flip-flops). If you don't plan on leaving much don't rent a car, just takes tours because the property and close shops have everything you need. ", " Stayed four nights at this resort. Resort was nice with great amenities nearby. It was quit the drive to anything outside of the resort. However, there was decent shopping and dining, but mostly just mainland chains. ", " Loved every part of his resort. My only complaint is that in the seven days we were there there wasn't enough time to do everything. Great pool and the lagoon was a great bonus. We went for the Kona half marathon so packet pickup was really easy as we're staying at the hotel. Loved the tram and the boat to get around after the race. Room was very comfortable. We were in the Makai tower on the second level and the view was fantastic over the lagoon, dolphin quest and the ocean in the background. Our highlight within the resort was going to dolphin quest. It was a fantastic experience that my 14 year old daughter and I loved I would definitely recommend it. Special thanks to the valet parking boys for always bringing our car up so quickly and being very helpful and friendly. Overall a fantastic stay! ", " My family of 52 adults, children & grandparents spent a four day weekend at the Hilton Waikoloa the first weekend in June. The hotel offers so much to do that we didn't have to leave the property. Our room was located in the Ocean Tower ground floor facing the ocean! It's a little sketchy getting down there, but once you open the front door you are in your happy place!The Big Kahuna Breakfast was the best deal ever and a fantastic way for us to regroup in the morning before heading to the pools all day. From the omelet station to the fruit bar, there is much more food there than you can try in a week.Love it! ", " My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Hilton and we were very pleased with our room, the service, and the resort. The accommodations, property and staff were wonderful. Our ocean front room had a magnificent view and the room was very quiet. Our bed was extremely comfortable and conducive to a great night's sleep. I appreciated the complimentary spa products in the room: soaps, shampoo, etc. Everything was clean and fresh throughout the property. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The train and boat service make it easy to get around the huge property. I would definitely like to return in the future and bring the rest of the family. ", " How many hotels have a giant man mad waterfall that plunges into a stunning reef-pool containing all sorts of tropical fish, dolphins and turtles. This place is everything Hawaiian and so much more. Amazing shopping, a golf course to die on, and everything you would expect from the Hilton Hotel chain... well done conrad!! ", " Easy but lengthy drive from Kona airport to the resort. Thank goodness for cell phone GPS because it was dark and the road was not well lighted. The self parking area is a good walk to the front desk area. I am very happy to have opted for valet service to delivery our suitcases. While the tram service was operational, the resort is so large that it would have been too stressful trying to find our room and pulling several suitcases. The next morning we tried their pricey but good and plentiful breakfast buffet. Our room was quiet, clean and well appointed. We shopped at Costco for snack foods and a case of bottle water. ", " When we come to the big Island we always try and stay at least one night at the Hilton. We have stayed at the resort twice and always discover something new. If you have kids under 7 then the lagoon tower is the way to go. If you have kids a bit older than that ocean tower is the way to go. Food is expensive so bring your own snacks and drinks. ", " I highly recommend this village whatever your age! Is very nice, efficient and well organized. You feel like being in the paradise. Here you will find everything you need, from services to amusement attractions. The village is entirely surrounded by greenery and the landscape the village overlooks is very impressive and you can walk on a trail along the sea. We also took part in the Luau, the entertainment was exciting and the food very good. In addition, the village is kept very clean, both inside the rooms and outside. If you have time, I also suggest to try the restaurant Kamuela Provision Company, one of the most romantic in the world! ", " If you are looking to go to the Big Island, you need to stay here. Beautiful property with so many activities to do that you will want to spend more time at this resort, which we did. Four pools, salt water cove area that you can swim, paddle board, snorkel in to see sea turtles and fish, plus a great golf course! Also, the staff always had a smile and very helpful. ", " Want to visit a hotel that by itself embodies the best of Hawaii contained within its walls? Then the Hilton Wikoloa Village Hotel is worth the trip. From the friendly hotel staff, to the multi-acre property with lagoons, meeting rooms, spa, swimming pools, beaches, monorail system and shops, this was indeed worth the visit. Stunning views and enjoyable walking paths along the property, this Hilton is well worth your time! ", " The service from the valet to the check-in and the stay and departure were all 5 star and amazing with so much aloha every where! The grounds... the activities...are truly paradise! It is worth every penny and I plan to be back next June!!! The experience is a dream and even the beds are so awesome...everything is just perfect and everywhere we went we were greeting with the feeling of aloha! Mahalo:)! ", " Words can't describe how much I loved this hotel. The room was a great size and had the most beautiful view of the ocean. The grounds were immaculate. This resort is huge. We were able to get around by walking, train or boat. There were many restaurants and they were all wonderful. Looking forward to staying here again. ", " This resort is beautiful, great walking paths throughout the resort and along the ocean. The lagoon is fabulous for young kids with great options for water rentals. The pools were amazing and it never seemed very crowded. Easy to get around by tram or boat, which was everyone's favorite!! Save money by stocking up at the nearby grocery stores or eating at restaurants off site. We had a great time and were never bored!! ", " Just like other Hilton, expensive, old, cold and beautiful, huge property, location, view of the ocean is incredible, stunning, territory like an theme park. Service is nice. Relaxing, bot boring. Good for couple only, not recommend it for family or group of friends. ", " Kids loved every part of the hotel. So many things to do without leaving hotel which is quite rare. Dolphin experience was the highlight of trip. Kids didn't want to leave. Restaurants kind of expensive but there is a shopping complex right next door ", " Hilton always sets a high standard but Waikoloa goes above and beyond. Our room was perfect, the resort facilities were incredible, and the staff was fantastic, especially the concierge folks!! No request went unfulfilled. We accidentally left something behind when we checked out, and before our flight left the airport, the staff had retrieved it and arranged for mailing it to our next stop in Maui. We can't wait to return to Waikoloa, and highly recommend this resort to all traveling to the Big Island! ", " We are having the time of our lives at the Waikoloa Hilton! The hotel is on a beautiful tropical lagoon by the ocean. Love the art and sculptures and how they are integrated into the landscaping. The food has been excellent. Bed is fabulous. Rooms are super clean and the service has been second to none. Could not be happier. ", " This enormous hotel has everything you'd need. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, Makai connecting rooms for five days. We used Hilton points, so the price was right. When we checked in, we were treated very kindly at the Makai desk. We were given a cool wash cloth, water, and even beautiful purple leis. We think the leis were for our Hilton Honor level on top of the Makai...excellent perk. The Makai benefits were explained to us by Eric who walked us to our room. Every employee we encountered was polite, helpful, and friendly from check-in, to restaurants, valets, and cleaning staff.We did use the special Makai seating area by the Lagoon Pool--new padded chairs were added to this area during our stay. We received bottled water in our rooms daily. Two days my older daughters and I went down to the spa for the tranquility and jetted showers, and one of our daughters used the fitness area--all free Makai perks. We also received $20/day per room vouchers due to Hilton Honors status. Usually there is a $25/day resort fee, but we didn't need to pay it since we used points. Parking was $30/day.The rooms were about average sized with updated d\u00e9cor. We were on the sixth (top) floor. Each room has a balcony with a sliding door and screen door. Our view was \"mountain\", but from there we could see the ocean and even luaus from a distance. The beds were very comfortable and the blackout curtains were fabulous. There is a mini fridge in each room which we used for water, soda, and breakfast foods. We saved money by eating every breakfast and some other meals in the room. Then, we splurged on one meal out a day.We took advantage of the free scheduled classes that are offered. Call right away for reservations. We made flower and nut leis. Had a group hula lesson and a ukulele lesson. You can walk to other buildings or take the tram or boat. We usually walked, but tried them each at different times.The Kona pool area is fantastic as is the lagoon. We brought our own snorkel gear to use in the lagoon rather than rent. We saw fish and even a turtle. Bring an underwater camera! The pool area is large and has many different areas to explore. There's a grotto hot tub, waterfalls, suspension bridge, etc. Shade is hard to come by. Try sitting under the bridge if you've had too much sun. We walked to A Bay from our hotel. Wear good walking shoes. It's not far and there is a lot of shade along the way. The sand there is coarse, but it's an easy beach to get to. ", " Great hotel and great service. You don't have that overcrowded feeling although lots of people are there. it is a large property so it was nice to have the monorail that takes you to various parts of the hotel grounds. It is located close to some nice beaches, restaurants, and sites. You will need a car if you want to see other parts of the island or go into town. I thought the restaurants were overprice, like most big hotels are. The WiFi was extremely slow. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel. ", " Mahalo nui to Ranada! First impressions are so key and she was amazing! So helpful and full of aloha! Our stay at the Hilton was incredible and we can't wait to come back! Dolphin Quest is a must! BeBe and Johna will take great care of you with the dolphins. Aloha! ", " I spent 9 beautiful days at this Hilton, most of which I was working a conference. The hotel staff was awesome, as were the grounds and our room. We stayed in an Ocean Deluxe in the Ocean Tower and our view of the sunset was better than anywhere on the resort. The resort is spread out, making is necessary to use the tram, bus or walk long distances. The walk from the hotel lobby to my room was 16 minutes walking at a good pace. Most of the time we preferred to walk anyway because the view was gorgeous and because the tram and boat could take a long time. The restaurants onsite were very good but expensive. In fact, anything on the resort is expensive but that was to be expected. ", " We spent six great days at the Waikoloa Hilton in Jun and remembered why we always want to come back. I loved the fact that the concierge sent me a text after check-in...i was able to text with them several times during our stay about things that otherwise would have required a visit to the lobby desk... and it is a very busy lobby. We found the Dolphinquest group to be very interactive with guests even if you aren't participating in a dolphin encounter. They answered questions and fed the dolphins regularly near the bridge, more interactive than I remember from a previous visit. The grounds were as beautiful as always, no small feat given the size of the property. Speaking of the size it can take awhile to get from point A to point B. But you know that going in; just remember you're on vacation and turn it into a positive. There are lots of hidden nooks and on the property and the artifacts and artwork are around every corner. They will give you a guide to those items at the front desk if you are interested. I found the staff to be great from top to bottom. In short it was a great stay and my family would return again without a doubt. ", " We spent a week here and still did not see it all. The artwork, flowers, plants, pools and view are beyond beautiful! We upgraded to Makai and it was well worth special seating at the pool and views of the dolphins and beach. ", " Ok, 6th time in Hawaii, 2nd time in Kona. This resort is huge. I still haven't seen in all. The highlights of the resort is the lagoon pool. By far, my favorite. We stayed in the Makai tower. The rooms are nice. Bathrooms are tidy and the landscaping is immaculate which is a standard for all Hilton resorts/properties. We ate at the lounge one night, which played good local music. Food was great and the drinks were even better. Service is top notch also which comes at no surprise. We also ate lunch at the pool bar and service and food was great. If you are a diamond member, there is not an executive lounge or free breakfast. Instead, you get $10.00 voucher per adult, per night to use at the restaurants, pool bars, or coffee shops. Use them all at one time or increments.  I can't complain about anything on this resort except for the walking you will do to get around this place. They have that covered also with the boat and tram system. The eateries close pretty early here so make sure you get the map and look at times and plan accordingly. Attended a luau at royal kona resort about 30 minutes away which was worth the price and the drive. I'm a big shopper and Kona had nothing to offer in terms of shopping especially at the Kings, and Queens marketplace located up the street. I go to Oahu to get my shopping fix. Kona is more of a relaxing spot and this resort offers you relaxation. If you are having cabin fever, I would suggest heading over to Ali'i Drive in Kona. You could spend most of your day there, hit the beach, eat local food and do some local shopping. This resort is secluded. Again, more for relaxation. The waikola beach is just around the corner but you gotta look for the signs... love their beach. Sometimes you just wanna get off the resort especially if you are staying a entire week. Even though you pay to swim with the dolphins, you can still walk by and see them swimming and playing. ", " I always stay at the Hilton Waikoloa whenever I come to the Big Island for work. It is very central to everything. It got more exciting bring my then fiance, now husband, with me to introduce not only the island, but also enjoy the beauty of the hotel. The hotel provided us with everything we needed in terms of basic needs and relaxation. Now we brought our infant daughter with us on her first plane ride, worrying, how she would be...but she did great, and I could tell felt the amazing and peaceful energy that her parents felt when they stayed at Waikoloa. Looking forward to future business and most importantly...family stays here. ", " Stayed five days at the Hilton Waikoloa in early Feb and we had an awesome stay. The hotel facilities were great, plenty of spots to relax and have a few drinks and a bite to eat, Swimming pools and a man-made lagoon running out into the ocean. Spent some extra cash and even jumped in with the dolphins in one of the resort's excellent attractions. Spent most of our vacation just kicking back around the resort and soaking in the laid back, leisurely atmosphere. Staff were totally hospitable and always keen to help out. It was our first time in Hawaii and by the second day, we were totally sold and talking about the next time when we check out Maui and Oahu. Loved the place, the chilled out pace and the 'get away from it all in paradise' lifestyle. Recommend it to anyone who's thinking about and we got a brilliant 'all in' package through Costco travel. Life long memories are made on trips like this one. ", " This is our favorite place to visit. We've never stayed in a bad unit. We travel there almost every year. Great restaurants and stores close by and a plus-- not too far from Costco! Would highly recommend this trip to singles or families. Beautiful beaches not too far. ", " This is a large, sprawling, well maintained resort that has numerous restaurants and great shopping within walking distance. Although they offer a monorail and boat system to transport guests from one area of the resort to another, it is only a 10 to 15 minute walk from one end of the resort to the other. Beautiful beaches are a 5 minute drive away. We stayed in the Ocean Tower, and the views from our room were spectacular. Three negatives - the breakfast is ridiculously expensive. The dolphin lagoon is just sad, I wanted to \"free Willy\" every I walked past it. And finally, cats are all over the resort. They can be seen throughout the day, and heard at night breeding and scratching fleas. I wish the management would spay/neuter the feline residents, and invest in some Frontline flea killer. ", " We stayed here for 5 nights. We chose not to get our rental car until the day of departure. So while we were \"locked\" into the resort, that is kind of the point of a stay like this. Yes, the meals were pricey, but they were generous portions (making it easy to skip lunch) and service was outstanding.We stayed in the Ocean Tower and found the tram and boats easy to use. There is a Disney-esque feel to the place but without the characters and rides. The grounds are extremely well maintained and staff throughout the resort was friendly and helpful.Take a little time to understand the various freebies and the things you have to pay for (some cabanas are reserved for $50 a day and others -just 20 ft away are free.) While there are no actual ocean-front beaches on the Hilton campus, the lagoon swimming area is a charming second-best. There is a trolley that can take guests to the 2 shopping centers just 5 minutes away. ", " Spent a day visiting the lagoon area @ Hilton Village. Dolphin lagoon area right next to restaurant, could've spent a day watching them play on their own and watched them interact with the paying guests. Lagoon area is wonderful, covered cabanas for rent throughout the banks of the lagoon. Very safe swim area for families, saw little kids swim with no worry. Rental boards, kayaks available for use. Great restaurant to have a little gnosh. Daughter brought along a hammock which she strung up between 2 palm trees so that was nice. No need to bring towels as they were available as an amenity to Hilton Club guests. Worth spending at least half day just lounging and hanging out. Off course the views from the lagoon out to the ocean are idyllic. Tranquil day. freshwater pools are also accessible from lagoon area should you wish, so all swimming options open. Nice time. Peace, RCP ", " I stayed here for a conference, and loved this hotel. I would love to go back with my family some day and enjoy some of the amenities like the pool and mini golf course and the cute little two person cabanas looking over the water. If you are staying for a conference, the Palace Tower would probably be the most convenient to the conference center. The Ocean Tower that I chose was a HIKE!Hotel Pros:1. So many things to do to keep a family busy. The pool by the ocean tower was particularly neat with short water slides connecting several pools together. 2. This hotel is humongous, but all the grounds were meticulously manicured. The views were just spectacular. 3. Every staff member I interacted with, especially the valet drivers were extremely friendly. 4. Overall this resort reminded me of being in a Walt Disney World deluxe resort. Some Cons:1. We found three cockroaches in our room. 2. The room was pretty plain, for the price of the hotel I thought it should feel fancier. 3. We probably walked 10 miles just back and forth from the lobby to our Ocean Tower room, it was easily a ten minute brisk walk, but walking was faster than the tram. 4. Prices for food were OUTRAGEOUS!!!! Coffee was $5.50! Breakfast buffet was $32!! We went off site for every meal, and found the grocery store at nearby Queen's Landing to have some excellent budget items. I would never ever stay here without a rental car. Bring lots of singles for the valet! 5. This hotel is really in the middle of nowhere. Expect to take a 30-50 minute drive to get to anything. 6. There is no real sandy beach, just a fake kind of cheesy lagoon area. ", " This is the third time we have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, the second with small children. Wonderful place for youngsters! We had a 19mo and almost 5 year old grandsons with us and they had an absolute blast. The resort was 100% full but the staff handled it very well. I was surprised at how quiet the room was (luck of the draw with neighbors), but we had no trouble getting a table at restaurants or finding pool chairs. I recommend the Lagoon Tower Makai rooms for a central location that is easily walkable from the lobby if you are going to be leaving the resort often, as we did. We have stayed at the Ocean Tower before, and that is a long way from the lobby!This is a fun, huge resort that is a great place to stay with family. My husband and I also stayed here in October once (very low season), and it had a much more serene, quiet vibe at that time. But certainly during high season (summers and spring break), expect full occupancy and lots of children. We had a great time! ", " My wife and I had an excellent stay once again at this property. The staff (with a special shout out to Jez) was more than accommodating. Their is plenty to do and more importantly spots to hang out by yourself. The Laua was allot of fun and the snorkeling was was outstanding ( shout out to Ocean Sports). Lava Lava restaurant (5 minutes from hotel) is a must. The gym had plenty of equipment to get a great workout and the grounds were always maticulous. Great place for families with the Dolphin Experience and night glow mini golf. If you can't find something to do here you are not looking to do anything. Long flight from Boston so I will see you in 4 years or about the amount of time it takes me to forget about the flight. ", " We stayed at this property for four nights in June. The property is quite large and expansive as per other reviews you will walk very long distances between rooms and the front lobby. We stayed in the Makai tower, which is what I recommend because it is walking distance to the main lobby. If you stay in the ocean towers you have to take the tram or the boat or walk at least three quarters of a mile to get to the lobby the tram does not run frequently and sometimes you will have to wait up to 15 minutes for the tram. The property has a lagoon with a man-made small beach. There's no natural beach at this property, the closest beach is down the road 1 mile at the Marriott property. All beaches on the big island are considered public property with public access even if they are on private resorts. So feel free to use any beach you want.As for restaurants we ate at the Japanese restaurant the first night and it was good -moderately priced for resort restaurant. We also ate at the lounge where they serve Light fare. We used Hilton points for our stay so did not incur other expenses however you should know that there is a resort fee as well as ala cart fees for almost all services at the hotel. We did have a small refrigerator in our room. There's a small grocery store at the entrance to the resort and I recommend using that to purchase small items to eat as it will save you big dollars for breakfast.We rented our snorkel equipment at the next resort up called Mauna Lani at a place called snorkel Bob's. We paid nine dollars a day for excellent equipment compared to the $20 a day at the resort. I highly recommend renting equipment from snorkel bobs as you can return the equipment at the other store in downtown Kona. There are many lovely beaches on the side of the island where the snorkeling is excellent. Don't waste your time staying at the resort for activities where things are expensive. I recommend renting a car and exploring the island going to the other public beaches and seeing the lovely fish in the beautiful coral reefs. The artwork at the Hilton resort is lovely and makes the long walks more interesting. Parking is $28 per day valet. You can take your car in an out unlimited. I don't recommend self park because you only save five dollars per day and it's quite a walk down to that lot. You do need to plan in advance and call for your car as sometimes it can take 10 minutes to get your car if it's during a busy time, otherwise the valets are quite good and the car came up within 2 to 5 minutes. ", " My husband and I really enjoyed the hotel and our trip to the big island. The hotel is massive and you need to take boat or tram to get around ! It could take you 15-20 minutes to get from your hotel to parking lot. But if you are on vacation .. Who cares. Beautiful grounds with tons to do ! All restaurants in the hotel are pretty good. There are tons of pools, slides, hot tubs, bars, and places to eat. The only thing I didn't like was there were no umbrellas at the pool or much shade. They had cabanas to rent for 60 to 108 per day which is kind of pricey. ", " The best part of our trip was the rental of Lagoon/Ocean side Cabana #9 and our beautiful, gracious and incredibly hard working Cabana Attendant Jez! There is birthing more relaxing than listening to the soft flowing waves, watching the graceful Honu and relaxing in the breeze and shade of the cabana. Jez is a native Hawaiian with great knowledge of the ocean and its inhabitants, she was a wealth of information and was super diligent with keeping our glasses filled with ice water and our towels fresh. If you have the chance do yourself a favor and rent one of the \"Buddha Point\" cabanas and ask for Jez! It will make your vacation!!!! ", " We stayed at the Ocean tower and it seems all rooms have a view of the ocean except for a few on the first floor that might have a bush in the way. We were on the bottom floor and I have attached a picture of our view below. Before we got there we went to Waikoloa village market to stock up on snacks and sodas for the spouse. We went from the airport and it was only 12-15 minute drive past the turn off for the hotel to get to this grocery store (FYI also full liquor store). I didn't think it was a long walk from parking to lobby but I wouldn't want to do it with all of the luggage, but no big deal with just purse or back pack. I only took the \"train\" when I had all my luggage, otherwise I enjoyed walking and looking at the art or walking across the beautiful grounds. The Myna birds are loud but its better than listening to police sirens and trash trucks like you always here at city hotels. I enjoyed all of the pools, but I didn't go to the adult only pool, because it was so small and couldn't see much from there. The free morning breakfast/introduction was good to learn about things to do on the island and they can help schedule your tour. I didn't use the surface. At the end they talk about scheduling a time share, but I got up and left and didn't feel pressured. The room and bathroom were great, but frankly I didn't spend much time in the room except to sleep. I enjoyed the food I tried there and didn't feel it was way overpriced compared to other prices on the big island. I would stay again. ", " This is one of the most fun hotels we have ever stayed in. The grounds are beautiful, rooms are very nice, activities are plenty, there is water everywhere (pools, saltwater lagoon, waterfalls, and a man-made canal for hotel\u2019s own boat to take you around the resort) and top it off with several restaurants with a wide array of cuisines. We had a wonderful time watching the dolphins from our balcony while overlooking the lagoon, ocean, and mountains. The only problem is that there aren\u2019t any umbrellas around any of the pools which makes it really hard to stay cool in the hot Hawaii sun!! ", " Had a great time and will be returning! The property is very beautiful and I would recommend the buffet breakfast at the Hilton. There is so much to see and do there at the Hilton Waikoloa. The pool & hot tub will relax you for hours. ", " We booked the bed and breakfast package. Price was affordable, room was spacious, cozy, and very well kept. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a variety of choices. In my opinon it's \"The Best Breakfast Buffet\". Highly recommended!!! Swimming pool was huge. Waterslides, waterfalls, saltwater lagoon. Kids had a blast. ", " Spent 10 days. Wonderful. Went with family. My daughter in law got to touch, feed the dolphins, get ready to do a lot of walking. This property is absolutely beautiful. You could stay on site if you wanted to, but a short distance down from the property is the King and Queens shopping area. We have been there now 6 times and will continue to go back if the opportunity arises. A little piece of heaven. ", " Stayed their for 5 days. Very beautiful, very large hotel. Few different restaurants with large food varieties. Few different large pools. Overall hotel and grounds are well decorated and maintained. Tops class hotel in Hawaii. Bit expensive though but worth travelling. Rooms are large and modern. Very friendly service. ", " I have read a lot of reviews complaining the property is too large. First, it is really easy to get around this place. It is large, but if you don't want to walk you can take the tram or the boat. We walked a lot because frankly it was faster, it probably took us 10-15 min to walk from one end to the other. It can be confusing to get to your room because we had to go up to one floor via the stairs, then take the elevator up to our floor where our room was, but it wasn't a big deal.The amenities were great, we loved the dolphin quest and the lagoon. The beach was coral and rock and beautiful. We used the photo service, but didn't buy any - my tip would be don't schedule them at noon, the sun was too harsh. The pools are awesome!!!I would definitely stay here again. ", " Best hotel we stayed at in Hawaii! Fantastic service. Hotel dolphins and trainers. Sea turtles. Loved the cafe that looks over the Dolphins. Pools fantastic! Top Hilton. The room was immaculate and the bed was beyond comfortable. Go grab some beers from abc and sit on the balcony loving life ", " Stayed with my Mom for 9 days, our 4th trip there... Makai room facing the ocean. We swam with the Dolphins, layed around the pool, snorkeled, rode the $2.00 trolley back and forth to the Queen/ King markets for dining/shopping. Sorry we missed the Telescope tour this time but we didn't book early enough for this trip : ( Next time!! Can't wait to go back next year!! Mahalo : ) ", " extremely beautiful hotel on a huge property. Trains, boats, and pools with waterslides. huge main pool and natural lagoon is great for swimming, snorkeling, sup, and kayaking. great walking trails at the hotel . restaurants are expensive and parking is $25/night. ", " I was initially hesitant about staying at such a large resort, but as soon as I pulled up, I fell in love with the place. I think it is important to manage expectations. Yes the property is very large and it takes longer than you think to get from point A to point B. If you have a schedule, you need to give yourself more time than you think to get there. The food is expensive, but we found most restaurants on the Big Island to be pricey. Our family had two ocean front rooms in Ocean Towers for 7 nights and the views were amazing! I loved sitting on my balcony at sunset! Both rooms were spacious and clean. We found all the staff to be very friendly and hospitable. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Our kids are older teens and used the pools some but mostly we explored nearby beaches. The concierge, Mike was very helpful in directing us to several gorgeous beaches. When we did use the pool, while crowded we did manage to find chairs. One day we did stand up paddleboard in the sea lagoon (great for beginners) and snorkeled to view the sea turtles. We had breakfast included and then ate most meals off site as we explored the island. We loved the view of the dolphins at the lagoon grill as well as late night ice cream. While the trams and boats may be slow at times, occasionally it was faster to walk, we did find the boats to be relaxing and fun. The free DVD rentals were a plus. Just remember to return DVD to the same machine unlike redbox. The feral cats were not a problem unless you really dislike cats. These cats were all over the island, not just at Hilton. They are spayed and neutered and the staff treats them well. I saw some complaints about the loud birds and they were noisy but I actually liked it.Valet parking is only $5 more than self parking and totally worth it. We just called when we were leaving our room and the car was always ready for us.The only minor annoyance was the filming of \"Paradise Run\" a Nickelodeon show that is filmed at the resort. Areas of the resort were blocked off due to filming during our entire stay but it was also fun at times to watch how the show was created. If you want to see what the resort looks like just watch this show.This resort was so much fun with beautiful views everywhere you looked. We felt welcomed immediately. Really we have no complaints, only positives about this place. We would love to return again. It is a wonderful place for all ages. I loved the family friendly atmosphere. If our kids had been younger, I would have been content staying on the property most of the time. If you have mobility issues, you can still enjoy the property but may want to stay in a closer room to desired facilities.Thank you Hilton for a memorable family vacation! ", " This is the best hotel! We had a great time, enjoyed every bit of it. Def a large hotel and something for everyone. Lots of pools, lagoon to snorkel, My two boys, 12 & 10 wanted to stay longer. This is the ultimate hotel! We def will b coming back. ", " I stayed in Palace tower. Rooms were pretty good. No free water available in the rooms. There is a vending machine near 4th floor lift (behind the ice room) from where you can get the drinks.Views from the hotel are amazing during sunset.We can swim along with a big turtle in the lagoon & people are allowed to do other water activities like snorkelling in that lagoon.A nice Dolphin quest is there inside the hotel where people can swim along with the dolphins but at a premium price.Food wasn't that great. Restaurants were getting closed by 9:30pm - 10pm itself. For late night dinners, room service is the only option which is not that bad too. ", " I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in June 2015 during Kona half marathon week. This village exceeded my expectations! I had heard stories about the complex being too big, hard to get around, but it's really not too big. A typical Vegas casino-hotel is the same or larger.The grounds are a tropical garden and are maintained exceptionally well. The resort is on the ocean, with a rocky beach. This is gorgeous. You really can't swim there, but there are numerous pools and a lagoon for swimming. There are trains for people who can't walk or for children. Most healthy adults will not need them.The room I had was one of the updated ones...modern tropical vibe. Rooms are spacious. I had a lanai with chairs and a table, where I had coffee every day. The bathrooms are large and modern.The building I stayed in had a Hawaii coffee company on the ground floor, donut was easy to get a strong coffee or small breakfast every day. Other building amenities included a guest laundry.I went to the pool every day, got a chair facing the ocean. There were many families at this pool , but if a guests wants quiet , there is an adult pool available . I tried a lot of the restaurants. The \"Bug Breakfast\" buffet was extensive, and expensive. It's good if you love breakfast. There is a really nice seafood restaurant facing the ocean...my favorite. I used two different poolside cafes, the fast food one and one that is also a bar...nice for a quick snack. If one wants to get out of the resort, there are two open air shopping complexes with a variety of places to dine.Other interesting items about the resort are the inclusion of a dolphin experience and an extensive collection of ancient artifacts displayed in the lobby and main halls. I tried the luau one night, it was a fairly good buffet and show. I wanted to get service at the spa but did not have time. I did get items at the spa shop. There are other shops on premises which are well stocked and pleasant with helpful salespeople. And, there is a place where one can book excursions or adventures. I booked a snorkeling cruise and had a blast that day! If you go here for the half marathon or marathon, you will be pleased. The start is about a mile and a half away. There is a shuttle available for runners wanting to save energy on race morning. I shuttled to the start, then spent a half hour warming up. I could have walked! I ended up walking back from the finish.I found the staff at the HWV friendly and helpful. Many seemed genuinely interested in helping me having a good time. The resort is geared to all kinds of visitors. There were a lot of families , but also solo travelers and groups of friends. I wondered if I would miss the sand beach, but I did not. There is a sand beach at a \"beach club\" not far away. If wanted to go somewhere I did, but the resort has so many amenities/shops/services, one would not need to leave. One could check in and stay a week and have a great vacation! ", " What fabulous grounds and facilities. The amount and quality of the artwork along the covered walkway is hard to believe. Enjoy the scenery from the canal boats, the train or walking. It's all good. The main swimming pool, with waterfalls, slide and rotating water machine are fun for the kids especially. Dolphin Quest is great. Restaurants on site serve many tastes. We rate this hotel with 5 stars because it offers so much. Our room was less than stellar, more toward the 3 star level. Plans are to renovate the building apparently. ", " This hotel has the elegance, beauty and activities for everyone! When you think of a hotel, you think of the basic's, not here though.... They should have named this the Hilton Waikoloa Hotel and amusement Park. Lets start with 62 acre oceanfront resort, with 4 acre lagoons that has fish and turtles swimming around for your snorkeling enjoyment, paddle boats, restaurants, stores and a spa - plus much more that I can say. This hotel has amazing staff. ", " We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived. I recommend valet parking, very convenient. Quick service. We stayed at the Lagoon Makai Towers. Best location by far. Right by the pool, lagoon and Dolphins. The pool was amazing! The kids never wanted to leave. The food was pretty pricey, but we had a car, so we ate off property quite a bit. The rooms do have a little refrigerator, so we went to Walmart and bought some snacks and drinks for the room. The pizza at Dona and Toni's was excellent, we ate there a few times. They also have take-out. Overall this resort was fabulous, we have already planned to come back next year! ", " This is a difficult review to write. This was our first visit to Hilton Waikoloa Village and although it didn't fit our vacation lifestyle, it is nothing short of an excellent resort.This place is huge. The 1241 rooms are spread out over 62 acres. Transportation around the property is supplied by continually running trams and boats on a winding lagoon.Walking is an option, but I would recommend hiking shoes, a canteen and backpack with snacks! Only kidding, but yes, it is that big.The rooms are large with high ceilings and spacious baths and they are clean and comfortable. Everything you would expect from a first class resort. The activities are endless and planned so there is something for everyone. A concierge is always available by phone or text. Very convenient. Many of the attractions are perfect for families traveling with children. One example is the dolphin lagoon. Trainers conduct a great show and allow kids to pet and feed the dolphins. There are multiple pools on the property and none have an absence of water falls, water slides and play areas.A word to senior travelers like myself. Quiet is not an option. This is an active busy place. During busy times of the day, transportation can be slowed and you could wait 15 to 20 minutes for a tram or boat. Hilton does a very good job of maintenance, however with a property this big, you will find and occasional dent or ding.All in all this is a really great resort. If it sounds like it will fit your vacation lifestyle, try it, you'll like it. ", " This hotel is so great and so wonderfully maintained, you could almost smell new paint on the walls... Gorgeously manicured lawns, exotic native species of plants, birds singing everywhere, staff that go out of their way to greet you with Aloha and make sure you have everything you need... The dolphins were a little shy when we visited, but delightful to see, nonetheless... The best way to see it all is to walk (great trails all around the compound). They also have a monorail, but you get to see more wildlife if you stroll... like a pheasant just strutting around... Dining opportunities inside the compound are abundant, but very pricey. Great place. ", " Visited this place with family to cover full big island during one week of vacation. Need less to say, we were not disappointed. We saw 13 different weather during our full outer big island trip and stopping at most scenic and beautiful places along the way.Hotel is fantastic with river taxi of its own and could easily spend most time within the hotel if relaxing is all you care.We had a great family fun and memories. ", " We honeymooned here and always dreamed of bringing our kids! Both experiences were romantic and fun! Food was excellent and I just can't get over the beautiful ambiance of the resort over all. The staff is very friendly. Even down to the security guard and house keeping as they always were engaging and treated us as family too! Can;t wait to go again! ", " As Hilton Diamond members this was our first time staying here and what an experience! This place is huge! Over 68 acres of landscaped paradise. We stayed in a great room in the ocean tower, they upgraded us to an ocean view. Great sunsets from the balcony! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Included in the resort fee are free DVDs, in room WiFi, and other extra curricular activities. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island of Hawaii was one of the most pleasing experiences that my wife and I have had. Every staff member went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was nothing short of excellent. When my wife lost her sunglasses, a waiter at the restaurant where she last remembered having them checked with Security and with other vendors in the vicinity in an attempt to locate them. The Concierge at Ocean Tower provided prompt and complete information whenever we needed it. The grounds and the setting of this resort are breathtaking! It's truly Paradise! ", " We stayed in the Ocean Tower of Hilton Waikola Village and it was so wonderful. The highlight was the Waikoloa Sunset Dining at the Kamuela Provision Company (KPC). Amazing fish Monchong. It was such a beautiful site, sunsetting, and lantens in background with sun setting. Loved this place. We snarkeled at the hotel site and saw sea turtles, angel fish, etc. The hotel was so nice and the service was great. We woke to loud birds outside our room every morning! Like a rain forest flock of birds outside our tower. ", " We had a nice ocean view triple room where we can see the dolphins nursery pond too. The Hotel landscape is so huge which you will take quite some time to explore. There are both tram and boat services starting from the Lobby to the other end of the Hotel which you must try both. There is also an open air restaurant by the ocean front. A free shuttle bus is available to the 2 malls and back to the Hotel. Sent from my iPad ", " Taking peaceful boat between the immense layout of this resort takes me make to my childhood at Disneyland. The wooden boats slip you past lagoons, flower gardens, and 5 star restaurants. The high light was swimming with green sea turtles in the lagoon. Excellent staff. Diamond members are treated very well! If you like to leave the resort to explore the local area/food, this resort make it a little hard for that due to the size of the property and proximity to adjacent town. The only issue I saw was if you have the first flight out of Hilo, there isn't an easy way to drag all your bags across the entire length of the property to our car, because the boat service (or any other live human) is not available.Hilton Surfer ", " We stayed here during SpringBreak this year. As others have noted, this is a huge property and that in itself is part of its beauty as well as explains its potential negatives. The drive from the airport was about 30 min and because our flight was a few hours late, we were driving in the dark. Be aware the roads are very dark!! Not much lighting which is good in general I would say, in preserving the area, however it makes for a more challenging drive. However all went well. Parking: unfortunately you are forced to pay for parking-and I agree this is unacceptable for a paying guest. However, be aware that handicapped valet parking is complimentary! We stayed in the Ocean Tower, and this is at the far end of the property. The tram and the boat system help with transportation around the resort but if you chose to walk, it was a beautiful walk. Walking on the path along the ocean was absolutely postcard/picture perfect. The lagoon and all of the garden areas were just beautiful. The sea turtles in the lagoon were my favorite sight to see! We ate several times at Dona &Tony's solely because it was the cheaper of the options but still overpriced. The food was good but small portions and overall, overpriced. We did not go to the Teppanaki restaurant nor the pricey-ier one up on the cliff-we just couldn't justify paying that much. We loved eating at the poolside restaurant-lots of variety: salads and breaded chicken, ice cream, shaved ice etc but it was only open until 3pm. Pool was beautiful but a little chilly-gotta keep moving! We rented a paddle boat and that was fun as we got up close to some turtles swimming! There are good opportunities to snorkel in the lagoon as it connects right up to the ocean-although it is very rocky (and chilly!) and signs warn you of danger. Because the lagoon feeds the hotel \"river\" I often saw beautiful tropical fish. I really loved this place. Service was very good and you could easily stay on the property for a few days and be entertained or find relaxation. Only bad experience was the high-pressure skincare Crystal boutique-we lost 30 min of our vacation that we will never get back-we never should have stopped to listen!! Anyway, as an FYI the only restaurant that we noticed outside of the resort was a Macaroni Grill which as in a Mall area; there were some other eateries but I didn't notice any obvious restaurants and so we ended up eating in the resort for our meals. You can reserve a hospitality room for a fee ($75..? I am forgetting now) but this will allow you to use a hotel room after check out, to shower and freshen up. Seems pricey ( shouldn't that just be complimentary...?)All in all, I think I would come back here! ", " Once again, we returned to the Hilton Waikoloa for our family vacation. We decided to upgrade with an email promotion after receiving confirmation for our initial reservation. The promotion was for a $117 upgrade above our original $169 RES.....up to a One Bedroom Ocean Tower Suite for $286/N. Upon arrival and checking in, we wondered what the suite looked like and if we could get any personal opinion. We don't normally spend an extra $117 per night, we usually look for the best price period. We were very lucky to come across Nicholas at the front desk. Despite the beginning of a busy Memorial Day weekend, he took the time to get an iPad and explained all the differences between a regular room and the suite with pictures and personal opinion. After an awesome virtual explanation with pictures & property/dining recommendations, Nicholas checked us into Suite #6098. We honestly think his first impression and ALOHA in putting US FIRST when checking in was second to none. His help and knowledgeable and courteous hospitality totally made us feel welcome and happy to be back to the Hilton Waikoloa. Then we got to the room....and we are blown away. The Suite is HUGE and we are so happy. We have already made up our minds that this will be our room next year for sure!!! Mahalo to Nicholas and all the hardworking Hilton Waikoloa team members for always providing our family with an enjoyable family stay. ", " Hotel service is excellent like other reviewers mentioned. Few tips, self park can feel far at times. Make sure you are bringing things back with you that you may need the following morning. The tram takes about 15 min to get from Ocean Tower (where we stayed) to the larger resort pool/area, so plan accordingly. All resort food is $$$, I ate every meal at queens marketplace, specifically island market place. This will safe you money but not necessarily time. An example of good customer service, I left my water kanteen on the tram and called security who delivered it to my room, its a nice feeling to know you don't have to be skeptical of your belongings. Sigh.. I want to go back already. ", " What is there not to like about a trip to Hawaii?This Hilton resort is truly amazing. The landscaping is very impressive. Travel to your room by boat, train or on foot. Swim with the dolphins. Kayak in the lagoon with turtles. The swimming pool is large, complete with rope bridge, waterfall and water slide, suitable for both adults and children. We have stayed in regular rooms and luxury suites. All were excellent. There are many restaurants at the resort, both casual and more formal and several restaurants in the Queens' MarketPlace and Kings' Shops about a mile or so away. The primary breakfast area is quite large and the food is good with wait-service. There are many works of art throughout the hallways. The feeling is very much one of being in the open air without the stuffy hallways of most hotels.The staff was very helpful. Be prepared to pay for parking either self-park or valet.Do not expect natural sandy beaches in this resort. This coast is not the most picturesque like the northeast side of the island, but the luxury of the resort makes up for this. The most convenient airport for this resort is Kona. The Hilo airport is a long way away. The drive from the Kona airport to the resort looks like a moonscape, accentuating the luxury of the resort, appearing as an oasis in comparison. Head northeast to see the beautiful coastline, waterfalls etc, south to head towards the volcanic activity of this island or east to climb to the island summit.We look forward to a return visit to this very impressive resort.Prepare to have a great vacation! ", " Stayed in the Village with my family during vacation. Enjoyed it very much as its' a very quite place, while stunning view in front of hotel rooms. Hotel is like a museum with oriental antiques & decoration in the corridor. Market is a bit far from the resort, while still within walking distance. ", " I received excellent service from Edward at the front desk....EXCELLENT. Every question was answered and every need was met. He is wonderful!!!!!! Edward is so friendly and nice and helpful. I'm so so thankful you found and hired this gem. ", " The resort is great! Our plans are to make this resort our annual family vacation. From the moment our family arrived we were greeted with a warm Hawaiian welcome. The staff there are so helpful and accommodating. ", " This is a great place for families and/or couples. Lots of things to do and peaceful. The staff is very helpful and accommodating too. If you're looking to unwind and just relax, this is your place. Highly recommend. ", " Waikoloa Hilton hotel is the most amazing establishment in the Hawaiian Islands. The many Chinese artefacts that surrounds the hotel must in themselves cost millions. You can spend hours admiring the beauty of these relics. Quite a unique experience also being escorted to your room by water boats or train. The Ocean view rooms are the best. The gardens are beautifully kept as is the grounds. The dozens of pools that hug the complex completes the beauty of this grande hotel. ", " It has all you could want. Canal boats to get you to your room and around the complex, lots of Buddahs and lost of pools, very good food and good golf. It is picture perfect, but you might feel you were in Disneys Polynesian village in FL. ", " As you'll read from other reviews of this hotel, it is beautiful! We enjoyed long walks all over the resort every night with a stop at the ice cream parlor for fun Hawaiian ice creams! But here's what defines the hotel for me. Our room was on the lower level of Oceans Tower. We had a beautiful view and a lovely room. But it was humid; more than just island humid, it was swamp-like. I had maintenance come check our a/c. It checked out, but wasn't taking out the humidity. I asked if there was any way I could get a dehumidifier. The maintenance man didn't know, but said he would check. A few minutes later another employee brought us a dehumidifier! It think they must have taken it out of the break room or something; it wasn't a beauty (lol), but it did work! They even offered to come dump the water when it got full. I told them I thought we could handle that, but we appreciated his offer. That is the kind of service that impresses me. We ate many breakfasts at the buffet at the resort. It was excellent with many great options including made-to-order omelettes! The only other place we ate at the resort was the Cantina. It was nothing to write home about, but it was edible. Be sure you have a rental car while you're here. This Hilton is an easy drive to Kona or Waimea where you will find many good restaurants. Otherwise, you can take care of all of your tour and activity planning needs right at the hotel. Enjoy! ", " This resort was clean, large and beautiful. The rooms were very nice and immaculate. I saw reviews that the resort was too large and not convenient but I totally disagree. Yes it is large but everything is within walking distance on trails with beautiful view OR you can take the tram or a boat each having several stops. No inconvenience at all. We stayed on what I would say is the quieter side but it had many conveniences like a coffee/snack bar, a Mexican restaurant and a concierge desk. Would definitely go back to this resort. My husband didn't want to leave. Splurged and took an oceanfront room - MAGNIFICENT!! ", " I love it that you do not have to leave property. Shopping and restaurants had amazing options. Imari was incredible. There is a restaurant for breakfasts for buffet or menu. Room service fast and hot when it arrives. Some people think it too large a property and have to walk too far but come on... There is a tram (view their web site) or gondola that goes from one end to the other if you don't wish to exercise. While walking the outdoor corridors offer many styles of elegant art work. Another area has 7 foot statue replicas of the zodiac. Many surprises tucked away in nooks. Pool options galore from adults only to saltwater. Don't forget the swim with the dolphin option. If you wish to take a day trip to Hilo or Volcano it is a shorter drive than from Kona. ", " This resort has the most beautiful grounds and amenities, including transportation to your room by tram or boat. Service was awesome. Numerous restaurant choices, bars, beach area and alternate pools throughout the resort. Just walking the grounds is an experience. We attended a luau at the hotel and was one of the best in the area. ", " Definitely would recommend this property. Be patient and search a few times ( on their website, because they definitely change promotions) . One of the best promotions is the free buffet breakfast with the room ($32.95 per person otherwise) . You can also bring kids and order just a bagel or cereal for them while you eat away. Palace tower has a great view of the lagoon and ocean, higher up the better, we stayed at the Ocean tower with an oceanfront room. Waking to the Ocean view every morning was amazing. It is fun to take the boat or tram to the Ocean tower, they do run regularly but they do run on Hawaiian time. Staff was exceptionally friendly and there are a ton a people there to book expeditions or tours. If you plan on doing a lot of tours, take the Grand Vacation Seminar ( 90 minutes) but then you get a Holo Holo card which gives you tons of discounts. We saved over $220 on an 8 line zip tour alone. Excellent time in Paradise. I also have to address some of the previous comments. The bug comment from a previous viewer - every island in the tropics has bugs (maybe you should go back to middle school and study geography and science before traveling again). The comment about not being able to find your room - it is a hotel where the first number is your floor and all the rooms are numbered sequentially. Don't be afraid to ask questions and maybe also go back and take middle school math. There are various ways to enjoy the water here as well. There is a lagoon fed from the ocean, which is great for snorkeling. There is an adult only pool. There is a pool mainly for kids. Lastly, there is a very large pool which has a sandy no step entry at one end for small kids and a deeper section with a larger water slide for bigger kids and adults. Tough to get lounge chairs at the lagoon.Dolphin quest at the resort is pricey but amazing and you can watch for free.Be prepared for the resort fees and state taxes, it will add about $80-100 to your room bill per day. Also, rumor floating around the resort is that the Ocean Tower is going to be converted to a time share. Possible reason for one of the restaurants in the Ocean Tower permanently closed down. Restaurants for lunch and dinner are good at the resort , but limited.Last note, there are a few cats on the property by the buildings to control small pests, they are scared of humans and run away, but they were also nice to watch lazing in the sun.Free wifi in the room, had to log in daily. We did not use the free movie rentals or free playstation games offered in the available kiosks. Rooms had nice large TV's, daily coffee to make, and a fridge. ", " We love to vacation here, we love the ground's the breath taking view's and the best part is the pool with the water fall, huge slide, swim up bar, and hidden hot tub in the grotto. We have been going here since 1990, and return every chance we get ! If you have children this is a great place, they love to ride the monorail or the boat's throughout the hotel. ", " Ernette at the Hilton Honors front desk provided exceptional service this morning. She went up and above to meet our departure needs - service with a smile and a can-do attitude. Also the valet and housekeeping services at the Waikola Village Hilton was terrific. TC ", " Absolutely beautiful. Great pools, beautiful sunsets, wonderful, clean rooms. Restaurants are a little pricey, but it's Hawaii. Has to be one of the nicest places we have stayed. Great for Honeymooners. ", " This is a great place for Seniors and family, they even had a kid club. That is right no beach but they beach entry swimming area. If you do not want to eat lunch and supper at the hotel, take the shuttle to Queens Market, and go to the Island Gourmet Market, prices not too bad.I upgraded to the Lagoon Tower with Mikia, the bennifits are HUGE, if you sign up for the curtal class without the Miaki upgrade they are $15 but with the Miakia they are free. There are other discounts with the upgrade. ", " This was our first trip to the big island and I didn't think it would match the beauty of the other islands but I was wrong. The Hilton Wiakolo was beautiful. The grounds act as an Asian Art gallery and every Vista was designed to please the eye and evoke a sense of well being and it succeeded in doing just that. The hotel is huge so prepare to do some walking especially if the tram or boat system is running slowly . Prices of food are expensive but that's of any upscale chain. We took advantage of a couples message in a cabana overlooking the ocean , best spa experience ever!!! We will definitively be back. Great rooms ,friendly staff , beautiful settling can't be beat well worth the money. ", " Amazing property! Positives: 1)Beautiful. 2)Spotlessly clean, and I mean everywhere. Rooms, pools, grounds, chapel, tram, boats...everything. 3)View, do not miss the sunset from Budha Point (see picture below) 4)Very friendly, fast staff. 5)protected Lagoon, that we saw many fish and sea turtles in. 6)Amazing omelet maker at the breakfast-almost like being in a Japanese steak house. 7)Seaside Chapel service on Sundays-non denominational, included a hula as worship.Negatives: 1)The birds can be loud for about 30 minutes right at daybreak (we actually enjoyed it, but it did wake us up everyday). 2)EXPENSIVE! Rooms not too bad but a $50 resort fee and $25 a day to park. Topped off with very expensive food, buffet breakfast $35 per person, but surprisingly worth it. 3)Not enough seating for the chapel. Get there early as we had people litteraly sitting in the windows, and standing outside.Advice: 1)Bring fish food/bread to fead the Koi. Not sure if we were allowed, but it was a relaxing blast. 2)Take advantage of the free shuttle to the beach(not well publicized) that you get from the valets 3)Take advantage of the shuttle to the shops (or walk) if you do not have a car. Much cheaper meals. ", " The lush landscape, beautiful architecture and superior customer service of Hilton Waikoloa Village (Maria Elena and Kalehua at the front desk) assured our return and truly embodied the aloha spirt!! We could not find one deficient element of this resort. As a Hilton Diamond, I have stayed at hundreds of these hotels, in Hawaii and on the mainland, and this is one of the best I have experienced. Thank you for making our vacation that much more special. ", " Great accommodations and variety of restaurants. Good local beaches and excursions. Particularly liked the night swim with the Manta Rays and highly recommend. Heli ride over the lava fields from Hilo was great as well ", " If you want a stay where you don't want to, or have to leave, this is the place. Excellent staff, rooms, and total experience! So quiet you didn't know anyone else was around you. The pools, lagoon, and activities on site far surpass all expectations. ", " I am about halfway through my stay but can really say this is a spectacular property in a beautiful location. Within reach of everything you would want to do on Hawaii and with staff that facilitates everything for you. Hope to be coming back at least once a year. ", " My wife and I spent 8 days & Nights in April. One of the best vacations we've ever had. We booked this trip a year ago. Since then I had seen a lot of negative reviews and I was getting a little concerned. Our experience was fantastic. We stayed in a Makai room with an ocean view. A few days before our arrival I received an e-mail offering me early check-in for $25. Since our flight arrived at 10 am I took the offer. The day before arrival I got an e-mail that allowed me to check-in early. Next I got a confirmation e-mail which told me to check-in at the Hilton honors desk when I arrived. When we arrived we left our bags and car with the valet. Check-in took about 2 minutes and then we were escorted to our room. Our bags arrived 5 minutes later. The room was very nice and the view was incredible. We were on the 4th floor and looked out over the lagoon and the ocean beyond that. We could also see the dolphins and a pen with 2 sharks. From our balcony we could see fish swimming in the lagoon and on several occasions turtles. We could also watch the dolphins. We spent a lot of time just relaxing on the balcony enjoying the views. TIP: Bring binoculars. The resort grounds are beautiful and large. I spent hours walking and exploring. Two trams ran each day usually every 10-15 minutes. In the afternoon and evening two boats run about every 20-30 minutes. Each tram stop has a screen that tells how long until the next tram. Also channel 4 on your room TV shows the tram and boat schedule, so before you head out you can check to see how long you'll have to wait. If you are in a hurry or have luggage or strollers, take the tram. The boat is more for leisurely sight seeing. Twice we rode the boat round trip just to see the sights. One night one of the boats broke so only one was running and the wait was longer. The boat canals are full of fish. In the morning the water is clear and you can see them. When the boats start running at 2 pm they stir up a lot of silt and water is not nearly as clear. We rented a car but ended up enjoying the resort so much we only left it 3 times during our stay. There is a shopping mall and market nearby. Some reviews say you can walk to it. It's almost a mile away so it was too long of walk for us. There is a shuttle bus that runs from the resort to the mall. The cost is $2 each way. Next time I think we'll skip the car rental (and parking charge) and just use the shuttle.  There are 3 beautiful pools. The big is open until 10 pm which we thought was great. Usually when we stay in Hawaii the pools close at 6, which I find very annoying. Unfortunately the water was too cold for us to enjoy the pool. We snorkeled in the lagoon twice. The visibility was not good, which surprised me. It looked so clear from our room but once you got in the water it wasn't. Still we were able to see a lot of fish and the lagoon is safe and easy to get into. All the staff were very friendly and attentive. We didn't see any of the rudeness or slow response others have complained about. Prior to arriving I had requested foam pillows and extra towels. They weren't there when we arrived so I called housekeeping. They apologized and the items were in our room when we returned from dinner. One night my wife broke a bottle. Glass and Mai Tai mix were all over the floor. I called housekeeping and they were there in less than 5 minutes to clean up. Everything in Hawaii is expensive and so is the resort. Be prepared. There is a resort fee. When I booked the trip the fee was $25 a day. We were charged $30 a day. Apparently the fee has gone up. On top of that there are still extra charges for some resort activities. $5 to play pool, $10 for mini-golf.  Despite a couple of minor irritations that could and should be eliminated overall this is one of the best resorts we have ever stayed at. My experience was 5 stars. ", " The inclusive package we obtained made this a great value and experience for us. Staff was very friendly, room was clean and bed was comfortable. We stayed in the Makkai Tower which was convenient to the pools, food, lobby - view was both mountains and ocean. Big Island Breakfast was great - we ate there every morning. Hilton reps emailed during the stay and took care of the one problem (late checkout due to flights). Sand bottom pool was good for our toddler. Dolphins were entertaining to watch having lunchs at the Grill. Location was good for snorkeling at a black sand beach and seeing a coffee farm. Very relaxing stay even with the toddler. ", " Stayed for 8 days - loved every one of them! Swimming and snorkeling in the lagoon is outstanding and just a quick walk from rooms. Multiple restaurants on site make it easy to choose from where to go for breakfast, lunch and dinner! ", " We loved this place. So many things to do right on the resort. The room was ok, nothing special but the view was amazing. We were able to watch the sunset from our patio every night! Some places more expensive than others. We really liked the pizza place. You can take a tram or a boat to your part of the hotel which is cool. Staff is very friendly and helpful! ", " I really enjoyed this trip, it was a solo opportunity for me to find peace and center myself after a rough few months. The staff were really friendly, great amenities (I gave my life to the spa) Great activities and staff are always willing to help you locate something fun to do. The luau was nice but I didn't enjoy the food but great entertainment! A little pricey but they gave away $10 coupons to use at pretty much anywhere. Nice Lagoon and close to the beach. I would definitely recommend this place for familes or couples.I wasn't crazy about the tram, it needed to run more frequently but over it was a good stay. ", " Our family loves to stay here. We get to visit the resort more time than most people since we live on island. Our 6 year old loves the different pools and the and natural lagoon. Our favorite restaurant is Lagoon Grill. Some of the best food on property. ", " Special area for check-in for Makai was a surprise bonus. Great view of the lagoon and ocean from Makai tower. Makai experience was great. Loved the extra amenities and the convenience. Water taxi was fun. Food by the lagoon was delicious and service was excellent. We stayed three nights. We would have wanted more time. ", " I travel and stay at many Hiltons (of which I love)...but this particular Hilton was extra special for my family vacation. We had beautiful/ adjoining rooms. The staff was extreemly outgoing and kind. The grounds were perfect and beautiful. Thank you so much! ", " Love to be so well taken care of. Besides the beauty of the site, the staff and grounds were designed to accommodate every persons desire. You want a spa? world class, hiking? around the bay for you. Nice pool? take your pick. Beach? of course! Will definitely be back! ", " My daughter and her husband stayed here 5 years ago and had a fabulous time, but said 7 days was not enough. I stayed there for 15 days and it could not have been better. I booked the inclusive trip through Costco Travel, air, car, and automatic upgrades at the hotel. Can't say enough about the place......beautiful and relaxing, and also having enough time to explore most of the island. ", " You can never go wrong staying at any of the Hilton Brand Hotels. I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa and it was first class. From the moment of check in, to the simple welcome text message offering assistance, the tram or boat ride to your room, quick elevators, the spacious and modern room, nice views, soft beds and pillows, friendly staff, great weather, large and fun swimming pool they have a brand that is tops and above all. I forgot something in the room and inquired via text message from the airport and they responded. My item was turned in and I should be receiving it by Tuesday or Wednesday this week.We are already planning our trip back later this year. See you there! ", " The resort is simply beautiful. The staff is the best in the industry, they make you feel like a member of their Ohana. Rooms are outstanding, request ocean view. Fantastic sunsets and sunrises. Valet & room service quick & friendly. The Dolphins are a must see. ", " Loved service provided. Nice front desk people, pool side staffs, guides in boat. Gorgeous landscape and pools. Perfect for family vacation. We all loved night view of the resort from the boat. Only downside is food quality for the price. But overall I recommend this place! ", " Great place to bring a family. Lots to do and see. We loved the dolphins and and the kids beach was perfect for our granddaughter. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. Service was terrific. The valet service was fast and convenient. ", " My expectations were very high and were more than met. This, absolutely, is the place to visit Hawaii Island for the first time (I've stayed here at least five). Do NOT go there for bargain prices, but know that the level of service and the fab ulous amenities require a fair price to maintain. I have found no better levels of \"magic\" anywhere else in the U.S. ", " We purchased the upgraded Makai room package which puts you in the Makai tower and access to the large pool. The rooms were basic (nice double vanity bathroom) but the views of the ocean and dolphin lagoon were fabulous. Watching the dolphins from the balcony was a fun activity in itself. We also really enjoyed the snorkeling in the natural salt water lagoon which was full of tropical fish and sea turtles. Staff was friendly and for a large property hotel very responsive. There are quite a few options for dinner on property and the food was good but expect to pay resort prices. Recommend buying some basic food items at the local grocery store to stock the fridge. I would definitely recommend this property for a family vacation. ", " We believe the check-in sets the tone for the stay. We are not very tech savvy so when we were given options online to check-in we were unsure of what to do. When we did the actual check in at the Hilton Honors front desk it was a breath of fresh air. Our reservation was processed with Ernette. We feel Ernette was knowledgeable, considerate and filled with aloha. She took her time to explain the \"tech\", online process and upcoming upgrades to the system. She informed us of the app and how it works. She explained other features to look for and made sure we were satisfied. We feel that she did everything in her position to make sure we were informed, happy and ready for our weekend. Mahalo Hilton Waikoloa for having Great Team Members. -PT\"Customers may forget what you said but they'll never forget how you made them feel. \"Unknown ", " This is a very large hotel but has options of how to get around with a tram and boat. The property is well maintained and our room had a wonderful sea view. My only concern was having captive dolphins on the property that people could interact and swim with. I am not a fan of this sort of activity as I believe they are still a wild animal. The pool area they swam in during the day was not very big and there were quite a few dolphins. The Room was comfortable and spacious. My only gripe is with the coffee machine that is in the room. If you are a tea drinker, the only way you could get hot water is through this machine, that makes your tea taste like coffee. Could I request a kettle as this would serve both the tea and coffee drinkers ", " Stayed there for the Lavaman triathlon. I have never been to such an amazing, magical resort. The main lobby smells amazing. That was the first thing I noticed. There is a train and a gondola to take you from one end of the resort to the other. It is a sprawling resort, and I walked a lot every day. Walking, there are two ways to get from one end to the other - there is a path that goes outside along the ocean. And an open hallway with artefacts, statues, etc., of so many interesting things - it is like a walk-through museum. The pool on the south side is winding and huge, with three hot tubs, one with a water fall, and there is a lava rock cavern over the one end of the pool and one of the hot tubs is in the cavern. There are openings in the rocks so you can see the stars at night... Great stargazing if you walk down past the resort to the beach. The Italian restaurant on the resort has the most amazing calamari and great pizza. There are dolphins and flamingos on the property, and sea turtles in the lagoon. Its absolutely beautiful. Staff including Mike and Nelson were great at recommending food and activities off resort. Renting a car and seeing the island is a must! The room, I only really slept in ... It was very nice, very clean, balcony. Wifi was free in common areas. Huge fountain/statue in lobby of palace tower, where my room was. ", " This was such a wonderful place to stay at in the HGVC resorts. We had wonderful views of the ocean. Everyone was wonderful to us except a maintenance man regarding the dryer that you could run for 2 hours and it would still not dry your clothes. He said there was nothing wrong with the dryer, but I've never had to dry a small load of clothes for that long without them getting dried. We would stay there again, but would hope they would do something about the dryers in the rooms. ", " I enjoyed this hotel, really a village. Sprawling yet intimate. You really need a good few days on the hotel grounds to fully enjoy. We did just me and the wife this time, but next time we'll take the kids! ", " Great experience. They treat Honors members great. Special thanks to Ernette for her help and great service. Got to check out the pools and all the great services. Wonderful place on the island! Close to great stuff (Spencer, Kona, Hapuna, Shopping). ", " We had a wonderful time. The resort was very nice and accommodating. Wonderful lagoon for snorkeling and water play. Be prepared to spend $$ extra for amenities. There is wonderful paths along the oceanfront but no beaches. The boat transportation with in the resort was very nice. ", " My husband and I spent our honeymoon on the Big Island at the Hilton Waikoloa - 8 days and 8 nights - so we had plenty of time to explore and experience the resort. Here are some highlights, tips, and info that could be helpful to you if you are considering it!- The resort has several options for where to stay, but we stayed in a King Oceanside room at the Makai at Lagoon Tower - if it is in your budget ($~380/night), I highly recommend! Our room was on the 5th floor, ocean front, with views of the water, pool, and dolphin quest. The room itself was very clean and looked updated. Bed was comfy and our bathroom had double sinks with a separate room for toilet and shower. Great lanai with chairs and a small table to enjoy morning coffee and breakfast outside. Staying at the Makai also gives you your own concierge desk, which can get you priority reservations at some of the fancier restaurants if you make them before 4 pm that day for later in the evening. You also receive 2 free bottles of water daily and free DVD movie rentals that you can play in the in-room PS3. When you check in, they give you a bracelet that identifies you as a Makai guest, which also means free and unlimited towels for the pool. The Makai is also much more centrally located than the Ocean or Palace Towers. It's a quick walk to the biggest pool, luau site, resort convenience store (which sells water, drinks, snacks, toiletries, beer, etc.) and a coffee stand downstairs that serves hot and cold beverages and breakfast items. Depending on which restaurant you wish to try, it's closer to KPC and a medium walk to the others, but the weather is usually so pleasant we enjoyed the strolls. If it's in your budget as a couple vacationing or as a family with children, I highly recommend for its proximity and amenities.- As others have mentioned, the grounds are large - however, you get oriented as to where things are within the first day or so. We did not find the walking to be a problem - if you have young children and are staying somewhere else than Makai, I could see where it would be a challenge, but otherwise it iis manageable. We took a canal boat ride just for the experience and never took the tram. Both seemed to run regularly, but there is a small wait that you can plan for if you watch the signs or your TV as to when they are arriving and plan around that. Other than the one boat ride, we walked everywhere and enjoyed being able to stop and watch the dolphins, admire the views, and enjoy the surroundings.- We spent most of our time at the larger pool, Kona. We never had an issue finding a lounge chair and tried to locate near the pool bar (Makai also has a separate reserved seating area just for Makai guests). There is a nearby restaurant marketplace called Orchid where you can get drinks, ice cream, pizza, sandwiches, hot dogs, etc., if you want lunch not in a restaurant (think almost cafeteria style - grab, go, pay at register). The pool water was clean, and there are a couple of adjacent hot tubs. The pool is open until 10 if you want a night swim.- Other than the pool being open until 10, there is not much nightlife except for in the Malolo Lounge, which serves drinks, upscale bar food, and usually has live music or karaoke. We stopped in once but really, we were up every day by 8 and had such a full day relaxing and exploring that we were in bed by 11. We're both in our mid-30s and had no problem with this - we didn't want to be hungover or too tired to enjoy the sites or waste any of the next day! The ice cream place near Lagoon Grille is open until 8 if you want to take the kids (or yourselves) for a sweet treat outside the restaurants later in the evening (their brownie sundae is amazing).- Food is pricey for the most part, but then again you're at a resort and you're on Hawaii. Our favorite meals were at KPC (try the monchong!!) where we did pay $25 extra per person one night to have front row, outdoor seating near the water's edge for the sunset - totally worth it! The other night we ate there we also sat outside, but further in - still great views. We also enjoyed Imari, where you can go for sushi or tempanyaki/hibachi. Lagoon Grille closes at 5, but is a great casual seat-yourself outdoor bar and grill near Dolphin Quest. Good burgers and fries kind of place. We were not impressed with the Cantina (not bad but nothing special) or Dona & Toni's (we had pasta entrees vs. pizza, which may have been a better choice, so our mistake). Big Island breakfast buffet is expensive, but has a large selection - we tried this one morning. For breakfast the rest of the time, we either visited the coffee stands for coffee and bagels, ordered room service (once - a little pricier but very good), or visited the nearby Queens Shops where there is a grocery store to pick up coffee cake/muffins the day before (the hotel has a shuttle that runs from the resort to the Queens Shops and the more high-end Kings Shops; it is $2/person but it is also walkable).- The resort does not have a beachy area. Most of the coastline is rocky. However, you can walk or drive to the Marriott on the same street where there is access to the beach at A Bay. If you have a car, Hapuna Beach (ranked one of the best in the US) is a short drive away and has restrooms, changing rooms, and a snack bar if you want to make the day of it. We honestly had no problem with lack of beach at the resort and were content to either lay at the pool (one end of the Kona pool does have a sandy bottom and small sandy beach for kids), lounge in a hammock, visit the nearby beaches, or hang at the ocean-fed lagoon, which has a narrow sandy beach along one side of it. The lagoon has lounge chairs, but be sure to snag one earlier in the day as most parents camp out here to watch their kids play, snorkel, and paddle board so they can fill up fast. Otherwise, you can toss your towels and flip flops on the grass nearby. The lagoon is home to fish, crabs, and sea turtles. My husband took a paddle board out and later we took a kayak out together. Not to blow Makai's horn again, but we received a 20% discount on these rentals by being Makai guests. The lagoon also has servers walking around taking orders for drinks or lunch if you prefer to eat there vs at the restaurant. You can charge things to your room, which we found handy if we didnt want to take cash or a credit card down (not that we ever felt unsafe).- The luau at the resort was a great experience. The show is a little campy and touristy, but entertaining. The food was also great - a wide variety for everyone. We upgraded our seating to Al'i and all our drinks were included. With this upgrade, we also had a table upfront near the stage. There were a few local artists selling jewelry and art if you want a souvenir not straight from the gift shop but that is unique and locally made.- We also had the opportunity to enjoy the spa. As it was our honeymoon, we had booked a couples massage in one of the seaside cabanas - very relaxing! With a spa appointment, you are granted access to the other spa amenities for the day, such as their hot tub and steam room. The locker room was clean and all the staff were friendly.- We rented a car one day, which you can do at the rental car place on site. 24 hours advance notice is recommended. We picked it up and turned it back in at valet - very convenient! There is also a UPS store on site, which we used to ship back souvenirs vs trying to cram them into our luggage. - We paid separately for our spa experience, but all our room charges, resort fees, and dinner charges came in at the end under $5000. Keep in mind, we were there for 8 days/8 nights so half of that was for our room/resort fees. The rest was our bar tab (maybe had 3-4 drinks between us a day) and meals (at least 2, usually lunch/dinner a day). Expensive? Yes. But the bill came in under what we had expected so we were happy. We didn't feel like we had denied ourselves anything, and this was our honeymoon afterall. There are ways to cut costs (visiting the local store for supplies is one - there is a fridge in the Makai rooms and a microwave if you request it) but we were happy for the value and quality we received.- We did see many families there, but I can see where the size might be overwhelming for most kids under 8. That being said, having so much on one property is very convenient! We only rented a car one day and the rest of the time stayed on campus, where we had everything we needed and were never bored. Many dining options and activities, and the grounds are beautiful, clean, and well kept. If you prefer to stay at a resort that is all encompassing, this is for you. On our day off campus, we visited the restaurant at the nearby Fairmont Orchid and walked through the hotel, as well as walked through the nearby Marriott to get to A Bay access - both looked nice, but the Hilton is definitely the one-stop shop for dining and amusement if that's what you are looking for, and we were glad we had chosen it after seeing the other 2 as it more fit our needs and what we wanted.- I hope this info was helpful to you! We had read previous reviews about the property and were a little nervous upon arriving about the amount of walking and lack of beach, but these proved to be non-issues for us and at times wondered why others had made a big deal about them! Everyone we met, staff and other visitors, were pleasant, happy, polite, and helpful. Many local staff members were willing to share some inside info and tips on their favorite places (try Lava Lava Beach Club for a beach side lunch at A Bay!) that we wouldn't have known about otherwise. This Hilton was a great choice for our honeymoon and all the other visitors we saw looked to be enjoying it with their spouses and children. As a couple, we would recommend it to all our families and friends visiting the Big Island! ", " Check in and check out was quick and easy, and the service at this hotel is excellent. Once you check in, the place is amazing. You can go to your room on either a boat or a tram. On the boat you can see fish along the way, but the view is amazing from both. You can also walk to your room through some very amazing and unique paintings and statues from around the world. The rooms are clean, newly renovated (at least in the part of the hotel we stayed in), comfortable, and the views are excellent whether its mountain or ocean. The property is huge and I mean HUGE, but it has to be to fit all the amazing things it offers. Walking along the ocean you will see fish and sea turtles sunning themselves. There is a large man made lagoon with a waterfall where you can swim alongside fish and turtles, or you can just sit on the white sand and enjoy the day. There are paddle boards, small paddle boats, snorkeling equipment, etc for rent there as well. You can even swim with the dolphins, but I suggest you make reservations well in advance because so many people want to have this experience. There are also several pools, one of which is adults only for those of you who want a quiet area to sun and swim. There is a small slide in one pool, and a much larger one in the huge main pool. The main pool even has an area set aside for kids with real sand for them to play in. Bring plenty of sun screen though because the weather in Waikoloa is usually warm and sunny year round. The location of this hotel is perfect. Only a few minutes away from excellent restaurants and shopping. The town of Kailua Kona is 30-45 minutes away if you want more shopping and restaurants. We have come here many times over the years, and it just keeps getting better and better. You can't go wrong with The Hilton Waikoloa Village. ", " Let me start by saying that this resort is huge and amazing decor as you walk through the halls. We arrived at 11AM on Friday and was not expecting our room to be ready but front desk was able to give us the great news that everything was ready for us. As brand new HHonors members, we were greeted with a few complimentary bottles of water, free in-room wifi, and the girl at the counter went out of her way to check Kama'aina rates and got us a great deal! They knew that my wife and I were traveling from Oahu with our 2 year old and placed us in the ocean tower right on the second floor. The boats went right past our lanai and our son loved to run out and waive when he heard them coming. Also, the kiddie pools were right downstairs which was so convenient! For those saying there is no way of telling when a tram/boat is coming must have poor eyesight because every tram stop there is a HUGE screen saying where and approx time the next one will arrive. Also shows where the boats are too.Food options are abundant at the resort but a little pricy. The pizza was really guys and we had a great dinner at KPC. As Hawaii locals we got a discount at every restaurant we ate at and some of the restaurants even had \"kids eat free under 4\"! They also do this great thing where kids get a colored band at every restaurant they eat at and if they collect 6 bands they get a free ice cream! Overall another great experience at Hilton Waikoloa and will definitely be back!Oh, one downside that we experienced was that valet does take a while on top of the long trek to get there so plan accordingly... And remember, you are in Hawaii so be patient and respectful to the workers and other guests. ", " Have a great room in the Lagoon Tower. I am watching the waves roll in and the air has a nice breezy. It could not get much better than this. There is a young man at the reception and his name is Nicholas and he alone has made our stay what it is ... perfect. Please look him up by name before or when you arrive.The hotel is very large and usually that is a minus point for me but at no time did I feel lost in the crowd. Please go and snorkel in their own private lagoon as it is safe and fed by natural sea water. Down the street is a bar called Tropics and they have the best happy hour for food and drinks from 3 until 6.As we all know, Hawaii is very expensive for food cost so stock up on your favorite things before you arrive..... You will have a fridge and there is laundry service that you may use to wash your clothes. Better yet, don't bring so many as I doubt that you will ware everything that you bring. Have fun!!! ", " We had an amazing time! We've stayed here many times through the years, and it's always been so wonderful. The staff is always very helpful and friendly...and my kids love the paddle boarding in the lagoon. Jen Bolstad was extra helpful in making our trip magical! ", " What can I say, that has not already been said about this property. I can say that I cant believe some of the negative reviews people write...I still cant believe someone can say this property is not Hawaii....ARE YOU KIDDING ME? REALLY? The grounds of this property is natural Hawaii. My family has been to this property three separate times, beginning in 2014. We just recently came back from a 12 night vacation and stayed at the Palace Tower. The grounds are nothing less than Hawaiian perfection. The resort is gorgeous!!! The staff is so nice. A great shout out to Sally at the Buffet in the morning. She is great. So is Linda. I really dont know where to begin in describing this resort. We love it!!! It has so much to do or do nothing. The lagoon is a natural wonder for start. There are turtles that enter the lagoon in the morning from the ocean and love to eat the leaves and flowers that fall in the water overnight at the edge of the rocks. The tropical fish are abundant. You can go snorkeling and you wont see as much fish outside the lagoon, as you will in. It will take me hours to describe the natural beauty of this place. Just look at some of the photographs. The photos speak louder than words. Yes the resort is large and some people maybe overwhelmed at first, but there is a train to take you all over the resort and a separate boat. Kids just love to ride both for no reason from one end of the resort to the other. The pools are amazing too. Beautifully done. Our son also loves all the slides and the dolphins you can watch as well. His favorite place for lunch is the Lagoon Grill. We really enjoyed ourselves so much again, that I am bringing my mother for her 70th Birthday to Hilton Waikoloa Village. She is so excited to go there. I cant wait to go back on this mother daughter trip. For those who want to know, all the Towers are good. We've stayed in all of them. It really depends on what you want to do and where you want to be. For example I thought the Palace Tower is really convenient for everything. It is in the middle of the resort and newly redone. Ocean Tower for peace and quiet, and Lagoon Tower if you want to be closer to the dolphins and the main pool. I cant say enough about the staff. As anywhere, there were some minor issues, but the staff was so accommodating. They will do everything, within reason of course, to make the trip memorable for the guest. They definitely doing something right and it shows. I really think that this is probably the most beautiful property I have ever been to. Yes it can be expensive, but I think that is expected, and worth every penny. If you are considering this place, dont consider just go. ", " My husband and I were looking to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary so we decided once again to use Melissa Harmon from Beach Bum Vacations again. We decided on Hilton Waikoloa in Hawaii which has always been our dream destination. It was better than expected. We stayed in the Ocean Tower. The room was clean, spacious and the view from our room was perfect. We had a outside sitting area that overlooked the Waikoloa Beach Golf Course and the water. We are golfers so to us we couldn't have asked for more. We had a package which included breakfast, 3 course dinner and drinks throughout the day. We had our choice of 5 restaurants which gave us several choices. The only thing I want to mention which may not be for everyone is that you have a lot of working within the Hilton Waikoloa Village. They do provide trams and boats but sometimes it required you to have to wait, so we walked a lot. The grounds are beautiful so there is so much to see. ", " The Hilton at Wailkoloa is really amazing. It has a mono rail looking tram or a boat to take you to your building. The staff is very friendly and the pool is gigantic. The drinks such as smoothies or lava flows are so creamy and excellent at the pool bar. The lagoon has tons of turtles and fish to snorkel with and then there is Dolphin quest where you can swim with dolphins. Just an amazing place to stay. ", " This is by far the most spectacular hotel I have stayed in on the Island. The hotel is MASSIVE with lots of amenities and every aspect of the hotel is beautiful. Once you check in you can take tram or gondola to the room, which is really neat. I do wish that the hotel would do a better job with keep cats under control. ", " Outstanding resort! Great for kids or without. Beautiful location, great service, great spa, great variety of restaurants, shops, and activities. You will NOT be disappointed! Rent a 4-Wheel drive vehicle, so you won't be limited as to where you can travel on the island. Be sure to go horseback riding in Waipio and get some local cuisine. Lava Lava Beach Club is an awesome restaurant to check out too. ", " I just got back from the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the big island. It was amazing, from the staff to the grounds, to the resturants...Just perfect....Just beautiful...It was a short drive from Kona, and easy to get across the island to Hilo.....The staff was welcoming and pleasant no matter what job they had at the resort...The pools, lagoon were amazing, great for families at any age...they had a boat and tram to get around the resort, which came in handy. The resturants were pricey but there were shopping centers on the way into the resort that were good and better priced.... What a wonderful trip we had, we hated to leave. The rooms were comfortable and clean. They had classes for all ages -- very reasonable or free... ", " I can't say enough about the Hilton Waikoloa VIllage, It was a short drive from the airport (20min)....The staff -no matter the job, were pleasant and helpful...The room was large and the pools were amazing. They held classes on things like hula, ukalele, lei making classes. they had water activites at the lagoon. The grounds were well maintained and just beautiful...There were a number of choices for resturants (but they were pricey) ....Just down the street were wonderful shopping centers... We just loved our stay there....It was convienent to Kona,...We just loved it there, I can't say enough about it. ", " I've seen this hotel described as Disney World -it totally is and I loved it! There's a monorail running through the resort to get to all areas easily. There is everything on property you need - great big pool (although it should have been heated as it got chilly), small beach area (it is the big island, you're surrounded really by lava not sand), dolphin experience (amazing to swim with the Dolphins and worth every expensive penny!), luau (great show!), and I think 9 restaurants. Is the food mostly overpriced? Well, yes you're in Hawaii. We bought breakfast staples to have in the room to cut down on costs but otherwise ate on property. Italian restaurant was good, pool bar was fine, I'd pass on the Mexican if I go again. Great staff. Renovated room. Highly recommend! ", " We just finished a 5 night stay at Hilton Waikoloa and had a lovely time. We were part of a group of families with kids aged 9-12 and this resort was perfect for us. Based on other reviews we opted to upgrade to the Lagoon Tower, and upgraded further for a lagoon view, which was well worth the extra $. We lucked out with a first floor room with a walk-out to the lagoon. This gave us a lanai with sun loungers plus a grassy area for the kids to play on with direct access to paths to the rest of the resort & lagoon. The Lagoon Tower was closest to the pools that we enjoyed most, the lagoon , the lobby, Big Island Breakfast and self parking. The room was quiet, comfortable, and spacious - included plenty of closet and drawer storage space, as well as a 2 sink vanity with drawers for toiletries. We had a package that included Big Island Breakfast for 2 each day which helped get our day started off well nourished (although not likely that I would have paid $32 adult / $16 child every day for this) but the buffet choices were plentiful, and included cooked to order eggs and omelettes. The kids loved using the tram and boats to explore the resort. We had one adult dinner at KPC and loved it! Try to make a reservation to catch sunset - beautiful! The food was delicious, service was great and the restaurant is pricey as you would expect. We ordered take out from Dona & Toni's Pizza for the kids, which they really enjoyed. We were off property for a lot of activities (Volcanoes National Park & a Snorkel Sail) and we walked to a nearby beach (in front of the Marriott) and had a fun day there too.We utilized the near-by Queen's Marketplace to pick up food/snacks from Island Gourmet Marketplace for other meals as well. The pool was fun and we all enjoyed the water slide. All in all a great place to stay if you are travelling as a family. ", " Great hotel for our group of friends. We stayed in Makai section and the rooms were perfect. We had amazing views of the resort and ocean. Loved all the restaurants and spa. Everyone we interacted with was so kind and focused on service. We can't see enough great things about this hotel and can't wait to come back! ", " Me and my family enjoyed every minute of our stay here. 1. Comparing the price of other hotels, it was a good deal. 2. Food was good but little pricey. 3. Pool and Lagoon was awesome. 4. The dolphin experience was excellent. 5. We wished the tram was running more frequently. ", " Magical grounds, art, views, pools, room, and more. Tasteful and comfortable room in Hale Ike Tower with ocean view. The luau is fantastic with great food, service, and memorable show. Worth the splurge! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a very special place for my wife and me. We started going there when it was a Hyatt in 1989, built for $400+ million, the most expensive hotel ever at that time. With everything brand new then, 2 functioning monorails and numerous boats to travel the resort, a live orchestra at night, upscale rooms, celebrities, it was a site to behold. Rooms were also $500 plus then. The market crashed in the early 90's, and Hilton bought the depressed property for $55 million. Hilton has done a great job for 20 plus years, particularly given the enormous costs/infrastructure needed. My wife and I were married at the resort in 1994, and have spent over 6 months in the hotel over the years, most recently this week. I can honestly say one is hard pressed to find a more beautiful property anywhere, or a better hotel value in Hawaii. The hotel has aged gracefully, and the recent room refurbishing is excellent. The beds, linens, tv and climate control are all very nice. Only 2 large towels in our room was surprising. One must be very careful not to get a room next to the elevator if the adjacent floor is tiled, as the sound of every step and suitcase going by are magnified (we changed rooms, well handled by the managerial staff, and a minor inconvenience). Give yourself extra time to walk most of the time, as the monorail and boats are now infrequent and slow. This is actually a major plus(unless one is toting kids, luggage or has trouble walking) as the hallways are filled with spectacular art one would otherwise miss, and we all need to work off the pina coladas and great meals from Imari (top Japanese restaurant). The real beauty of the resort is the caring staff, many of whom we have known for 20+ years. The gorgeous lagoon, the dolphins nearby, the sunsets at Buddha point. The amazing white cockatoo Butterscotch gracing the lobby with his charm. A week is probably not enough time to experience all the joys of the Hilton Waikoloa, many of which will be remembered on the flight home, or during a moment at work a few months later. But it's a good start. Special thanks this trip to Lucky in the bird/landscape area, and Amy, who really really helped us out. And to Sheldon and Jo, whose Aloha spirit in the valet area confirmed why we'll always find a way to come back. ", " Wonderful resort within walking distance from two shopping centers and lots of great restaurants. It is only 17 miles from the Kona Airport and the shops and restaurants of Kona. I recommend renting a car and using the valet parking. It is only $5 more than self parking and it will save you a lot of time. The staff was very attentive. Beautiful surroundings and great views. The resort is extremely kid friendly with lots of activities. All of the facilities were very clean and constantly maintained by the staff. I highly recommend staying at the Waikoloa Hilton. ", " I am on another vacation and comparing to the experience we had three months ago at the Hilton Waikoloa. Great management team. Wonderful check in and upgrade at check in for our entire family. We travelled with my brother and sisters families and my parents. Fifteen of us in total. Clean rooms, great ocean view and resort, and sunsets to die for. Stay at Makai tower. It's well located and has best pool. My kids could not stay away from the tropical pool and water slide that was made to resemble a volcanic rock. Many kids to play with and tons to do. Loved using water equine eg water bikes, paddle boards. We had attached room in Makai tower. Kids in one huge room with two queen beds. We had king bed room. Both had large balconies and we sat everyday and watched the sunset as they lit the lights all the way around the property. Only complaint is lack of umbrellas - be prepared to secure a spot early. Also the cabanas are a not large or worth the expense. Imagine a lounge chair with a top. Loved seeing the island. Go to Volcano and hike. Amazing!!! They made you feel like all they wanted to do was make your experience delightful! ", " We had a wonderful trip to the Hilton. Been to Hawaii numerous times and found this resort to be the most interesting. The monorail and water taxi's to shuttle you around are such a cool novelty but completely avoidable if you want to walk (or not wait). The food was exceptional. We purchased an all inclusive package (for Hawaii?!?!) on the costco website and found the value to be very good. What a treat to have beautiful drinks and meals and just relax. We ventured out a bit but you could easily just hang out here. The only downer is a personal preference to have no dolphins in captivity. Their pool is painfully small and people whistle and jeer at them all day and night - felt awful for them (our room was overlooking in Makai - should have been amazing, and for those who like that sort of thing it would be but we probably should have asked to be moved so we weren't reminded each time on our deck - note to others who feel strongly about captive dolphins). But overall we absolutely LOVED our stay - hospitality was extraordinary - special shout out to the hosts at the Breakfast - they do an amazing job of smiling through all the hungry patrons. And a shout out to the Director of Hospitality who wrote me an email mid stay to see if everything was enjoyable and if there was anything they could do to let them know - very charming (I could have mentioned the dolphins but moving is such a pain!) The breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen anywhere so if nothing else get a pkg with it included (otherwise prepare to shell out $37pp each morning.) Thank you Hilton! You outdid yourselves! (An anniversary surprise would have been a nice touch if they want to take it to the next level). ", " Excellent staff and great location on the Big Island of Hawaii. I like the pool here way better than the Hilton Hawaiian Village as it is much less crowded and in the sun more. Great water slides and amazing views. The rooms are very clean and pretty much standard Hilton fare and have amazing views. ", " We already had a condo booked for 10 nights but decided to use points to stay 1 night at the Hilton to see what it was all about. Let's just say it is a superb playground.The grounds are beautiful and the network or pools are amazing with an environment to suite any taste. In our case we have little boys who really enjoyed the lagoon sand and waters as well as the zero entry kids pool with sand. There were also many other pools we didn't even get to including an adult pool where one can avoid the endless squeals of joy from all the kids having a blast. Our boys also got a kick out of riding the tram and boat across the property over and over again. I myself preferred the walk as there are all sorts of interesting things to see from flamingos to artwork.The service was also outstanding. I like that they left a voicemail message on the room phone and texted to ask if there were any concerns. Inaccurate billing is a pet peeve of mine and my leisure credit of $50 was missing from my bill. The front desk corrected the error on the phone and emailed the revised bill immediately so I didn't have to make a trip to the front desk. We also stayed on the property beyond our check out time and they did not take issue with that or the late towel return. Regarding the room, we ended up in the ocean tower with a view of the ocean over the golf course from the lanai. It was a beautiful extra we didn't pay for. The king bed was great quality and the sofa pullout for the kids was very decent too. The room was in good condition (carpeting and walls) and the furnishing were nice Hawaiian style. Minor issues with the room; the sink and toilet were slow to drain/flush. The only downside is the dining. As a captive audience at our destination stop, we were very reluctant to get the car and venture out for a meal. We visited the orchid market for mid-day snacks. The cafeteria style snacks are just ordinary and modestly priced for the property. i.e. my salad was $14 and fries for each kid $4, and a local can of local lager $7. We were really disappointed with the Italian reataurant where we had dinner. it is a nice venue with outdoor seating that takes advantage of the sunset while the boats float by and milk fish jump out of the water. The ambience will almost make you forget that the pizza has minimal cheese and gross crust (yeast was dead if you know your pizza breads). I can recommend the spaghetti and meatballs but again because it is modestly priced but not because it is a memorable dish. Overall, we really, really. liked the resort and our camera is loaded with great family memories so we will definitely come back again for everything but the food. sent from my Android. Please excuse any misspellings/auto-corrections ", " After reading a lot of negative reviews, I really thought that this was going to be a horrible vacation. But thankfully, I was mistaken! From the minute we stepped there, all we got was attention, care, and help. We reached the resort around 10 pm. My younger one was very hungry and I was worried with it being so late and the town and resort facilities basically all shutting down by 9 pm (we were unaware at that point of the hours for the Queens' Market Place nearby), and right away a very nice lady (Marla I think?) stopped the tram and ran to get us milk. we stayed in the Makai at the Lagoon tower. We wanted a fan in the room and received one immediately. The luggage came in 20 mins or so. Our bathroom had a nasty urine smell and they addressed the matter promptly; we had some fridge issues and they swapped them out 3 times until we had one that worked properly. Ryan (manager) helped us with those myriad issues and even changed our room. We were so appreciative of how they listened to our concerns and complaints and did their very best to resolve them. The cleaning ladies on the 1st and 6th floors respectively were great and we never forgot to tip them. Each and every person working there greeted us and always smiled. Laundry was on the 4th floor and ice was right around the laundry room (as well as every floor in same spot in the middle of a floor). The laundry machine and dryer machine each accepted credit card, but for detergent you need $2 for the vending machine with several detergent options. The tram and boat were very useful to get from end to end of the resort when not up for a walk (it is probably a 15 min walk from one end to the other). The Kona pool was a lot of fun; the kids had their tubes and tiny rafts and there was a real cool slide (kids have to be above 42\" and no vests allowed ).They provide bracelets specifically for people staying at Makai to use the Kona pool. Orchid Marketplace by the Kona pool had good pizza ($13, they offer 2 pre-planned daily specials) and shaved ice ($6) but it closed at 3 pm !!! It was hard to get kids something to drink or eat if they were still in the pool after 3 pm. I really wish and hope that they change this. Take an umbrella as you will not get shade anywhere at the pool or any of the beaches. We bought one from Whalers (King's Shops) for $17 which wasn't very strong for the winds, but we later found a 7' Tommy Bahama umbrella at Costco for $23 which was very sturdy. I found the prices on the island in every store to be same. I loved Island Gourmet @ Queens' MarketPlace (it had everything you would want to shop - food, clothes, gifts etc. for same prices as any other store); Target and Walmart in Kona had similar (if not exactly) prices as in IL locations that I shop at. The veggie pizza at Dona and Toni's pizza was good and the staff was great. They put a mini bed together with chairs and table cloths for my young one to sleep on comfortably while we ate our meal.Buddha point by Ocean towers was beautiful and very peaceful. I loved walking there everyday. Sunset views from there were amazing! The lagoon was very murky and it made us really sad. We saw 3 Honus by the waterfall and it was so much fun to watch them while we paddled our boat ($28 for 30 min / $33 for 60 min). It is not easy to walk in it because of no visibility and super sharp rocks. If you can take your own inflatable rafts, you will enjoy a lot. You will not get any shade as there are very limited Tiki huts - buy an umbrella, you will save yourself a lot of pain.The Waikoloa Coffee station in Makai towers was okay but it closed at 6 pm. The special waffle ($12.50) hardly had any whipped cream or strawberries :( Nutty Hawaiian Latte was my favorite, and the smoothies were decent.Valet parking was very comfortable and helpful. Just call them 30 mins before you head out and your car will be waiting for you most of the times. Morning hours are very busy for them, so plan well.Dolphin Quest was a lot of fun. We selected the 45 min deluxe package. It was $269 per person, and because of our 5 yr old, 1 parent had to join (and pay) as well - they gave us 20% off for the parent. The dolphins are very well taken care of and it was fun to watch them. We were also able to see them from our room in Makai tower.The resort was very clean . An army of people cleaned it every morning and throughout the day.It is so wonderful to walk around and enjoy the amazing sculptures on this resort. We enjoyed our 10 day stay at Hilton Waikoloa very much and will happily return. Hats off to them for working as a team and making our vacation so special :) We thank each and every one of them.Just a note for people who suffer from altitude sickness/nausea due to mountainous driving, this place is far from most of the sight seeing places and drive to those nice places is not fun at all. ", " We love huge hotels, and this Hilton is a monster. All the positive things people have to say are true, we couldn't fault a thing. From the initial greetings from valets and front desk, to the big banyan breakfast on our last day, we really enjoyed it all. We're \"retirement age\" (meaning old) but had no problem walking all over the property, taking a boat or tram if we wished. Our top-floor room in the Ocean Tower overlooked Buddha Point, so the view from the balcony was spectacular. The room was huge, with a spacious vanity outside the bathroom, very quiet and the Wi-Fi worked very well. One thing I really liked was the HHonors voucher system ... I'm a Diamond member and there's no Executive Lounge at this property, so they gave me \"breakfast vouchers\" that I could use for any food any time. I hate getting up for breakfast on vacation, so this was really a great idea. ", " After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a little apprehensive. That all changed as soon as I entered the Lobby. Checking in-easy. I used the Hilton Honors Line, only a 5 minute wait. We quickly received our packet, and hopped on the monorail for the first stop Makai at Lagoon Towers. Oops I did use the online checking app, which the receptionist said helped.We have a mountain view room, with partial ocean view as well.The room is stunning, large, 2 queen beds ,1 large dresser , 3 night stands, and a closet. Tons of storage. Bathroom has a long vanity, shower,bath combo.Nicely decorated, newly renovated, beds are so comfy. Pod style coffeemaker.We have 2 teenagers with us and they are loving the property. Food is \u00fcber expensive, we had drip coffee large at Waikioloa Coffee outside our room for $11.00 for 2 people.It was good and extremely hot...but no way worth it.You can go to Queens market Island Gourmet for .99 cents coffee. We also got dinner to go last night rice and steak for $5.99 from there. They have affordable options.Overall so very pleased with the resort. Personnel friendly and helpful.Great Valet service, quick, friendly and efficient.We chose to eat off property as we have a car with the exception of a few snacks, ice cream for the teens. ", " Something for everyone at this large resort! Stayed in the makai area which was in the newer rooms I believe. Good, clean rooms with a balcony. Kids loved the boat rides, seeing all the fish and turtles. Don't miss the amazing breakfast buffet which was included in our package. Definitely coming back! ", " Spent 5 nights there at conference. What an amazing resort. Everything catered for. We had an amazing view from our ocean tower room. Despite this resort very casual in terms of dress, which was a little unexpected in our experience. Swimming pools great, lots of places to eat, teppan yaki particularly superb in Japanese restaurant Amari.Car essential as distances huge and a bit like Disneyland in terms of distance from rooms to foyer. However a wonderful experience overall. Laundry facility and ability to bring your own tea and coffee a real bonus. Lovely shops on the resort also and plenty of variety for early morning runs with great gym. ", " Booked 2 nights, excellent greeting at the front, fast, friendly check in. Stayed in the Ocean Tower. Loved it!!! Everything was fabulous!! Asked for extra towels, blanket and pillows and it was waiting for us in the room before we got there. Sink wasn't draining properly, let the front desk know and it was resolved before we got back to the room. Planning another Staycation soon!! Mahalo Hilton Staff!! ", " We stayed in the makai rooms, I would recomend them for location and updates. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The property is beautiful the snorkeling on property was better than the other public beach we tried it from. loved all the animals all over the property. do a sunset dinner at KPC for sure. food was great and whales were jumping as the sun set while we ate. also loved all the cats, birds, mongoose, turtles, fish eels. It was amazing. hotel made it easy to catch transportation to the excursions we planned off site and to local shopping. ", " Just spent 2 nights here, and will stay again our next visit. Check in was fast and efficient, with even the concierge checking people in. I had booked a basic room, and was offered an ocean view for additional $20 per night. So worth it, the view is gorgeous. The room was spacious with a large lanai, the beds were comfy. Had planned to visit a nearby beach during our stay but the kid (9 yr old) was having so much fun with all the pols and activities at the lagoon that we just stayed on the resort grounds, which were Beautiful! Big plus was being able to watch the dolphin activity even though we did not do the interactive experience. Be prepared for some extra expenses with the activities, but all in all we highly recommend this place. ", " This was a perfect place to stay for our honeymoon! Everyone was very welcoming and we only wish we would have spent a little more time on the resort to fully utilize it's exquisite facilities! We especially loved the snorkeling available in the lagoon and out into the bay. ", " Had a great time with my 9mnth & 3 yr old children. The younger slept alot however my 3 yr old thoroughly enjoyed the water slides, dolphin pool, train rides around the property, and the free boat rides(starting from 2pm)!Although the resort is spread out, you have the transport of the free train or boat. Its also a lovely walk, they have themed walkway areas as you approach the different towers from european influences near the Ocean tower, east asian influences near the palace tower region and throughout the main lobby and other parts of the resort (seems to be main theme of resort), the Grand Promenade has great info on Hawaiian culture and the arts. Near the Lagoon tower you have Polynesian influences leading you south towards the Luau grounds!The Legends of Hawaii Luau is spectacular! Young vibrant dancers, staff who smile and try their best to give you the best experience, good food and a great variety of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages!This is the 4th time here, we enjoy the family fun activities this resort provides.Like any resort the restaurants can be pricey however part of the cost is the atmosphere, sunset dinners, open air dining. This is hard to achieve anywhere other than Hawaii!!Okay... now take a deep breath and book with confidence because you'll enjoy it!! ", " Really great place to stay! Beautiful hotel grounds and awesome employees. The art work on display in the \"hallways\" was awesome. If you are looking for the ultimate resort experienc I would highly recommend this place. ", " We had a wonderful time in Hawaii. It was even more fun than we thought it would be. Everything was made so easy for us. It was a very pleasant experience. The concerage was always handy to answer any questions we had. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa village from March 6th to 13th. From check in to check out, it was a dream vacation. At check in, I asked the clerk if there were some upgrades available. He checked, and said \u201cyes, I can give you an ocean front\u201d. We had booked an ocean view, we wanted to make sure we would see the ocean; we got the full deal with the ocean front. We could see the whales from our balcony. In the morning, I was opening the curtains and we could watch them from our bed. WOW. I put some pictures taken from the balcony. Peak times were 7AM and from 2PM to sunset. It was also a premium location to watch sunset. The room was big, clean, and quiet with a big walk-in to put the suitcases in. The fact that we were at the end of the ocean tower helped for sure for the quietness. The only negative point is that it was a communicating room. We could hear very clearly the neighbors on the other side of the door when they were there. Luckily, they were very quiet.  I\u2019m a diamond HHonnors member, and I know that when I go a Hilton property, I will have a great service. They proved it once again. We received an email from the resident manager asking how was our stay and saying to contact him if there was anything they could do for us. We wanted to go see the Luau, but I\u2019m allergic to fish and shellfish, and I\u2019m afraid of those buffet were people can use the utensil they took for the fish to go in the chicken. So I replied to the email mentioning that and asking if they had other options. He replied right away saying he had contacted the culinary team. I received a call from the culinary service manager saying that if we wanted to assist to the Luau, they could prepare a plate for me before they put the food in the buffet. I could hardly believe it. That\u2019s what I call an amazing service. He took care of the reservation, we arrived there, they were aware of my allergies and were very careful. The plate they brought me was very well prepared, full, hot and delicious. My wife and I had a wonderful evening. The property is very clean and well groomed. There is a lagoon were you can swim with fish and turtles (bring your snorkel gear). We were in and out of the resort, discovering the island, and we saw a lot of turtles when we were at the hotel. The lagoon is good for families with kids, it goes down slowly. A small negative point, there are not a lot of palapas on the beach, and the shade is rare. We had brought our own sunshade that we were attaching to the chairs, it was perfect. You can also rent chairs for 2 with sunshades on it. I don\u2019t know the rate. The property is very big, but there is a tram available all day and evening, and boats in the evening. We were walking most of the time. BTW, if you book with points, you don\u2019t pay the resort fees. That was a good saving for us as we were there 7 nights. I can\u2019t tell if partial booking works (point and money), we had booked all the nights with points.Pros- Great service, very helpful personnel- Very nice property- Amazing ocean view- Multiple pools and a nice lagoon where you can snorkel- Calm and relaxingCons- More shade would be good at the beach- Long walk to the parking lot ", " We stayed and had a wonderful time. It is a beautiful setting and the staff was very nice and helpful. For being such a large property the crowd spreads out well and it never feels crowded. The KPC restaurant is excellent. ", " This resort is huge. You really to have to take the tram or boats if you are carrying anything besides a beach bag. Long walks to your room. You need to allow extra time to get anywhere, since the tram can take awhile. The resort is beautiful. There is something for everyone to do. Keep in mind it is a Hilton, so you will pay Hilton prices for food, drinks and amenities. We chose to eat off the property. Lava Lava Beach Club is a great place to watch the sunset and have dinner. Still a bit pricey but not as bad as the resort. We ate at the food court a couple nights too. Rooms are large and clean. Beds were comfortable. All staff was superior Hilton quality. ", " Great resort and really good home base for exploring the rest of the Big Island. Make sure you spend plenty of time at the pool and go see Lawrence for one of his '180 Seconds' cocktails, you wont be disappointed! ", " This is my first time read a review for any hotel. I have to say this vacation was the best vacation for my wife and I. We got to Hilton around 9pm and we were so tired but kriztine made us feel so welcomed. The next morning I went down to the front desk and talked to Janice, she also made me feel welcomed. Then I asked for the manger because the two ladies were so helpful. And I have to say I see why they were so welcoming. Ryan, the Assistant director front office operation was the best and he also made our vacation even better. He was the best and the info and what he helped us out with will be remembered and never forgotten. He helped us with valet he gave us the best view that will be remembered forever. I was so sad I had to leave but I PREMISE we will go back soon. The service was so great I don't want to go anywhere else. If you're go to visit them you have to get in touch with Ryan and tell him you're coming cause he'll make you feel welcome and he will do his best to make sure you taken care of. Tell him Dunbar sent you and he'll know who you're talking about. Haha best ever!!!! 1-808-886-1234 ext. 2714 email Ryan.tomm@hilton.com ", " This is a great group of Hotels and timeshare property. There are three main hotels on the property and they surround the protected lagoon that opens into the ocean. There are two shopping areas the King's Market and the Queens market with everything you need if you do not wish to leave the property but it is Hawaii. Blue Hawaii helicopters pick up right out the front gate and the property is in a great spot to jump off for many adventures. There are plenty of great beaches on and close the the property and lots of hiking for the outdoors type. On a clear day you can see both volcanoes and Parker ranch. You are surrounded by the lava field from the 1800's so not a lot of green once you leave the property but 10 miles in any direction and you are back in the green Hawaii. Kona is about 12 miles south and the north shore is about 40 minutes up the highway. ", " I have never visited the Big Island so for my 9th visit to our 50th state I started here. The Hilton Waikoloa is one of the most spectacular properties I have ever visited. The grounds are massive but it only took me a couple of hours to find my way around. A tram, a boat, and my feet helped me get around this massive hotel. All staff have gone out of their way to help me enjoy myself. I want to bring my grand children next time. A very busy place for kids to really enjoy themselves. I hate to leave but I have to. ", " We came to Hawaii to celebrate with my parents for their 70th anniversary. They love Hawaii. We are Diamond members and I called ahead since my parents arrived before us. Their room was upgraded to an ocean front room in the ocean tower. Mike assisted them at check in and was kind and very helpful. He really made them feel special. When we arrived, Mike also helped check us in at the Hhonors desk. He remembered my parents right away and booked us in an ocean front room 3 doors down from them. Being Diamond members we have stayed at Hilton properties around the world. Hilton should be proud that Mike represents them. He even followed up with a text later in the day to see if we needed anything. What a great way for guests to feel valued. The resort remains a favorite of ours. The grounds are beautiful with unbelievable views. It is true paradise. We will be back in December to this amazing property. ", " Loved it, only problem were the Mynah birds that kept cackling all thru the night. I was located at the Ocean Tower on the 6th floor right in front of the treetops. If you are a visitor, I recommend a room away from the trees. Then you won't be bothered by the birds. ", " Stayed here for a week of in March 2016 for a conference. The facilities were pristine and very well-maintained. The gardens and beach front setting, with gorgeous views of the mountains and crashing surf, were breathtaking. The property is varied with lots of activities, a nice walking trails and pretty paths, golf course close by, live dolphin experience, turtles, fun water craft equipment, splash pools, slides and swimming pools to enjoy. There is an excellent spa and gym facility, never over crowded during my stay. There is a monorail for those with mobility issues, or kids who like the fun of a train ride, as well as a motorboat shuttle system that looked like fun. Poolside bar and food service, several restaurants and very nice daily breakfast buffet. It was great for families with kids and for couples, too. Because it is such a large property, it never felt crowded or busy. There is a convenient shuttle into the local village with pretty shopping centers and restaurants. Front desk staff including Nicholas, dining room staff including David and Rose, and general hotel staff including David (who helped me find the downstairs lobby!) were all very helpful and kind. I loved every minute I spent here. ", " We have been enjoying our vacation from the second we arrived on site at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort on the Big Island. Here is one example of how they went above and beyond to earn my business:My wife received a bad sunburn and happened to leave her Aloe Gel in the car that is in Valet from the night before. I texted the customer service number and explained the situation, that happened to be at 5:30 in the morning. She was in pain and needed some relief immediately!They not only went to the car and found the gel but sent someone to deliver to our room which was across the property and nowhere near the Valet. They also texted to confirm we received the gel and we're happy with the service. We love how texting a request to the customer service number is so easy and you receive a person responding every time, and promptly.This is just one example of how they go above and beyond to make everyone's experience top notch!Thank you and Mahalo!Scott Family ", " From the minute we checked into this hotel and were greeted at the front desk by Nicholas (who was such a wonderful guy and made us feel right at home) until the minute we checked out, this place was A+++!!! Our kids were crying when we were checking out we had such a GREAT time there!! In fact, we never left the resort once the entire time we were there!! The food was great, the room and view was awesome, we overlooked the dolphins and saw whales from our balcony every morning and late in the afternoon!! The staff was spectacular too, everyone was so helpful and happy, that makes a world of difference when you stay somewhere, you want to feel at home, welcomed and comfortable. The girls who work at Shaka Cones were so friendly and nice, Carolyn at the Lagoon Grill, Kim who drives the tram and boat, and our favorite of the trip was Alexandra Shlitter who works at Dolphin Quest! It was so wonderful to be able to sit and eat and watch the dolphins, sit on our balcony and watch them and the views were incredible!! We loved the tram and the boat riding up and down the canal to eat or go to the other pool. We are already planning our next trip there!! Love this place and everything about it! ", " The hotel is amazing! The property is beautiful with beaches, pools, natural pools, river, boats and monorail for transportationRooms are clean, well furnished and the view is breathless Staff is warm and helpful ", " We were here as part of our honeymoon and enjoyed ourselves very much. We think this would be perfect for young families with children. The man made lagoon with fresh sea water in the middle of the resort is amazing- beautiful and fun. And the tram within the resort is just insane! That's how big the property is - 63acres I think! The big island is filled with adventure and activities! We only had 3 days here but could easily spend more time on the island to enjoy both the hotel and the activities outside! Seems like all tours will depart from this resort as well so it's super easy to get around ", " We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in the Lagoon Tower. Rooms in this tower have impressive views over the lagoon, the dolphin swimming area as well as the ocean and all have good-sized balconies. The hotel is quite large and they have done well keeping it clean and well-maintained. In-room wireless internet is available and is fast and reliable. There are gym facilities and a spa although I did not use them and cannot comment on them directly. From a quick glance of the gym, it appeared to be well-stocked with a large number of treadmills and other machines as well as weights. It was tucked away in the back of the hotel and did not have any views to inspire those individuals that might need some inspiration to work out. There are several restaurants to choose from on site however, they are quite expensive even for Hawaiian standards and other options exist a short walk away at the Queens and Kings shopping areas. ", " This is one of those resorts you need to experience at least once in your lifetime. Unique, beautiful and relaxing that has something for everyone! Adults, Kids, Grandma and Grandpa! Take the tram or boat, swim with the dolphins, enjoy the spa or just read a book in a hammock with the waves crashing below you. Awesome! ", " Very nice hotel, the people and service were fantastic. The room we had offered a gorgeous view of the ocean and a golf course. The room and the entire hotel was very clean and well kept. The food was good at KPC and The Breakfast buffet. The grounds of the hotel are extensive and a tram is used to convey people from the lobby to hotel rooms. The tram and waiting for it was the only bad part of the entire stay at the hotel. I wasted several hours a day, unless my wife and I walked between buildings, waiting for the tram. The tram must be run more often. Other than that the stay was excellent. I must compliment the staff as being incredibly friendly and wanting to help the guests and make their stay more enjoyable. ", " The hotel, the grounds and the service are really outstanding. The restaurants are greatly overpriced but good. I guess you pay for the location. The rooms are large and very comfortable. Do not pay for a view as you will not spend much time in the room and they all have nice views. The dolphin experience is worth the price. ", " Great hotel for a relaxing vacation. All the staff were very friendly and the grounds were immaculate. From the relaxing beach in the lagoon to the boat shuttles, this entire property is set up for a pleasant experience ", " Fantastic activities oceanfront. Able to swim with dolphins and snorkel onsite. Friendly and helpful staff. Great accommodations. Great location. Shopping nearby. Many restaurants nearby. Golf onsite. Would return to this location. ", " My 19 year old daughter and I vacationed here for her college Spring Break. Loved the resort. Beautiful landscape, antiquities, artwork, amenities and staff. This is a huge resort. Best for folks who are very mobile, could be difficult for those who don't manage stairs well. Tram system as well as boats on the canal are helpful but still a walk to the beautiful pools and shore. Warning - this property does not have a \"beach\". You can follow a lovely trail beside the water about 1/2 a mile and reach a sandy beach if you want. The uniqueness of shore line is what makes the property incredible. Enjoy that. There are plenty of pools with plenty of comfortable chairs so no worries. Beach towels at towel hut. Take your card to claim. Plenty of restaurants on the property - everything from pizza to sushi and beyond. All fine that we tried. All pricey in keeping with Hawaii in general and resorts in general. Nice shopping and restaurant opportunities at the King and Queen shopping areas just a short walk or tram ride away. Valet parking is $30 a day - ouch! Self parking is $25 - still ouch! We stayed in the newly remodeled Royal Tower. Golf course and mountain view - lovely view of the telescopes on Mauna Kea on clear days. Square footage of the room was very large with 2 queen beds. Small bathroom, smaller closet and very little drawer space to unpack. I would assume that folks traveling that far - from most anywhere - will be there long enough to unpack. More drawer and closet space would be welcomed. I would return to this property and highly recommend it. Spa was lovely, workout facilities are well equipped, lots to see and do on the property, very clean, helpful and friendly staff. Stunning setting. Enjoy! ", " Beautiful. The views from our room were amazing, and the grounds around the resort were very well kept. Lot's of activities including the Dolphin Swim (definitely recommended if you've never done it), the Luau, the water Taxi and Tram, all add up to make the resort very unique. Car rental available on site made sight seeing easy, although not particularly inexpensive. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a superior property on the Kahala Coast of Hawaii. The grounds are gorgeous, and there is so much do at the resort. The lagoon is great for water sports, swimming and snorkeling and it is close to other beaches if you have a car. There is so much to do and see if you are adventurous or the perfect place to relax and do nothing! ", " Pool staff are especially helpful and courteous. Rachel at the pool knew all the childern by name, when she was supervising the slide. Excellent service! The poolside meals are a bit expensive for what you receive but to be expected at a Hilton resort. Beautiful property. ", " We were met at the front with a very helpful service staff. The hotel covers a wide property. The hotel provides two forms of transportation to move around the property: Tram and boat. These run on a regular basis with defined stops. There is an electronic display at stops showing the progress of each. We were initially assigned a room furthest from the elevators. Because of mobility issues my wife has, we asked for and were granted as similar room nearer the elevator. The property has been designed to be accessible, even for wheelchairs. There are several restaurants of various levels available. The spa is very upscale, with expansive separate facilities for men and women. There is no beach at the ocean, only piles of rocks. Instead, a lagoon has been made with an inlet from the ocean. There is a sandy beach in this area. There is also an extensive pool with lots of lounge chairs. There is nice self-service laundry available. The hotel even has a separate, lower lobby where we met our external tour. ", " We celebrated my mothers 90th birthday at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and she had a fantastic time. Special thanks to Yvonne in housekeeping and Ashley at the Lagoon Grill for extra special treatment of Mom! She loved snorkeling in the Lagoon and couldn't keep he off the big waterslide. She was a kid again and will never forget her visit ! ", " Came here to celebrate 25 years of marriage. Our room, a suite was super nice. The view is zen like. Love sitting on the balcony in the am. The staff is very nice. Had a few adult beverages, also very nice. Life is good. We are coming back. ", " We are always surprised that the resort is not rated among the Top Ten on Hawaii. Even though it is aging and is not maintained as spectacularly as it once was, it is still a perfect place to enjoy your time away from the reality and challenges of modern society.First - just enjoy the setting - the gardensSecond - stroll the grounds, take in the artwork, the exhibits, the ponds, the natureThird - snorkel the lagoon in the morning - before the crowdsFourth - enjoy the people who make this place work - a very dedicated group many long timers - who want you to be happy there.Just find a quiet place (?) in the late afternoon and evening and just let the day end - listen to the raucous chorus as the mynahs roostLife is good here. Yes, there are things to crab about - management could handle some situations better, but don't let that take away from the experience. ", " I couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in. This resort is a great place for people of all ages. So many great views, pools and activities that you don't even need to leave the hotel. They have a interactive dolphin adventure and several water activities for the lagoon. In addition, The restaurants and cafe's are exceptional. Poolside bars and buffets are another option we utilized. We dinned at the Kamuela Provision Co. and we we're very impressed with the food and the great ocean view from our cliff side table. I cannot say anything bad about this place. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were spacious, clean and had everything you could need. I would definitely spend the money to come back again, but next time, I would like to bring the entire family. As they say on the Island, Mahalo Hilton, for creating this fabulous hotel. ", " We spent three days here while island hopping for two weeks. This place is huge. We stayed in Lagoon Tower with views of the lagoon and dolphin pools that we never grew tired of. Yes, the lagoon is open to the ocean so snorkeling is a real adventure. You certainly will come face to face with turtles and some tropical fish. One afternoon the lagoon was off limits for a few hours because a monk seal decided to come in and look for some fresh fish for lunch. Getting around to the many venues, shops and restaurants is easy with a tram or boat ride. There are no ocean beaches, just great ocean views plus pools and the lagoon beach. There are lots of things to do for families or couples. We ate at a few of the restaurants but enjoyed the pizza place the most. The buffet breakfast was exceptional but at $30 each it should have been.A fat wallet is required since everything is pricey which is pretty standard in Hawaii. ", " This hotel was booked as a fluke. We called Hilton JFK to discuss leaving our car there while we flew to another destination. After we arranged for that parking, they asked us if we wanted to stay on the line for a sales presentation, so we said yes. We were offered discounted rates at one of about 5 different Hiltons in exchange for agreeing to take part in a timeshare presentation. Because the prices were such a wonderful discount, we said yes. We stayed at the Ocean Tower, where apparently everyone who agreed to this deal also stays. They put us in an ocean view room and it did not disappoint. The king bed was very comfortable and faced the sliding glass door view out to our own patio facing both the ocean and one of many pools. The room was clean and spacious with a fairly large walk-in closet. The room attendants took good care of us and room service breakfast on the balcony is a wonderful experience. The resort is also home to cats. We had three cats that seemed to be living in the immediate vicinity of our building. We thought this was entertaining but others may not. There was also a mongoose living among them, which was fun. I will point out, and I don't want to lessen my rating for this, but we did see a few roaches around the complex, but not in our room, thankfully. The staff seemed to be on this, as we saw an exterminator one day, and the cleaning crews were quick to sweep them off the sidewalks. The restaurants are fairly good. The best experience we had was hibachi/sushi at Imari, which is sadly only open for dinner. The Lagoon Grill, Boat Landing Cantina and Big Island Breakfast are all what you would expect for hotel restaurants - moderate to higher priced and average fare. We did not eat at the Kamuela Provision Company but should have. We ate off campus one night at Lava Lava Club next door and the food was good but it wasn't a great experience overall with slow service. The tram runs the length of the resort every 10 minutes or so, so if you don't want to walk you can take a short ride. Walking is totally doable, it just takes a little more time. Dolphin Quest offers an hour of time with several dolphins they have onsite and is a really fun experience. The lagoon offers paddle boating and boarding and a private small beach that is fed directly by the ocean, complete with fish. We loved all of these features. Several gift shops stock everything you may want for your room as well as plenty of gifts to bring home. We also did the evening Volcano tour that you can sign up for with the concierge. It was a full day of activities capped off by visiting a volcano crater and having dinner at Volcano Winery. Overall a wonderful experience. We were told that this Ocean Tower building we stayed in is going to be made into timeshare units in the future. We did, as it happens, purchase the timeshare and can't wait to go back and take our kids. The island has so much to offer and we feel like we have only scratched the surface. The Hilton Waikoloa is a great place to stay overall and we would definitely go back. ", " Spending my wife's presidents club trip here in Hawaii for the first time. Impressive!!! Our ocean view room is perfect with views of the pool, dolphin swim area and of course the ocean! It's incredibly peaceful and we have left the slider to our balcony open every night to sleep with the crashing wave sounds. Highly recommend this beautiful oasis! ", " This resort is one of the best we've visited! The weather was gorgeous, and locals say it's almost always that way. The resort itself is beautiful, elegant with fabulous views. It has a tram to get from one end of the property to the other quickly, and a boat on the moat for a more leisurely trip. There are a variety of restaurants from casual to fancy, a variety of pools, and nice shops for retail opportunities. There are many activities to keep you busy, both inside and outside; but it was hard for us to leave our balcony that overlooked the dolphin lagoon where training was happening every day. Dolphins are endlessly entertaining! It's a bit pricey, but we will definitely return. ", " Excellent facility and friendly staff. We will definitely return here soon. We booked with a breakfast/dinner inclusive package and used the restaurant facilities extensively during the week. The food and service was excellent. The resort is located on a lagoon and has many pools, pathways and places to enjoy. The tram system and boat feature also added to the experience of this property. ", " Very professional and courteous staff at this Hilton. The housekeeper for our room was Fernan, who did a great job, and left extra shampoo, conditioner, lotion, tissue and toilet paper for us. When I asked to personally thank him, he said he noticed the sofa bed was used, \"so it must be a family on vacation,\" so he took the initiative to leave extras for us. Very thoughtful, humble and friendly man! ", " We had a great experience all around on our 2 night stay! Relaxing day with a fantasy like experience! From the tram ride to our room to the boat ride to get to the lagoon side. Loved walking the shoreline to \"A\" beach also! ", " Stayed for 5 nights & had a great time. It is a large resort but the grounds are so lovely to walk around in, so we walked everywhere instead of catching the train. Only negative is the quality of food being offered at the cafes and restaurants, we tried them all and they were good but maybe need to have some more fresh ideas? Can't wait to come back. ", " We went for lunch. The Cantina is pleasant. Open air, moderately priced, right on the water of the canal. We took the tram to the Cantina, and by the time we finished lunch, the boats had started, at 2pm. We were there at the end of February. We walked around the monumental lobby/entry area, overlooking the lagoon. Just spectacular! My sister-in-law, who travels a lot, says she couldn't think of another place she's been that's as magnificent. Only question remaining: how did Trip Advisor know I'd been there, and invite me to write a review? ", " What a wonderful opportunity to have gone back to the same hotel we honeymooned 20years ago....and the same hotel I proposed at 21.5 yrs ago.The Hilton Waikoloa Village has never disappointed. What a wonderful resort to relax and enjoy one another. Great pool, great rooms, great dinners, relaxing walks, even more relaxing boat rides around the property..Looking forward to celebrating here again and again. ", " If you want a WONDERFUL stay, chose this hotel. Location is wonderful, Pool & Lagoon fabulous, dolphins are awesome to watch, hotel is beautiful & you will have an amazing vacation. Especially Hilton Honor Folks!!! They take care of us... ", " An amazing place for relaxing with great pool and lagoon! The breakfast and the food in the restaurants are a bit expensive but very delicious. Exploring the hotel is an adventure on its own! Don't plan for a lot of extra activities during your stay. Generally, our stay was definitely worth it! :) ", " My wife and I spent 10 days in a one bedroom unit in building 4. It was in beautiful condition and very functional for us to cook an occasional meal. The pools are great and not nearly as crowded as the nearby hotels. The exercise room has a great view and is equipped with the usual assortment of treadmills and ellipticals, but also has free weights and a machine. The buffet breakfast is not worth your time but the bar makes a nice drink. ", " If your looking for a quiet, slow paced vacation, this place is for you. Staff went out of their way to help at any time. I even got texts asking me if I needed anything. I stayed in the ocean tower. Every morning I sat on our balcony and watched the humpbacked whales go by with their babies. How awesome. Pools are great. I especially like the protected lagoon. No matter what the ocean was doing, we had a place to snorkle. There was lots of fish and a couple of sea turtles too. This resort is smack dab in the middle of everything there is to do. We will definitely return to this place. The golf course looked nice also. Didn't get to play but it was well kept. ", " Our stay at the Waikoloa Hilton was the most relaxing and enjoyable trip ever. I really could not find anything that I was dissatisfied with at this Hilton location. Amenities were awesome and we were treated as there number one guest at all times. ", " I stayed at the Kohala Suites. Facing the Golf Course was a serenity experience. The mix of lava and greens gives you the sense of earthy connections. Staff was very accommodating. A shuttle van provided the run-around of the area. For general shopping or food shopping on Village grounds, the van was a thoughtful amenity for no-car guests. It was a relaxing week from the hustle and bustle of the big city. ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for 6 nights in the Ocean Tower. Let me just say before i start, this hotel is HUGE and im not over exaggerating when i say that, it literally has just about everything. They have a full transport system throughout, either a boat or tram which is completely complimentary, this will take you from one end to the other with various stop off points unless you would like to walk as we where in the Ocean Tower, our walk to the main Lobby was about ten minutes, and to the Lagoon about the same. The food on site i will say is a tad expensive, ill outline a few that we visited. KPC (Kamuela Provision Company)This is the \"Surf & Turf\" Restaurant, very good food but you will pay for it. We both had a Starter and main with a bottle or 2 of wine and the bill was well over $200 including tips. Dont get me wrong the steak was beautiful but by god no steak is worth that money.Big Island Breakfast - The breakfast buffet.This is around $32 per person. We didn't eat here so cant comment on whether it is or isnt worth a visit. Personally not worth it in my eyes but depends how much of an eater you are. We took a nice walk to Mai Grill at the Golf club about 15 minutes away they served a lovely breakfast here and with coffee for 2 worked out about $35. Lagoon Grill - Lunch was nice from here overlooking the Dolphins, we only eat here twice but never had a bad snack. We later discovered Lava Lava, a 5 min taxi or 20 minute work down the beach front, definitely worth the walk, the food was amazing, i have done a separate review on this, worth a read and definitely worth a visit. Boat Landing Cantina - Mexican cuisine.Nachos nachos nachos, they are a must, an absolutely massive portion and taste great. We eat here a few times and i must say the food was great. The Burritos and Tacos are certainly worth a try, just one thing be careful if your ordering Vodka, i ordered 3 and when i seen the bill i nearly passed out $15 per shot!! the drinks alone where more expensive that all off the food we ordered lol, stick to Corona Beer $7.Dona & Toni's Pizza - Italian.We had a great meal here overlooking some off the resort and watching the sunset, food was quick and very nice, the garlic break was fantastic. Reasonably priced food and drink, defiantly worth a visit for any pizza lover.The resort is so vast and has a mass variety off activities to suit many. The lagoon has paddle boards, canoes, snorkeling plus loads more, and this place is well worth a visit, as it has a direct feed from the ocean the wildlife is great, we swam with Green Turtles witch was an amazing experience, seen loads off unusual tropical fish, and even had a visit from a Monk seal. so if any off that interests you get yourself down there. They have a Dolphin pool at the hotel as well, we didn't do swimming with them as we have before elsewhere, but you can freely watch them and there amazing talents from the deck near the Lagoon Grill, i think if you wanted to do the swimming its around $250 (at a guess).The roomThe room we had was a resort view, nothing much to view other than Greenland but i don't spend anytime there unless im sleeping so that really isn't an issue for me. The bed and facilities where well up to standard and very comfortable, the TV was a good size and was accompanied by a PlayStation console, this was for the use off the FREE dvd's and PS3 Games that where available to you, and they are quite up to date as well. Bathroom was clean and presentable. Towels and cleaning products where changed daily.The site all though big is well organised, very well maintained and offers some great services, the staff are extremely friendly and are very willing to help in any way, any one visiting in my eyes will not be disappointed. I think i have covered most aspects off the hotel, but feel free to ask any questions if you need them answering. overall a great hotel and a great holiday destination, thanks. ", " I stay at a lot of resorts. I am a hilton diamond member, so I am used to staying in their properties. This resort was awesome.Cons:1. The price of food is crazy. However, that is normal for Hawaii in general, so it wasn't a surprise. 2. Hilton honors members don't get as much here as other properties. However, we got a complimentary upgrade to an oceanside room, and it was awesome. Our views were excellent. Pros: 1. The resort was beautiful--no doubt about it. It is stunning. In fact, it is so vast it can be a pain to get around. However, you are on vacation, so what's the rush?!2. The lagoon was beautiful and our checkin agent told us to go to the top of the waterfall to see sea turtles easily. We did and it was so cool. 3. The dolphins so close were also very cool. I would go back in a heartbeat. It was an excellent trip and it is hard to come up with things we didn't like! ", " Spent a week here in Jan 2016 with 4 kids. Adjoining rooms worked well, kids had a blast with pool, Dolphins, turtles, lagoon, snorkelling, etc. There is a great beach about 15 min north - Hapuna Beach, definitely worth a day trip. You can rent boogie boards at the beach. Lots of other stuff to do on the island. Kids really wanted to swim with dolphins, at the hotel it would have cost over $1000 for all of us for 20 min. Instead we went on a 5 hr swim with wild Dolphins adventure in the ocean, cost was $650. Zip lining, volcano park, snorkelling, etc. Probably a good idea to rent a car. This hotel is an awesome place to call 'home' after a day on the island. ", " The resort is very elegant and well maintained. The rooms are clean and spacious and the housekeeping service is prompt and efficient. The food on the premises though is very costly and the parking fees are exorbitant. Luckily, there is a food court about a mile drive from the place. ", " Strikingly beautiful property. So large you may need to take a monorail to your hotel room. But try not to....the grounds are SO nicely designed and decorated, you don't want to miss it! Statues. Trails. Foliage. Fabulous landscaping. Wonderful just to wander. Man made beach is calm. Restaurants good; I especially enjoyed the Big Island Breakfast. Bountiful buffet! My only two complaints included the room. Having just stayed at Grand Wailea with renovated rooms, I was disappointed. The room was mediocre. Not bad. Just banal. In any event, my other complaint relates to the use of the property as time share. I loved the grounds so much, I wanted to take the tour. The Hilton offers some Hilton points if you do this, but my spouse wasn't with me, and the activities office refused to let me do this by myself! Their loss. But overall: a nice stay at an attractive property. I look forward to staying there again.  ", " Huge. But you have your own ocean lagoon to safely snorkel and play in. You have a train and a boat to ride to your room in. You have long walks between everything so no need to ho to a gym. They have captive dolphins that seem happy to play with you and each other. Long pools with waterfalls and slides. Can't think of a better place to bring children or grandchildren. Starts at $250 for a room plus $30 resort fee plus $30 a day valet parking. (Yes you'll want this. Parking is acres away. ). Plus 13% tax. Plus $17 tacos. So budget 350 and up a day. And if this doesn't bother you you'll have a great time and so will your kids. Did i mention turtles to swim with in the lagoon? Monumental Asian art everywhere. A train shuttle. A boat shuttle. Its only money! ", " We had a great time at this Hilton. This is our 5th visit here and will be back again. The people at the hotel are friendly and helpful. The resort is big enough that you don't need to leave it - but you should to explore the island. There are several good restaurants on site, with more close by at the 2 nearby shopping malls. ", " You won't be disappointment , huge resort with wonderful rooms , shower gels , soaps , clean with beautiful views , lots of beautiful walkways even a river boat service , food is delicious in the many onsite restaurants, check out the luau very entertaining if not a little expensive for what you actually get, book book book . ", " This hotel has great, friendly, hardworking, loyal employees. They keep us coming back year after year. The employees have kept us coming back for the past 15 years because of their ohana.My only complaint, or suggestion, is to address the transportation to and from the lobby. At one time it took no more than 5 to 10 minutes to reach any hotel room, in any building, when the boats and trams ran more efficiently. It now can take up to a half hour or more to make it from the lobby to your room. This makes traveling to the beach or golf course extremely time consuming. I understand that at one time, cutting back on the transportation, may have been financially necessary. The majority of people who stay at the resort are there to experience the tram and the boats. I would gladly pay an additional resort fee, or higher resort fee, just to move about the resort more efficiently. I propose the hotel place the boats back into operation, charge an additional fee to cover the costs, and reserve most of the boats for hotel guests. Access can be controlled with either the pool bands or room keys. The resort fee could be an additional daily fee or weekly fee. I would certainly insist any large corporate meeting pay the fee to maximize efficiency and your profit. This can be a win win situation for the guests and hotel itself. The guests will pay for the privilege to ride the boats and the hotel can make a profit. ", " Delightful resort with many many things to do, see, places to eat Etc. Always clean, friendly and orderly. Convienant tram and boat tender services to have ease of access throughout the resort. Sheltered saltwater cove great for snorkeling, and safe for children too. Dolphin experience. So many choices. ", " Very happy with this resort. We stayed here as a couple but will definitely bring the kids back. Everything that you need and want is in this resort. The staff were amazing and the rooms in the Maki tower were nice and clean. We had room 6329 which had a nice view of the ocean, sunset and dolphins. It was a great room, we love this resort and will be back for sure. ", " Unforgettable facilities and views. You won't be disappointed. Worth every penny. Walk the grounds, the beach , stop and watch the dolphins, go to a luau, ride the tram, read the history along the hallways. There is no other place quite like it. ENJOY! ", " Having grown up on the Big Island, I used to come to this resort as a child. Returning as an adult it was just as flamboyant as I remembered. Where else can you take a boat or a train - the only one on the island - just to grab a coffee? I've no doubt the Hilton is not to everybody's tastes (please don't go expecting a luxury, boutique experience!) but if you pack a sense of humour & suspend your disbelief (yes, there really are dolphins) you will have a brilliant time. Maybe take out a loan before you arrive, too. The restaurant prices are eye-watering, if you eat in the resort. ", " This is a dream property for a family vacation (kids) and for grownups. So big you need to use the tram or boats to move from one side of the property to another. Every where you look you are surrounded by beauty. Its my daughters favorite place. ", " The front desk check in process was expeditious with the help of Ed. He checked us in quickly with a great sense of humor. Then Emily at the Concierge desk went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience while at the resort. The location is beautiful especially at KPC Restaurant watching the sunset, listening to the waves and seeing the whales!!! ", " The Hilton experience is a live and well at the Waikola Village. If you have an idea of the Hilton experience you won't be disappointed at the Waikola Village. It is a big complex full of amenities and lots to do, only limited by your time and energy. The rooms were clean and well appointed.The grounds were spotless and well manicured. The pool area and all other wetland areas were well maintained. As with most Hilton's be sure to bring your wallet and be prepared to pay for your pay for your experience. It should be noted that there are two shopping areas with restaurants for those on a budget and desiring choices that the Hilton doesn't.The staff is great and takes good care of their customers. They create a great experience for everyone. ", " Great value and unbelievable grounds group. The place is always beautiful. Never saw a single scrap of trash the entire time and the hotel staff was very customer focused and engaged. I would recommend to anyone who is visiting the Big Island to book your stay here. ", " It was awesome, for our first family valentine's day staycation... it was great and my kids had a blast .. the weather was beautiful, they gave us a free fold up bed since the room we had had 2 Queens but we wanted a king and sofa bed .. the pools and slides were perfect for the kids and they loved riding on the tram and boat ", " My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this resort. The grounds werespectacular with art work placed thru out the property. What impressed us most was the hotel staff always smiling and your ever need is taken care of.The trams ran on time so did the boat. Sunset dinner at Kamuela Provision Cowas well worth the price. One of our top five trips. ", " This was a great resort for the whole family!Recommend that you rent a car for at least a day or 2 so you can get out of the resort as it is a bit remote so eating every meal there can get expensive. We stayed in the Makai which had great views over the lagoon and ocean and the whole place was just magical! ", " Stayed here for a week when I had convention to attend to. The place is amazingly huge that you could use a tram or a boat to get from one side to the other. Their convention area was pretty good also. Enjoyed using the pool at night since their pools were open until 10pm (could be later) and you practically have the place almost to yourself. The water was a little cold especially at night but felt good after moving around. If you decide to stay here I would make sure to spend a lot of time in the property to take advantage of the price you pay for the room. I can't comment about the restaurants since we made it a point to go explore the island and dine before coming back. ", " This hotel is actually a fabulous resort, including a small lake and canal and multiple swimming pools and SPAs, several guest towers, golf grounds, restaurants, a conference center, a whole South-Asian museum of paitnings and sculptures and memorabilia, and much more! To move amongst the sites one really needs the monorail (!) and boat (!!) provided by the hotel ", " We have come annually for the last 25 years to celebrate our anniversary. We have been here 5 days so far, and will be here another week. The hotel, staff, grounds, and rooms are excellent, no complaints there. The restaurants though are another story. First we ordered a pizza from Dona and tony's a couple days ago, using the tv in the room for a room service delivery. We got exactly one 18\" pizza, and one bottle of beer delivered. The bill was $70!!! Now normally I wouldn't mentioned this, but only do because the prices listed on the in room tv menu DO NOT MATCH what the restaurant charges. You no longer have a room service book in the room, but have to look up items on your tv. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but when the tv prices DO NOT MATCH what the charges are, you end up like we did with a $70 pizza. Then last night we went for our annual anniversary dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company KPC. The view can't be beat, but be cautioned on how in our opinion the restaurant has changed over the past years. Of course there is the normal price increase, but not a problem since you don't go there expecting a big mac. However my wife and I each got different dinners. My wife started with a shrimp cocktail, in past years she received either 4 or 5 very large shrimp. This year she received 3! My wife also had just ordered a lemonaid with her dinner. The drink was fine but was mostly ice. The waiter later came by and asked if she'd like another one, to which she repled yes. ONLY WHEN WE OBTAINED THE BILL DID WE KNOW THERE IS AN ADDITONAL $4.00 CHARGE FOR THE 2ND ICE FILLED GLASS!!! Her chicken dinner was of a very small portion and not more then one table spoon of potato. Very skimpy! I had the steak which in itself was excellent, but the potato side frits could be used to drive nails in. We were both amazed on how small the portions have become. We both finished with a great desert. What's ironic is after we settled the bill ($200), the couple at the next table was offered a 'free desert' for there anniversary!!!! The restaurant knew we were there for our 25th anniversary as I had mentioned it in our reservation and we were congratulated on arrival. To top it off, I ended up chipping a tooth on a chocolate nut shell in my desert! All and all we have been VERY disappointed in the restaurants so far. In our last up coming week we'll probably eat off site. Again the hotel and grounds can't be beat, but based on 25 years of experience there is a marked difference in the restaurant offerings. Between being charged $25.00 to guarantee an outdoor table, $4.00 EACH for ice filled pop or lemonaid, and skimpy portions, $70 pizza's with wrong prices... well all I can say is stay here, but DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!! SO SO DISAPOINTED IN HOW THE QUALITY HAS DEMINISHED OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS.... ", " Great hotel with very good facilities and service. We have enjoyed the stay very much and can recommend it to anyone. Weather was good as well, in a fantastic environment. For our son of 9 all required facilities are there as well and not too loud or lots of children noise. ", " Wow, what a great family getaway! The pools are wonderful and we all enjoyed the water slides. There is so much to do there, it's incredible. The staff are amazing, always have a smile and an aloha for for you. Our room was very spacious and had an ocean view. I loved hearing all the birds in the morning - what a treat. I can't say enough what a fabulous experience this resort is. We'll be back this year! ", " We upgraded to a premium room and it was so worth it. The hotel is very near the ocean and with our patio door open we listened to the surf all night. The room was a good stone's throw away from the water and on that side of the hotel (Ocean Tower facing southwest) we got both morning and evening sun. It is a very long walk from the main lobby to the Ocean tower (literally a ten minute walk) but there is a monorail if you don't want to walk it. There are also boats that take you to and from various towers but they were rarely running--not sure what their schedule is. The restaurants and pool area were very nice and the hotel was everything it was advertised to be. ", " There is a reason why this resort is rated top 10 of US resorts. Our stay was even more than we imagined it would be. Where it really excelled was in the food offered as part of our all-inclusive package. We had 7 breakfasts and 7 dinners. We ate at the Japanese restaurant three times, and the KPC twice, Luau once and the pizza restaurant once. I would rate all the meals a 10. Even my husband who is not a sit around the pool type of guy, enjoyed lots of pool time. Everywhere we walked around the resort, due to the huge investment in artifacts and art work, it was like walking through a museum constantly. When not in a building, God's creation provided scenes pleasing to the eyes every direction you looked. The setting of this hotel is absolutely fabulous. Definitely expecting to return. We felt it was a good value for our travel dollars. Pretty much felt like this was about our best vacation in 42 years of marriage. ", " IF there was a downside to this hotel it would be the distance from lobby to some of the rooms. Of course you have many options to make the trek. Food was delicious at most of the restaurants. The lagoon is an excellent way to enjoy some snorkeling and spend some time with the sea turtles without having to jump in the ocean. Love the dolphins which you are able to swim with. It is close to town if you want a Walmart or just to do some shopping. Of all the islands this is so diverse. You can go for a drive and find some snow in the mountains or hike up to the live lava flow. Beautiful waterfalls and recomend the helicopter flight for waterfalls and volcano. Hilton also has a great luau. A must do!! You will truly enjoy your stay at this beautiful spot!! ", " Well where to start? There are so many positives to say about this beautiful hotel. Perfect for a family holiday or a romantic escape. Located right by the sea, the setting is quite amazing. If you visit at the right time of year, expect to see a few blue whales jumping out from time to time to say hello. The sheer size of the hotel must make it one of the biggest around and you are able to get around either by foot, boat or monorail!! The activities for both kids and adults makes sure that you are kept busy, and the vast number of pools ensures that there is plenty of space to catch those Ray's of sun. Plenty of dining outlets to choose from each evening keeps you excited as to what to experience next. A fresh water lagoon allows for some extraordinary sea life creatures to get up close with. This hotel has to be high up on anyone's list! ", " We enjoyed lunch in an open air cafe overlooking the dolphin pool. The menu, while limited, was appropriate for the location and the time of day. The quality of food was good and the service enjoyable. The dolphin show added to the enjoyment of our experience. ", " If you want to be treated like a king or queen, you must go to Hilton Waikoloa Village. From check in to check out the team was top notch! Enjoyed the friendly texts asking me how my stay is going. Great part of the hotel is the options. If you want to stay on property there are a sea of choices; from delicious food to a personal lagoon. If you want to explore the Big Island is just as diverse. For me it was nice to drive to Waimea home of Parker Ranch! ", " Great customer service began as soon as we drove up to the friendly and helpful valet service. It continued into the registration desk where the concierge \"Janice\" welcomed us over and began to check us in. Earlier, I elected for the e-upgrade option and my family was surprised and elated with the Palace Tower suite. Through our conversation with Ms. Janice she was able to schedule a teppanyaki dinner at the Imari restaurant to help celebrate my son's birthday. All throughout our stay the staff made this the best memorable visit for a kama'aina family. ", " While waiting to check in,an elixer of at least 4 combined juices is offered.The lobby is a most welcomed site.An expansive front desk area,with a beautiful Dolphin sculpture near the boat ,or train that takes you to your room.So many amenities here.A wonderful Spa,at least three pools.A lagoon,and A seated Buddha atop a hill surveys the land.Will come back ,and so pleased .All the restaurants are wonderful.Love the fact one gets to them by boat !Will always be happy here ", " This resort exceeded my expectations. The grounds were incredible with lounge chairs along the beach. I even got to see turtles and dolphins during my stay. You can find peace & serenity as well has fun and excitement! ", " Great experience. All inclusive resort. Many things available to enjoy. Relaxation, water sports, snorkeling. Great restaurants and boutique shops. My wife and I enjoyed a lot all the wonderful pools, and snorkeling in the lagoon that is directly connected to the ocean. There are also several shops and good restaurants close to the resort. All these within walking distance. ", " I travelled here with my parents, aunt and uncle and boyfriend in December 2015. We had stayed in the Palace tower, which when we had arrived was still in renovations. Our room was beautiful and the view was gorgeous. There was so much to do from the big pool with the waterfalls to the lagoon and so much more. I thought it was really great that you had different options to get to places through the resort, either by tram, boat or just simply walking. I would definitely come back here again! ", " This hotel is a paradise in the middle of lava rock fields. The rooms are very clean and nice. The staff is very helpful. The only downside at all if the distance from the parking lot to the lobby. I wish there had been a shuttle to the parking lot. Other than that, everything was perfect. We stayed in the Ocean tower, the view was amazing. ", " We had a room in the Palace Tower and it was great! The food was great at Dona and Tony's and at the pool bar. We loved the tram and boat too. Also had lots of help from most of the concierges. Aloha. And Mahalo!! ", " The is hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and I have stayed in some nice hotels (Waldorf Astoria, Ritz Carlton etc.) It is extremely spacious, with wonderful ponds and pools. There is always something to do here, and a new place to explore. The luau at the hotel is also fantastic! ", " We had such a great time, lots to do. We went to a couple different bars which had friendly servers and good food. We also went to the Italian restaurant for some pasta, it was really good, big portions we could have easily shared. Whale watched everyday while sitting on the outside of the pool area facing the ocean. Our room was amazing, it looked over the Dolphin pool straight to the ocean. One particular staff member was very helpful when we wanted to change rooms, feel bad I can't remember her name. Planned some trips to different parts of the Island but wished we would have spent more time at the Resort. Sad we didn't stay longer. ", " The people were all helpful and friendly. Everyone here was trying to help the tourists to have a great vacation and it worked!This was the view outside of our room...was beautiful and the weather could not have been better. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great vacation! ", " My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our trip to Hawaii, and were impressed. No complaints on anything. Everything was as good as we had hoped or better. Despite the near-5000-mile journey, we are looking for ways to return with our kids for a stay in the next few months. The coffee-shop was the only thing that could have been improved, but that's pretty picky, and I'm a coffee-snob, so YMMV. ", " The Waikoloa Village was a perfect end to a three week vacation in Hawaii. It was finally time to stop all of the wild activities and chill out. The strategically located hot tubs, some in the shade and some in the sun, where a perfect complement to the cool pool and waterfalls. The swim up bar provided ice water as an option to the drinks for free.There were some issues with our booking but Shawn at the front desk was amazing and straightened it all out for us.I would do this again in a heartbeat! ", " My other half and I came to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii to volunteer for the yearly whale count for NOAA. We had a chance to stay at the beautiful Hilton Waikoloa. CONS Price: The price of what we paid was a little higher than we expected. Food: We ordered room service on our first night and paid $60 for dried out steak and small pieces of food. We had to cut it into tiny pieces to fill our stomachs. Spa: We enjoyed the massage at the Spa, but had no area to relax in. All the lounge chairs were all filled, and there was no privacy or other place to sit down and enjoy the amenities so we left after paying almost $350 to enjoy the facility. PROS Text Concierge: I love love love this service! They were so helpful in helping me make dinner reservations, pulling my car out of valet, and calling security for us when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the room! Awesome and good job! Kamuela Provision Company: We enjoyed this restaurant on our last evening there. They gave us a special treat for celebrating our anniversary dinner there. (I was a little weary sitting outside, as gorgeous as the sunset was, because The Big Island has mosquitoes carrying dengue.) No bites here so I am all good! We plan on visiting the resort again once we\u2019ve saved up enough. We really wanted to check out Inari Restaurant (they were closed all weekend), kayaking in the lagoon, and swimming with the dolphins for our next visit. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the resort. Thank you! ", " A fantastic resort with friendly staff that are very helpful. The resort is very spacious but you can get around by boat or train which makes it very easy. The lagoon is beautiful with plentiful fish and the occasional turtle. We did the Dolphin Quest experience and that was also very good. The breakfast is really nice and the restaurant has a great view of the lagoon. A well maintained property with beautiful lawns and gardens. I highly recommend this resort. ", " It's a huge property. We stayed at the newly renovated wing (the one with dolphin pool and closest to the reception). As a Hilton Diamond I was upgraded to a suite but with zero view. Property itself has tons to do, they have their own small lagoon where you can rent Kayaks, snorkeling gear and such. We ate at the asian restaurant one night, service was great but food was just bland...... ", " This place is a slice of paradise on earth, because of (not despite) the issues mentioned by other reviewers.Yes, there are birds. Some chirp in the morning. You're on a tropical lagoon filled with fish. Birds eat fish and chirp with happiness. If this sounds like a problem to you, don't go to Hawaii.Yes, the property is large. So large, there are at least 3 different ways to get from one side to the other: boat, tram, and feet. I recommend the latter, since the property also has countless amazing pieces of art placed tastefully about the walkways.Yes, breakfast is expensive. Or so I've heard. I never ate at the $30 breakfast place. Instead I went down to the cafe near my room, and ate a modest meal while watching the fish swim around.Don't go here if you're: in a rush or have mobility problems (or traveling with those who do)Do go here if you're: willing to take things slow for a few days and forget about the rest of the world. ", " In our opinion, this is the best resort in the area and the best resort we've ever stayed at for vacation. My husband and I have discussed; this is the only place we'll stay when returning to the big island. We visited other hotels, but they were not as nice. ", " My first trip to the Big Island from Maui, everyone said you need to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa!!! They were right, this place did not disappoint. Service was top notch, accommodations were second to none.....you could literally never leave the property and never run out of things to do, this place has it all. ", " We read a lot of Trip Advisor reviews before booking a room in the Lagoon Tower with Makai. At first we booked a Mountain View but a week before going I had misgivings...why would I book a room to look at the \"mountains\" in Hawaii when the resort is on the ocean? I called and spoke with someone (truly wish I wrote down her name because she was brilliant and would earn a pin also) who helped up move to the 6th floor on the ocean side. WOW!!!! We took the tram to our tower at night and marveled at the waterways and the bustle of the hotel. We tumbled into a very comfortable bed in a very clean, up to date room. In the morning we were awed when we threw back the curtains and sat on our lanai for breakfast overlooking the dolphins, the ocean, and some of the pool. We had a good view of the large dolphin pool and regularly saw the dolphins playing and jumping through the air with no trainers around. We enjoyed the boat rides to and from our room even though there was absolutely no need for us to take transportation to/from our tower; the walk was just a few minutes, through an outside shopping area. Also, it gave us time to quiz our knowledgeable Makai concierge staff about local highlights and ideas for fun things to do. On to the pin: we tried paddle boarding which was a challenge for one of us...no names or fingers pointed...but John at the Ocean Sports desk was a dream. He was filled with unending patience and kindness toward the one of us who struggled to balance. After many tries, we finally found success! John was encouraging, positive, and charismatic. He was confident without being arrogant. We travel a lot and have been impressed frequently but never absolutely \"wow\"ed. Perhaps I'm hard to please and stingy with my Trip Advisor pins but, we found him to be the best service person we have encountered. Thus, I doled out my first Trip Advisor pin!!! ", " Beautiful grounds, pounding surf. Try to schedule a dolphin program if you can; a wonderful experience. I loved the coffee shops and the big pools. The room was quite comfortable and the service was superior in every way. I highly recommend this hotel and this location. ", " This is a resort that anyone would enjoy. Located on the beach not far from the airport and easily reached . Food is good and service is great. The island is beautiful and the staff will acquaint you with many lovely things to go and see or do. ", " I arrived a day earlier than my reservation for a business conference and had no idea how I made that mistake! However, Frank at the front desk did not blink an eye and adjusted my reservation which I appreciated and kept my anxiety levels low. I did note immediately that my \"Delux ocean view\" room really did not view the ocean (room #2302). Frank really did not seem to think he could fix that and made a note for staff the next day. Staff the next day did work with me and moved me to room #6324 which was amazing!!This helpful change of room improved my experience so much! I could see and hear waves from anywhere in the room. So relaxing. Watched whales from my Lanai. Sliding glass door opens more than half way across room. The next best part of this resort was the ocean-fed lagoon. It is a man-made extention of the ocean into the property in a serpentine shape. Well planned nooks and protected spaces for marine life. Then they welcome snorkeling and rent equipment cheap ($10/hr or $18/half-day). Hands down the best snorkeling I've ever done and better than many scuba dives!! They offer \"Snuba\" as well and I didn't try this and can not comment on that. Too many species to list, but highlights were many sea turtles, conefish, needle fish, spotted box fish, tons of tropical fish, and little lobster-like creatures hiding in porous rocks too! Much of this wild life can be seen without snorkeling, simply walk the perimeter of the lagoon at a time that there is good sunlight into the Lagoon. Trails are very well planned and landscaped.There are captive dolfins here, I count 5 in what appears to be a somewhat small area for them, but they appear well cared for and happy. I enjoyed watching them but if you are opposed to this please be forewarned.There are more pools than I even wanted to count or visit. I only swam in the lagoon and pool close to the Lagoon Tower and was amazed by both.There is walking but just enough to feel like I can get some exercise without walking in circles. Lots of fun areas of property to investigate with a Chapel, bridges, trails, pools, ocean-side seating, sunset sights, multiple restaurants and bars, etc. However, if you are frail or have difficulty getting around it could be daunting. Service was very good for my week long stay. I did not find service to be person-independent but routinely had great service, efficiency, good communication, and no show of frustration. I realize that is not easy and I greatly appreciate their efforts. Mahalo! ", " Everything is on a huge scale here, including your budget if you aren't careful. There's a really good coffee outlet at the Ocean View suites, and the lagoon is not short of marine creatures to see when snorkelling; the landscaping is one of the nicest features, just admiring the sea, coconut trees, grass and really good sunsets is a visual treat. There's a Kings and Queens shopping area just a short $2.00 shuttle ride away, the supermarket there was full of Hilton guests saving money on food and drinks; a good plan unless money is no object. The Mayo Clinic was holding a convention here when we stayed, I took this to be a good sign. But the hotel complex is a long drive from the volcanic areas if this is why you have come to the big island. However the standard of service is very high, as one would expect from a Hilton, and if you just wanted to relax and not stray far from the complex it would be ideal. ", " We had a lovely time away from home, staying at the Hilton Waikoloa! Although we live on the Island we love to take family trips to the Hilton. The staff is always friendly, they offer kamaaina discounts and there is always tons of activities for our children. There is no hotel like it on the island. ", " Beautiful hotel. It is very large so you will walk a lot. Lots to do. Great place for kids. Shopping center within walking distance or there is a shuttle available. Would recommend. However, we recently attended a large convention there and the WiFi was TERRIBLE. It was extremely sporadic or not available at all. We were frequently disconnected or not able to connect at all. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the facilities and would stay there again. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is such a cool experience. From the moment you step out of your car and you are greeted by the valet, you can't help but feel like you are on Fantasy Island. The grounds of this hotel are unbelievable. The big surprise is the boat ride you take to your room. Wasn't expecting that and gotta say, Loved it! The amazing statues just make you find your inner zen and if you stroll the property there are treasures around every corner. For those who want a Dolphin encounter you can interact with them for a fee or if you choose, something truly unforgettable, walk out to the shore and relax with a glass of wine watching the whales as they charge out of the water. They are so close you can hear them and it's really captivating to watch them jump up and slowly dive down as they wave their tail good bye. It was really hard to leave this magical place! ", " My husband and I were here for a conference. We absolutely loved it and plan to return. The pools are perfect all with a gorgeous view. As is the lagoon, we rented a kayak for a half hour and paddled around a little to see the fish and turtles swimming. All of the restaurants were delicious. The pork nachos at the Cantina are a must try. The only downfall is the beach but it's a short walk or ride down to the beach at the Mariott. The resort is large but that wasn't a problem for us as the walk to and from along the beach is very nice. ", " Gorgeous views, lots of places to eat, multiple pools, tram, boat and lagoon. Beach access and amazing staff make this a great place to stay. There are several towers each w their own amenities. Adult only pool and shopping onsite. Walking distance and shuttles to kings and queens shops. ", " Great place to stay, especially with children. They have wonderful pools with activities for children. However, they don't have ocean beaches. There are several great beaches nearby, however, you would be better with your own rental cars. The hotel / resort is not far away from airport and very easy to get there. ", " Gorgeous hotel with lots of amenities, some shopping, excellent beaches, and there is a bay right at the hotel that is very calm hidden from the surf. there are fish and sea turtles that swim in this bay. They also have dolphins and shark that are there for observation. There is a boat and train that runs the full length of e hotel for those with tired feet. Very peaceful and laid back island.A few other things that are a must see are the observation site at the top of the mountain, the active volcano (I forget the name if it) and a coffee plantation such as Kona Joes. ", " The resort is always fun. We live the private Lagoon. Rooms are ok. Food is expensive. So we bought into the Hilton timeshare about 8 years ago and we love it. Less expensive too. We enjoy cooking our food. ", " Liane kicks it! This is the tennis pro you always hope to find; energetic, skilled, patient, and -- above all -- with a great sense of humor. I learned more from her than I have in years and enjoyed every minute, even when she was running me ragged. Her clinics pull together a wide range of skills and leave everyone smiling. If you want tennis, she's the one to see. ", " This is large hotel spread over a substantial area. There is a train (that runs from 6AM until midnight) and a boat (from 2PM until 10PM) to make transportation easy, but walking is very pleasant indeed along a pathway with a huge art collection. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, with everything necessary. There are lots of pools and the hotel has its own luau ground. There is also a flamingo collection, a parakeet collection, a dolphin pool and other things to amuse oneself with. This is a fascinating place, aptly nicknamed the Disney World of the Big Island, but it is for the most part not cheesy at all, but quite nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for families with children. ", " I went there with my mother for a seven day stay for christmas. The hotel is located in an area of the island that is usually very sunny and warm during the day. The hotel itself is designed as a fantasy getaway and is a perfect place to stay if you want time off from the world. They have a variety of activities, including Dolphin Quest (book in advance to be certain that they can accommodate you), as well as the saltwater bay that one can snorkel in to explore the many fishes, and sometimes sea turtles, that live there. ", " We had a fabulous time swimming with the dolphins on our recent trip to the Hilton. We were a little skeptical at first, because we didn't know what the conditions were like, and it seemed like keeping these animals in captivity was cruel. We asked A LOT of questions, and were actually genuinely impressed with the staff at the Dolphin Encounters. They knew their stuff, and were very gracious. By the end I was truly convinced that these animals lived a happy and healthy life. ", " I was actually staying down the beach at the Marriott with my boyfriend for my birthday & New Years. I tried to book the Marriott spa on my birthday, they couldn't fit me in, the Hilton spa could, but I decided to wait until New Years day to get in at my own hotel on our last day on the island. So, I booked Marriott spa & they called me a half an hour before my appointment & cancelled it!!! I was in tears, I really base my holiday being complete by having a massage. This was terrible news, but when I called the Hilton spa telling them what happened, they did everything they could to get me in before my flight left & I had a wonderful experience at the spa. It wasn't crowded, it was peaceful, I really love the hot tub outside, lemon infused spa water, steam room, private showers & lovely staff. They really made me feel special & David gave an excellent massage. My aesthetician was a sweet bubbly blonde woman I think named Kay who also was wonderful! I can't thank you guys enough for completing my holiday & fitting me in... ", " We really loved our stay at this resort. We had a spacious, ocean-side Makai room. The staff was wonderful, the views incredible and the amenities very nice. The pools were lovely and there were many places to watch the sun set over the ocean. We loved the SUP yoga class on the lagoon!We had a slight issue when we first arrived, for whatever reason housekeeping hadn't finished the room prior to our check in. However, when we made the front desk aware of this, we were super impressed with their response. This is a place we will keep in mind for future vacations. ", " Outstanding Combination business and sightseeing Base, on Big Island.We were able to visit the classic local sites on the Big Island, from Konato Hilo, round trip North, using this Hotel as our base. ( Hey, Hilo Doors-Off\" Copter Ride into Volcano...Priceless ! )This Hotel Venue is tops in all Hawaii for any type of meeting. No Waikiki bar scenery, Yet those available... are most Relaxing ! ... After your daily busy Schedule may wear.This Resort, with our Makai room overlooking the Dolphin Quest, Made Our Visit.......magical. Best Recommendations:1. AUTOMOBILE !!!! rent one stat at Airport no matter length of your stay. Jeepers-peltz.... Cab =. $ 88.00 one way to hotel for 2 . With tip. Forgot THIS Recommendation ? Best rate for cars are back at the airport ! ($88.00 cab return)2. LENGTH OF STAY....must stay minimum 5 NIGHTS. Travel shall Indeed waste Day 1 and Last Day of your stay. ", " Wanted to spend some time in a serene environment and this place fit the bill! Totally in an out of the way spot on the Big Island. If you are searching for peace and quiet and you want to be at a resort and have every possible thing you could imagine at your finger tips then book your trip to this spot now! You will not have to do a thing, you will not have to go anywhere, you will be able to totally relax and enjoy your peace and quiet. I actually went here to study for an exam that was giving me a lot of stress and lets just say I passed the exam with flying colors! If you can swing it, just come. Relax and enjoy the amazing food, the comfortable bed, the nice patio off of your room, the walk to the beach with hardly any people on it. Just come and relax. ", " Stayed at Hilton Waikoloa for 3 days. The resort is HUGE, with a number of different buildings, pools, restaurants and a lagoon within the grounds. There is a tram and a boat to assist guests getting around, or walking is easy. Stayed in the Lagoon tower. Room was listed as \"mountain view\", however we had both mountain and ocean views from our balcony. We were \"makai\" guests - this is worth the small extra price to get the benefits. Overall we enjoyed our short time here and would recommend the property to others. ", " I consider myself a well experienced traveler. I am an elite member of most hotel programs and have to say that our recent stay in Kona at the Hilton Waikoloa Village was outstanding from start to finish. In addition to having a well seasoned executive team and management, the housekeeping, food and beverage and activities teams were stellar. The fact that I happened to meet two island locals, including a firefighter who frequently brought his kids there because it was the most from the kids friendly resort on the island, speaks volumes . This is definitely a kid friendly resort with lots of onsite activities. The view from our recently renovated Palace Tower room was beyond stellar; we were treated every night to the most amazing sunsets. To summarize, this is a very well-maintained sprawling property with both a tram and boats to get you from one end of the property to the other. My personal favorite is the most northern point of the property, the picturesque view by the Buddah. Considering myself a hotel and leisure expert I would strongly recommend this property when traveling to Kona with your family, this property will make all of your vacation dreams come true. ", " This is our 3rd time here. This time we used points and both rooms were upgraded to the Makai rooms in the palace tower. I loved our room 7276. I amazed on how a hotel that is over 20 years old can transform its rooms to a modern look. Great a/c and flat screen tele. The bed was very comfortable. The facilities are fantastic. Although it would be great to have hot tubs near the ocean tower pool. We loved the lagoon with the variety of fish. Restraunts were great, epically the Italian place. Delicious pizza. Breakfast was good although the last day I did the full breakfast and the waffles were cold, the butter didn't melt at all. We went to the luau and it was fantastic. Food was great and I haven't had such great pork before. It was so succulent and juicy and the show was great. There is a shuttle from the hotel that $2 each way to the queens shops that I swear has the smallest Macy's in America. ", " This hotel is perfectly located in a beautiful place. It has all the amenities and activities you could possibly want for a great family vacation or a romantic get-away. The restaurants are top quality, and you don't have to leave the hotel property for anything, from fine dining to dolphin encounters to whale watching. ", " Bottom line first: The Waikaloa Village was better than we were expecting. The hotel itself did not disappoint and we enjoyed our stay there very much. The rooms were clean, the service was good and parking was easily accessible (needed key to access parking, so it was secure). The hotel has a large, clean pool area, a swimming lagoon with many water activities offered as well as a large beach area, and a 'dolphin quest' activity. There are lots of outdoor areas to hang out, have a drink, grab a coffee, or get a bite. All on a huge property with extensive walking paths and places to explore. As with all of the resorts we have stayed at on Hawaii, the grounds were meticulously well maintainedInside, the hotel has many shops, walking areas, and a meandering moat with boat service to take you to different areas of the hotel. This is handy since the property is quite spread out (the boats run on a track similar to Disney's Jungle Cruise). There are also some staffed kiosks to book various activities and excursions. While we didn't take advantage of these services, the staff seemed very friendly and eager to help. Our one meal at the hotel was a breakfast brunch in the main dining area. While it was typical brunch fare, the food was quite good.In addition to the hotel amenities, there was a lot to do in close proximity to the hotel. For example, there are the King's Shops and Queen's Marketplace shopping/dining plazas. If your plan was to take one of the helicopter tours of the island, Blue Hawaiian Helicopter tours has a helipad about 10 minutes away from the hotel right on Rt 19/Queen Ka'ahumanu hwy (Blue Hawaiian is excellent by the way). Also close by, we chose the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Sunset Luau as our Luau spot for this trip. The Marriott is the next hotel over from the Hilton so it's easy to get to walking or driving. The Sunset Luau received a pretty good rating and we did enjoy it.We are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members and could have stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacations Kohala Suites which is in close proximity to the hotel. We elected use Hilton Honors points to stay at the hotel instead of the HGVC Kohala Suites because the hotel itself is right on the water while the Kohala Suites were not really near the water (or much else). You can get a sense of what I'm referring to by checking out the property on Google Maps (satellite view). We've enjoyed all the HGVC reports we've stayed at and I'm sure the Kohala Suites are equally great. But we preferred the hotel over the HGVC resort in this case. Hope this helps! ", " The resort was so relaxing and had plenty of activities within a short walk/shuttle ride. The property here is huge and effectively contains 3 different hotel facilities. We spent the last two nights of our Hawaii vacation here and enjoyed snorkeling in the lagoon, watching the dolphins, relaxing around the resort, and just getting that last bit of relaxation before the long flight home. It is a bit on the pricey side, but I would have been happy to stay a few more nights. ", " Whether you are a couple looking for a romantic holiday, or a family wanting a fun place to visit, the Hilton Waikoloa has all bases covered. The main pool is filled with playful noise and activities and the various hot tubs and waterfalls give the kids plenty of fun in the water. The lagoon on the other hand provides an opportunity to relax and the cabanas available for rent, allow you to create your own little slice of paradise. The food & beverage options are first class and nothing beats dining at the KPC and watching the sun set over the pacific. ", " This resort is monstrous. It's a 15-minute brisk walk just to get from the main lobby to some of the rooms. Having said that, it's very beautiful. Each hallway is filled with lovely Asian art and historical pieces; the place is like an art gallery / museum in many ways. And the ocean views are just magnificent. There are multiple pools and lagoons with water slides, beach toys for borrow, snorkeling opportunities, and even kayaks. There's also numerous putting greens and a nice golf course. It's great fun. A few minor negatives: (1) The food on the resort is incredibly, almost unreasonably, expensive. Be prepared to spend huge amounts for meals. (2) Don't waste your money at the Cantina Mexican restaurant. Overpriced and not very good. (3) As most flights are redeye, and checkout is at noon -- with almost no opportunity for late checkout -- plan ahead for activities to keep the family occupied between checkout and your departure flight. Bottom line, though, is that this is a great vacation resort if you can afford it. ", " This was our first visit back to the Hilton since we moved to the Big Island. Our very first stay was many tears ago on our very first trip to Hawaii. This time we were given an upgraded room with a great view. We had a great time and we highly recommend this Hilton for a local get away. In addition, all first time visitors should stay here. We intend to reserve rooms for our sons and their families when they come for our 50th wedding anniversary this August ", " Overall, my husband and I love this property/resort and highly recommend it to our friends and families whenever possible. In fact, our daughter will be married near here in April and quite a few of the invited guests will be staying at the property on our recommendation. We most recently stayed 12/9-12/19/2015. This was our 25th wedding anniversary trip. As much as we love the property, I will say the following as a heads up: we booked the Makai mountainside room. We were not greeted nor treated to the Makai experience upon check in. No one was at the Makai desk. The room they gave us was not representative of the online picture (there is a disclaimer on the picture online to that effect but.....). Our view was mostly of a rooftop and parking lot beyond. Highly disappointing! Ask for the highest floor possible and closest to the main elevator if booking this level. Long story short we visited the front desk and related our concerns about the non-greeting and horrible view. The Hilton and Freda specifically exceeded our expectations by moving us to an ocean view room on the lagoon side ( FYI, this upgrade would be worth the $$ spent if booking Makai!). We also then experienced the Makai Aloha. Booking Makai does give you some great amenities. But, further on Freda, we just could not have been treated better by her. Impeccable customer service. On other heads up: eating at the Hilton restaurants can be pricey, but the food is delicious and the ambiance and convenience of eating on property delightful. There are also off property alternatives if you are the thrifty type, you can find deals and less expensive options. Be creative! Again, overall, we love this property and will return as often as we can. ", " This was our first trip to the Big Island, and I'm thrilled with our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. We stayed in a one-bedroom, Makai Suite. Loved the extra space and kitchenette, as well as the easy access to the pools, restaurants, etc. Yes, its pricey - but its Hawaii. ", " My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and we loved our stay. Beautiful landscaping, amazing pool/hot tub, great service, and good location. Breakfast was great and you should include it in your room rate. We had a lower class room and it was nice, but I would say it's a 3 star quality room. However, the bed was amazing and we slept great. The rest of the hotel was fantastic. Great for a family or couple. Worth the price! ", " We booked this property 8 months in advance so we would have time to research the area and resort itself. We could not find anything wrong!! Resort fees kinda suck but you pay those everywhere now. People complain about how big the resort is....I say stay home then!.....its not that big people!.....we could walk from one end to the other in 15 minutes and they have a tram that runs every 5 to 10 minutes. Some complain about the birds.....yes they are loud....never heard anything like it before in my life but we already knew about this so we brought a small fan and that was enough to \"drown out\" the noise at night (problem solved) Rent a car you will need it.....we did not have one everyday so we had to use the resorts shuttle service....(also great but not as good as having your own car!) Staff friendly!! Resort was clean like Disneyland! Some complain about food prices being high.....YES they are.....crazy high.....so we took all our business off property to the local restaurants and markets and saved a bundle and the food was most likely better as well. This place is so well spaced out that even when busy....this place seems empty. Overall we will be back. ", " When we first signed up to go here we thought it would be too glitzy for us with the train and all the swimming pools etc. But it turned out that the place is incredibly beautiful! We went in mid-February to get away from the cold in northern California. The weather was perfect. There were Asian statues everywhere. To us, this was a delight. We love the peaceful Buddhas meditating. There were few people there so we could enjoy snorkeling in the private beach. There were even dolphins there to watch! It's a great place! ", " This is a great property. It sits on about 60 acres and has a natural lagoon. The views are stunning. The best time to snorkel the lagoon is in the morning. You will see a lot of colorful reef fish as well as eels and the occasional sea turtle. It is open to the ocean so various marine life comes and goes. The swimming pools are incredible and there are several fine restaurants to choose from. There are also two golf courses. This is a great place to stay. ", " Loved the lagoon. Swim with the dolphins if you prefer. Snorkeling and great beaches close.Quick shuttle or walk down to the store and many great restaurants. Several good restaurants on the property as well.Highly recommend. ", " This report is simply fabulous. We enjoyed a true oceanfront room with an amazing view of the coast, ocean and even Maui 35 miles away! The property is perfectly maintained and very large so you never felt like you were in a crowd. At least we didn't. There are two main pool areas and one gets more crowded in that is your thing. We stayed at the other pool and it was nice and quiet. Our room (aside from the view) was nothing special, bit was large and clean. Who comes here to spend time in the room anyway? ", " Great visit, loved this facility, would go back in a heartbeat. Staff members were all very helpful and pleasant. We enjoyed all the pools and some of the waterslides. Ate at several restaurants on the premises and wonderful food at all of them. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa was an absolutely stunning property! My husband and I love to explore the islands and on this last trip, we never left the hotel grounds, aside from getting water and snacks and a visit to Mauna Kea for star gazing. There is so much to see and do on this property that we didn't have time to leave and explore anything else.Dolphins, flamingos, birds, fish, sea turtles...it was amazing. You can snorkel in the lagoon, not the best snorkeling experience but very convenient!Food was good, resort prices, but again convenient.We even had a couples massage and it was relaxing and wonderful.I can't wait to go back with my kiddos! ", " Had an excellent stay at the Hilton. Highly recommend this Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. Even though it was a busy time of year, all our needs were cared for and the service was quality. Mahalo. ", " We went as a family during the 2nd week of December. We loved it because it was so beautiful and clean. Lots of great art work. Check out all the buildings and grounds! We were in room 4018 in the ocean tower. We said good morning to about 8 cats we could see from our balcony along with some mongoose. The pools were awesome with lots of sections, some of which were shaded. No problem finding a chair to lounge in. The mai tais were delicious and cost $12. We didn't pay the fee to swim with the dolphins, but we could see them every day from a dock. We never turned our tv on because we kept busy checking out the island. Lots to see. ", " We have stayed at this property periodically since 2000 and love it more each time. The setting, size and spectacular views and features are amazing. My favorite place depends on time of day. Before dawn, I walk the property (bring a small flashlight) and the groundskeepers are cheerful and readying the property for the day. I sit by the dolphin lagoon and watch the dolphins swim naturally and talk to each other. Of course family breakfast at the Waters Edge. Then down to the lagoon. Here, we swim, snorkel and visit with the fish, sea turtles, etc. The Lagoon Grill serves you at your chaise (lunch, drinks, etc). In the late afternoon, another walk up by the KPC, through the Museum Walkway and back to Buddah's Point. Dinner -so many places to enjoy. This trip we dines at the Luau, Kamea Provision Company (twice) and Imari's. We reserved our KPC table for outside, ahead of sunset. In this way, we enjoyed sunset.Our daughter got a running trail map from the front desk and ran early in the mornings after sunrise. I did have one Kohala spa treatment!This time, we upgraded with extra points to a two-room suite in the Ocean Tower.But, all rooms are very spacious. And well appointed. The Kohala shampoos and conditioners are the best!All rooms spacious. Try to book at least a garden or ocean view.The Lagoon Tower and the Palace Tower are more central to property. The Ocean Tower is a bit of a walk, or monorail ride or boat ride - however we enjoyed the exercise. ", " The Hilton is the biggest hotel with the most on resort things going on. From its several pools, lagoon with jumping fish and sea turtles to snorkel with, to its trams and water taxis, to its multitude of restaurant options. It had everything we needed, to include ocean front rooms! I would highly recommend if you are a first time visitor or have a family. Kids will love it as you can let them roam but still keep your eyes on them. If you are looking for a more intimate hotel with less going on and a little more high end luxury for a couple seeking peace and quiet you may be able to find another option...but for us it was a great introduction to the big island. Also they have car rental and tour offices to handle whatever you need. ", " This resort has beach, lagoon with man-made little islands, boats, tram, dolphins, snorkeling sites, water falls, many pools, beautiful palm trees, huge romatic rooms with sliding glass doors opening to a breath-taking view. Words can't do justice to its beauty and magnificent landscape! We had a great 7 day stay at this wonderful hotel with lasting lifetime memories!Be sure to rent a car so you have freedom of choosing your meals ( much cheaper than forced eating at the resort), and you can do most of the tours in your car instead of signing up outrageously expensive group tours ", " Wow! Simply Wow! So we just happened to stumble upon this property and my cousin decided to use his points. First staying at Ocean tower and then moved to Palace tower for a suite. The stay was extremely comfortable and amazing choice of food. Needless to say the Lagoon has plenty of wildlife to experience. I would highly recommend this property irrespective of if you are traveling solo or with a huge family. It's definitely worth it! ", " I absolutely loved staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. My daughter and I stayed there for 7 days and apart from a few shopping excursions, we spent the majority of our time at the resort. There are several restaurants to suit pretty much any preference and/or price range. The resort is absolutely beautiful and there is no shortage of things to do. The pools are beautiful and were never too crowded, and the if you prefer salt-water, the lagoon is fantastic. While it's true this resort does not have a beach on the ocean, the Marriott Hotel is a short tram-ride away and has a gorgeous beach. All beaches in Hawaii are public so there is no problem with going there. ", " Excellent accommodations, wonderful view. Lots of pools and things to do. The mini-golf putting green was especially fun. The on-property restaurants were awfully pricey, but that's to be expected in Hawaii. ", " This is our second visit to Hilton Waikoloa. Our two teenage children came along and the Makai room has two queen beds. We were very comfortable and had a great view of the lagoon. The in-room coffee was lousy so the coffee house on site was doing very good business. We had a great time and will return again. ", " Great all-inclusive resort. Three pools, plenty of places to eat, dolphin pool, beach access (for snorkeling). Hours at restaurants are odd and the staff are not all pleasant - quite surprising how many staff and waiters were very rude to us, as that has never been our experience with Hilton properties. ", " Overall, a very nice hotel. Cost of food and beverages was quite high, so we ate off the premises or brought some food in and kept it in the mini-fridge. Otherwise, everything else about the hotel was excellent. We even saw two sea turtles and TONS of tropical fishes and eels in the ocean-fed lagoon on the hotel premises. Pretty amazing! ", " We last stayed here 18 years ago at Christmas and had a great experience. We have have wanting to return and finally did so. Simply another awesome experience. The hotel was only at 47% occupancy so it pretty much felt like we had the place to ourselves. The Christmas decorations were up and the grounds are beautiful to begin with and were only enhanced. The artwork lining the corridors rivals many museums and taking time to enjoy is a must. Of course, taking a boat or train to your room is another unique experience. Since our booked room was in a tower under renovation, they moved us to the Lagoon tower and put us in a suite overlooking the dolphin pool. The room was fabulous and we enjoyed one of the most comfortable beds we have had in a hotel. The service was outstanding and the staff helpful, friendly, and service-oriented. All in all, simply awesome and we hope to return in less time than previous. ", " We had a great stay. Team members are really engaged and welcoming. The boat landing Cantina team is great. Waikoloa Coffee shop is open very early . Try that if you wake up early, the coffee is outstanding. I think they need a Food Court with varieties in one place near the lobby. ", " This place is huge set on over 600 acres with guests housed in large \"towers\" dotting the property. The towers are connected by paths as well as a tram and a water taxi. The transportation and fantastic activities planned for children warrant the Disneyland reference. Sumptuous art work is also throughout the resort.Our room was spacious and well appointed. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable. We had a lovely view from our room and were able to maintain a very comfortable temperature with the excellent air-conditioning system. Hotel staff were first rate. Service could not have been better. Thought given to activities for children is exemplary as is the feeling of safety in the place. Don't miss the presentation by the Activities Director who not only let us know about the property but the host of off site activities--some of which should not be missed. There are two shopping centers close by which were exceptional. They were less than a mile walk plus there was a trolley from the hotel to the shopping centers as well. Food was as abundant with significant variety. Often the quality did not match the quantity and it was expensive. Advice for Elderly and/or folks with trouble walking: This hotel is not easy to navigate. Ask for a room close to the elevator if walking is an issue. The towers are very long and narrow. Although there were two elevators at either end of the Lagoon Tower, one elevator did not go down to the ground level--two sets of stairs had to be navigated to get to the main floor. This was great for us as we loved the exercise but we saw one couple that was not prepared for it. ", " This is the first time my husband and I have stayed at a resort. I wanted to stay at a place where we could snorkel and have wonderful restaurants/bars and shopping close by and not worry about driving. Since it costs $25/day to park your car, we were able to use the resort shuttle to go shopping at the King's and Queen's Shopping Center down the street. We found that it was very convienent to get around without a car and enjoy all the amenities. We stayed in the Ocean Tower, which was nice. In the room there was a coffee maker, safe, balcony, small frig. It was spacious and we didn't hear our neighbors at any time.I have to say that the swimming pools, lagoon, water slides, and hot tubs are off the charts AWESOME!! We can't wait to come back.PS Thr restaurants at the resort are great but Lava Lava restaurant down the street is the best!! ", " Wow. This place is incredible. The pictures on their website don't do it justice. Your not really staying at a hotel, you are staying in a village. There is actually a monorail that takes you to your hotel room because the place is so huge. You can also take the boat that runs along the moat laterr in the day instead of the monorail. There is a huge man made salt water beach lagoon where you can actually snorkel. Yes you can snorkel at your hotel. Not the best snorkeling obviously, I recommend going to a beach if your looking for good snorkeling but still cool that they have it. I did the dolphin quest as well which is a once in a lifetime experience. It's expensive but we'll worth the money, even though it doesn't last very long. But even if you don't do the quest, you can have lunch at a table overlooking the dolphin area and still get to see them from pretty close. There are many cats that roam the property as well which was pretty cool...and some mongooses. What else...oh...the decorations!! Statues everywhere you look. It looks like a palace. Huge pools, a golf course, mini golf, a waterslide. Waterfalls. Some coffee shops, restaurants, ice cream. Spectacular ocean views. The only reason you would not want to go here is if a resort this huge doesn't appeal to you and you are interested in something smaller, more low key. Sometimes if the monorail hadn't arrived yet we would just walk to our room. About a ten to fifteen minute walk to the ocean tower. So just make sure if you have somewhere you need to go leave a little early so you can walk or wait for monorail. Usually I only had to wait 7 minutes or less, but at night a little longer. We are active people so didn't mind walking if we didn't feel like waiting. ", " This resort is Disneyland for adults. The grounds and dwellings meticulously looked after, and staff were kind and obviously love working there too.We made it our 3 night base for this side of the Big Island, but really had no reason to leave there as it has everything. An added bonus of two resort shopping malls not far away, numerous restaurants, pool options, fantastic golf course, dolphin experience (to watch or join in the fun), amazing spa, cocktails, sensational luau, canal rides, trams running, fish - fish everywhere, corridor museum, easy and secure carpark, chapel, gardens .. so much to see and do here! Hand on heart, I cannot recall the last time I felt that relaxed. It was my first Hilton Village experience, and it most certainly will not be my last. ", " This hotel has beautiful grounds, fabulous art collection (be sure to take the art tour on Tuesday morning), beautiful pool areas, really anything you could want. They are in the process of updating the rooms - ours hadn't been done yet but was still very acceptable. Also, we had a great view of the pools and ocean. The staff was great - everyone we encountered couldn't have been nicer. Close to shops - we didn't rent a car because we could walk to everywhere or take the shuttle bus. Plenty of choices of bars and restaurants but pricey. The place is a walker's dream. ", " Had to jump on and add a review for this Hilton based on the amazing service that Ryan Tomm of this hotel offered.I was staying without a vehicle and desparately needed to mail a package out. The on-site mailing office had just closed in the early afternoon and I was quite upset.He heard my pleas for help and offered to take it and mail it out for me at the local post office and placed the mailing charge on my room.Ryan (superman) Tomm to the rescue!Great hotel and can't wait to go back! ", " A beautiful facility with much to do. The tram and boats make getting around this elaborate resort simple and convenient. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is adequate, although not elaborate; made to order omelets are great, as is the banana bread and other pastries. Only negative experience at this resort was that we were disappointed in the KPC restaurant; service was poor and my husband's entr\u00e9e was served cold and undercooked. Perfection is expected at their prices!! Loved the birds in the courtyard outside Lagoon Tower! ", " Don't leave this place! The rooms are really clean and with personal touches that make Hawaii truly feel like a dream. There are dolphins, sharks, and even a sea turtles in a bay pool. If you get tired you can ride the tran that circles the place. A very romantic escape. ", " This was our 6th year in a row staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, and it just keeps getting better. (Please see my write up from 10/31/14 for a more comprehensive review). Again this year we loved the beautiful rooms, lobby and grounds, the swimming pools, the Asian art, Buddha Point, the dolphins, the awesome ocean views, and great customer service.Making reservations and checking in and out were pleasant, easy experiences. We arrived too late for the restaurants except for Malolo Lounge, and we enjoyed its food, wine and great service-a nice relief after 18 hours in transit. As always, we ate several meals at the Kamuela Provision Company. We enjoyed wonderful food, wine, and outdoor seating with a view of the sunset over the ocean. Thank you Lily, Rowena, the chefs, and all our servers for making our dining experiences special. We love the location and the shore paths along the ocean either direction. The lovely Kohala Spa was a wonderful way to rejuvenate after our hikes and before our pool time. Thank you Mati for making sure I had enough of the delicious tea in the spa!We already have our reservations for next year, thanks to manager Ryan\u2019s great help. We can\u2019t wait to return. ", " I had a great time this last weekend at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. From the minute I arrived (which was very late/early in the morning) I was welcomed with open arms. It seems like it is the mission of the entire staff to make this the most enjoyable vacation of your life. I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations. Ocean view room in the Ocean tower was absolutely spectacular. I had great nights sleeping with the door open, listening to the surf and wind rustling the palm trees, on quite the comfortable bed. Resort was under a lot of construction when I was there, refreshing one of the pools and a caf\u00e9. However, that did not distract from the overall experience. Would highly recommend. Prices were actually a little less than I anticipated for dining/drinks. I know some Hawaiian resorts can get quite pricy. Nothing was \"cheap\" by any means, but much more reasonable. Only real \"downside\" I had was the bathroom. The toilet/shower room is very tiny, almost uncomfortable when you have to use the camode. However, that can't detract from an overall amazing trip! ", " Large resort with several pools, slides, dolphins, monorail, boats, snorkeling lagoon and plenty more. Lots of families with kids. Staff is helpful and rooms are clean, spacious and have a good view. Really good for families or couples. ", " Very welcoming staff, Great resort with heaps to do. Excellent pools for the kids and easy transport within the resort via shuttle train and boat rides. So many resturants and nearby shops with resturants. we just needed more time there. Price was affordable for family of 5 in 2 rooms compared to Aulani which was more expensive and less relaxing. We will return. ", " but the hotel truly felt like a resort. I especially enjoyed riding the free boat transport during the night time. The lady sitting across me pulled up her mobile app that mapped out the stars and showed it to us. Seeing the dolphins, and sharks up close. I wished we had more time to stay, but definitely worth re-visiting. ", " We spent Thanksgiving on the Big Island this year, and needed a place to have Thanksgiving dinner. We chose the Hilton Waikoloa Village Thanksgiving Buffet, and are so happy that we did. Patrick Cowan, and his staff really made our meal special. Since four of our party required gluten free food, due to allergies, we talked to the wait staff upon our arrival. They brought out a chef who walked us through the buffet line to advise us which foods were safe for us to eat. They even brought out two gluten free desserts that were not on the regular dessert cart: a delicious flourless chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cr\u00e8me brule. The range of foods was impressive with three carving stations, and what seemed like an unlimited variety of salads and side dishes. If you have allergies, and are looking for a place to have a special dinner, I strongly recommend the Hilton. We dined at several restaurants in the complex and found them to be most accommodating. Thanks, Hilton, for making our Thanksgiving special. ", " This is my first post, but wanted to send some major shouts out! In no particular order & all meant some much to us: This is our fifth year at the resort. First, to Nicholas, you got us an amazing room! We thank you for that! You worked hard & kept working days after to get us an amazing suite!Second, Brandon, Timmy, & Brian. You are amazing at what you do. Know that you leave such a positive and lasting impression & you are forever remembered!!!! You are all so kind & welcoming! Brandon especially (our hearts are fond of you for our years of your service). And lastly,Crystal, thank you for allowing the volleyball today. My family appreciates it & mostly to Cherokee & Ha'a for putting it up!!! It was awesome, thanks so much!!!Also valet, Neil, you are so great at what you do!!! Thank you for everything you did to help us this trip(and the other years! You are amazing also!)To end, our thanks are not to the Hilton property as much they are to the employees who welcome us each year & make us feel so welcomed. Aloha & Mahalo to you all!!! The Siebert Family ", " We were based at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for our stay at the western side of the Island, and travelled everywhere from here. It's located just in the middle of everything, so if you don't want to just spend the day at the pool, drive in any direction and experience something awesome.The resort is gigantic, with it's own tram line (which is on the slower side, so you can get around faster by walking, but it's air conditioned..). The prices are similar to what you'd expect at a resort, on the more expensive side - but Imari, their Japanese restaurant, was a very good experience. We enjoyed the ala carte more than the teppanyaki, so I'd recommend doing that instead.Stayed at the top floor at the Ocean Tower, and while the birds can be noisy, it just added to the experience. They get quiter as soon as the sun as come down (and coming from the Hilo side with the frogs, I'll take the birds anytime).We were greeted at the HHonors desk by the very friendly and knowledgeable Frank, and he made sure our stay was top notch. BTW: You get complementary Wi-Fi without signing in with HHonors, as it's included in your resort fee. The Wi-Fi was spotty at times, but as soon as all the kids on the resort went to bed, speeds increased. Weird.We'll be coming back next time we're at Big Island! I also have to give credit to the bars and restaurants for having good, non-alcoholic options on the drink menu. ", " This was a family vacation of 4 rooms and 9 people. We received excellent attention and service from the moment we arrived and were greeted at the Makai desk by Nick. He promptly gave us our room keys and other helpful information. We soon entered our room, then proceeded to the pools. (Nick also assisted us throughout the week.) I had purchased the inclusive package and we all really appreciated and enjoyed the Big Island Breakfast buffet with special attention from the staff - Ululani, Noelani, Nobert and Vanessa. The evening dinners at KPC were delicious, gourmet and with beautiful presentation. Service from Cornelius, Eliezer and Laura at KPC was professional and friendly. Evenings at Imari and the Luau were also enjoyed by all. The entire staff: front desk, concierge, room custodians, pool/bar employees and all restaurant employees were well trained in giving great customer service. We enjoyed the dolphin experience with our grandkids. Special thanks again to Nick for assisting in making our family vacation a memorable time. We recommend the Hilton Waikoloa to all. ", " This place was great, so much fun, I totally loved it.I recommend that if you can stay here, its totally worth it, it has everything you can possibly like on a Hawaiian vacation. The room service was great, there was a luau the show was amazingly great too. ", " Best hotel stay of my life,bring your family for all the fun and activities. Extra friendly staff, great food, great view of the ocean. Our grandkids wanted to live there. Close to shopping center with entertainment and activities, great foodcourt. ", " I've been here twice now, can't wait for the next time. I love this resort, it's beautiful, not a far drive from so many other things to do and just spectacular. I can't say enough good things about Hilton Waikoloa. ", " We went early April and stayed for ten days.snorkeling with wild sea turtles was amazing the resort is huge! Definitely recommend the luau, all the restaurants had great food, there's waterfalls even trolley to shops. Stay here! ", " We spent only one night at this amazing resort because we also had a timeshare exchange at the same time. BUT, we love the Hilton Waikoloa and wanted to visit the property as hotel guests. As Platinum members, we were upgraded to a larger unit, which turned out to be a one bedroom apartment with five balconies giving us a panoramic view of the island. To be honest, it was very hard to leave the room. But leave we did to enjoy the pool, the grotto, the restaurants and the charming transportation on boats and monorails. We loved walking through the covered walkways adorned with beautiful art representing the rich culture. We ate at the Kamuela Provision Company, which set a table under the stars on the patio with the sound of the waves surrounding us. I also had a facial at the Kohala spa, which was heavenly. We'll be back!! ", " An absolutely wonderful stay! My wife and I came here after spending a week in Kona which we thought was great until we experienced Waikaloa.The grounds were immaculate and very extensive. From the turf-like grass to the trimmed-up palms, nothing was in need of attention. The 'public' bathrooms were spotless, and the pools free of even plant debris.Our room perhaps shaded my view on the resort as we somehow lucked into one of two rooms with the spectacular view given to us. Looking around, it didn't seem that ANY rooms had BAD views, ours was just borderline stupendous!The inhouse restaurants were all good and we went to all but Imari. Nothing against Asian food, just a too short stay!While the trams and boats were in operation, this resort was not so big as to make walking impossible. With the delicious food, it was almost required so as to burn the extra calories off!One could use walking as their exercise, or one could use one of the plentiful pools. If a couple acres of pool is not enough, there is also a saltwater lagoon where one can swim with fish and turtles!This hotel did not seem like a hotel, more like a mixture between Los Vegas and Disneyland, only tropical!Added to the fantasy was the shark area coupled with the dolphin area. A hotel that has dolphins. I'm rendered speechless.If we ever make it to the Big Island again, we'll have to plan a return trip!And this, our first to Hawai'i!MAHALO! ", " Enjoyable time. Courteous and thoughtful staff. Courtesy shuttle a real plus. Plenty to do with swimming everywhere and a special adult only pool. Restaurant accommodates special diets. Can't wait till I can bring the grandkids over to swim w Dolphins. ", " Stay here if coming to Kona. Have stayed here numerous times over the year and never-ever disappoints \u2013 the rooms, hospitality, resort grounds and beautiful sunsets make it a great location. We always come right before Thanksgiving so the resort is never full and the evenings are quiet and make for a magical experience\u2026..let me offer a few tips to help with your stay:Room: Book the Lagoon Tower (Ocean Side) and ask for a room on the 3rd or higher floor as you get a spectacular view and priority/reserved seating by the pool. Also really close to the gym and overlooks the dolphin pool.Amenities: Negotiate the breakfast buffet into your room rate as it a very good buffet with many options to choose from and a good way to start your day. There is no real other option for breakfast so you have to go off property for breakfast. The gym/spa is very nice and the gym is included in your room \u2013 if you like Tennis, they have some great courts. Wifi is fast and there is a very nice bar on property with a super bartender and good drinks\u2026prices are of course resort prices so be ready.Restaurants: There is a nice Steak & Fish restaurant on property \u2013 great for seeing the sunset so book an outside table as eating inside loses something. Dinner for two, with a drink and no wine will easily go over $100 so be ready\u2026.we had dinner there (Swordfish & Tenderloin) and it was super and worth the price. View made the dinner \u2013 here it\u2019s all about the view. If you can\u2019t get outside recommend you go eat somewhere else.Saving $$$ for Other Things: If a HH member, resort provides a $10/pp coupon for day good for drinks and eats so you can present when ordering and get things for less. Approx 5-min drive or 15-min walk there are two malls with a grocery store (wine, food, etc.), restaurants (Macaroni Grill, etc.) and a food court (Dairy Queen, Local Grinds, Thai, etc.) help keep the cost down. Rooms have a frig so can put stuff in it and many take snacks and food to the pool to eat and just order a drink\u2026..hotel has no problems with this. Resort Lagoon: Before booking a snorkeling trip go snorkel in the lagoon \u2013 I\u2019ve snorkeled all over the islands and you will see just as many fish, turtles and island life in this lagoon as you will on a tour\u2026.and for lot less. Snorkel early morning (after 8am and once the sun is up) and you can spend hours swimming with the turtles, fish and eels.Hilton Vacation Club: We are Wyndham Vacation owners so had no plans to buy anything yet did the 2-hour presentation for $200 so we could apply to our resort bill (cannot apply to room cost) for food, resort fee and parking\u2026..no pressure at all at event and we were done fast. As a result we had our dinner paid for at the steak restaurant and some drinks as well\u2026.This resort is big \u2013 but yet never feels crowded or overpowering. It is designed to offer the Island spirit and allow you to relax with Aloha provided by the resort staff \u2013 that is exactly what we planned for and received the 4 days we were here. We will come back again\u2026. ", " There's so much exploring to do at this one place. From riding the trams and boat or just walking the property, there so much to see that you'll want to plan extra time. The staff is friendly. Becky and Kehau at Kohala Spa was wonderful. Enjoyed late night nachos with drinks at Boat's Landing - it was so festive. The food at the Waters Edge Breakfast Buffet was so go with so much variety and selections. I love the renovations done to the Palace Tower. ", " This is a huge property located in the Waikoloa beach resort area approx 35 mins north of the Kailua-Kona Intn'l Airport. Rooms are located in one of three towers (Ocean Towers, Lagoon Towers, or Palace Towers, which is being renovated) that are are connected by a tram system and, in the afternoon and evening, a boat system. The rooms are spacious, well decorated, well maintained; in the Ocean Tower, the rooms have balconies which either overlook Mauna Kea in the distance or the Hilton beach and ocean. There are numerous coffee shops with breakfast noshes, restaurants (Big Island breakfast buffet, Japanese, Italian, Boat Landing Cantina for a limited Mexican menu, Maholo Lounge), and an excellent spa with exercise equipment, steam rooms, saunas, and whirlpools. All of the staff are extremely friendly, welcoming, and friendly.It will take a day to get fully oriented and find everything at the property, which is part of its charm. There are numerous tour and travel shops at the hotel to help you decide on activities off property - zip-lining, volcano hiking, botanical garden touring, etc. If you are ever confused, just stop to ask any of the hotel staff (and don't forget to say \"aloha\").The property is huge - 62 acres developed in 1988 - and has its own sand beaches, walking paths, swimming pools, lounge chairs, and snack bars. It has its own somewhat limited shopping area. The convention center is very large and meeting spaces are convenient to the general session halls. Convention food was generally above average and the wait staff were excellent.Downside, however, to all the fun in the sun is that there is nothing inexpensive about the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort, and some prices were truly eye-opening. So, go to the lower lobby, catch an open-air tram for a small fee to the Princess Marketplace or King's Shops about a mile away for more reasonable restaurants, clothing, and deli-market. If you leave the resort area, you will need a car or friends with a car unless you have bought a tour package. Hilo is about 2 hours east if you take the north coast route or 1 hr 30 mins+ if you take Hwy 200 across the middle of the island; Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a good 2 hr 30 min+ using the south coast road. Be careful because some rental car companies do not authorize use of their cars to South Point or to the top of Mauna Kea or to Waipio Valley. While the Waikoloa area is on the \"dry side\" of the island, take a rain poncho or umbrella for the north, south, and east coasts.Overall assessment is that the resort is pricey but you receive a lot of value in return. Would I stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort again - yes, absolutely! ", " Sure, this resort is HUGE and overflowing with amazing scenery and ambience, and sure it's PERFECT for families with young children BUT what about the adults that are still \"children at heart\"? YES!!! Some folks want some type of secluded, ritzy little resort where staff waits on them and kisses their lil tushies to help feel superior and priveleged, but TRUE ALOHA exists here at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort and you can FEEL the genuine concern for guests here! From the moment we rolled into valet, Lopaka helped with the car and Gerry assisted with luggage...both having been at the resort for over 20 years! Then Shawn, the amazing concierge at the HHonors desk was a GODSEND! She took great care of us, answered all questions, and even assisted in booking our upcoming stay in two week!!! SHAWN sets the example of how all others in this industry should be measured! Even the gentleman who delivered our bags was kind and hospitable...even grabbing ice for the bucket in our room! Hilton Waikoloa is a winner across the board...and it's all based around their true Spirit of Aloha!!! ", " This is my second visit to the Big Island and to the Hilton. The Hilton facilities and tourist opportunities on the Island give you many options, so do some pre-arrival research and planning for your stay. The Hilton has much to offer as well and could become your whole vacation, should you choose. You will enjoy your time on the Big Island doing whatever you decide to do. Enjoy, we did! ", " This hotel had more than I could imagine. I took my grandson and daughter. The grounds were Beautiful and plenty of activities galore. We had Dolphins below our balcony room and saw very large sea turtles and lots of fish. The pool was awesome with caves and a slide, and they had a lagoon to swim in also. The lagoon had paddleboats and paddle boards and snorkeling gear. Very refreshing! The rooms were very clean,spacious and comfortable. We traveled to 2 other islands, Oahu and Maui. This was by far my Favorite! The food was good. Lots to do on this island. The volcano and zip lining at Akaka Falls is a Must Do! ", " Fantastically beautiful resort. It was clean, lovely and elegant. There is something for everyone.When we were there, there were so many three generational families. I don't think I've ever see so many parents, children and grandparents in one resort. There is something for everyone.The only negative is that it has a limited number of places to eat and the restaurants are open at certain times which may or may not be convenient for families. This also makes it more expensive if one wants to save some money on food. There was a fridge in the room, but no microwave where we stayed.A shuttle runs every 20 minutes from the hotel to two shopping centers-- $2 for one way. One could buy some food at a market or go to another restaurant outside the resort with a car or taking the shuttle. Parking is not free.One should really look at the web site for ideas of things to do there. ", " This is what Hawaii is supposed to be like. It's so beautiful with exotic birds and a lagoon with waterfalls. It's so huge that to get around to all the shops, restaurants luaus and spa, you may want to take the air conditioned tram or boats around the property. But the BEST part of the resort is the employees! The front desk was warm and responsive, the people cleaning the rooms and the servers at the restaurants. Be sure to go to the Big Island Breakfast - a little pricy but you have to try it. If you are lucky Chris will make your omelette- (the best-yummy) and ask Esther at the hostess desk to seat you at one of Vanessa's tables. She is a delight, an island native who brought joy to us every morning! The place is a dream anyway, but we'll be back just to see her. ", " The weather was beautiful all 4 days we stayed. Amazing views of the ocean all the time. All of the staff we encountered we considerate and respectful. I personally found Ernette set the tone for a beautiful experience as she provided us with information and checked us in. My 20 month old son was entertained the entire time from the pools, lagoon, slides, boat ride, and the tram. My husband and I were very pleased to learn that our sons breakfast and lunch were free when we ordered our meal. ", " Our family enjoyed every minute of our stay. It was clean and comfortable. My son enjoyed the pool and my husband loved the beautiful scenery that outlined the hotel. Definitely will be coming back again! ", " My wife and I stayed here our anniversary week and absolutely loved it. Everything you need is at the resort. Wonderful staff and grounds. Majority of the views are breath taking. Only wished we had better planned our trip to take full advantage of all resort has to offer. Definitely will return!! ", " Stayed here over night last week and it was one of the most beautiful resorts I have ever stayed in. A friend is from Honolulu and took us on a 2 day tour of the Big Island. She booked the Hilton and we were not disappointed. The ocean deluxe rooms were stunning, the view of the ocean was beautiful. The pools were amazing. I have never seen a monorail and boat drive around a resort before. The restaurant for dinner was beautiful. Would love to return. Would highly recommend to any traveller, single, couple or families. Just sit back and relax. ", " We stayed here 4 nights to start our Hawaiian vacation. This is a large resort with a lot to offer. We got adjoining rooms to accommodate ourselves and our 2 children. A train takes you to the main lobby area to the building you stay at. This was our base to discover the big island. Off site we did a Sunshine Helicopter tour that left from Kona and flew over the volcano. On site we swam with dolphins at the natural lagoon at Dolphin Quest. We greatly enjoyed our stay at this resort and would stay here again. ", " This is our fourth stay at the Hilton Waikoloa and it will not be our last. We have been there as a couple and with family (grandparents and kids). This place has something for everyone. The grounds are beautiful but more importantly the staff is excellent. Everyone cares and if they can't help you, they take the time to find someone who can help. We will definitely be back. ", " This was an excellent place to visit! Love the shopping, eating, pool and beach. There's a boat and a train you can take from one end to the other. So much to do and see. Very cool place! I'm not sure about the rooms as we stayed at the Bay Club but would trade in a heartbeat! ", " Our Stay at the Hilton Waikaloa was bar none. Every hotel employee we met was friendly and helpful above their call of duty. The hotel was gorgeous and the amenities more than what we even knew we needed. We would absolutely stay there again and again. ", " We booked this week as part of a vacation plan sales promotion in order to stay at a very reduced rate including a car rental, and our room in the Makai tower which had more amenities. Upon arrival, we dropped off our luggage at the large lobby, then parked the rental car in the large parking area lower down the hill. I had been told by the phone sales rep that parking would cost $18/day, but the rates were $25/day self-parking, and $30 for valet parking. We were able to live with that. Since we were booked under the Hilton Grand Vacations plan, we were first shown the hotel site (huge). I would have appreciated being shown our room directly so we could leave the luggage and rest after a long flight. Be prepared for very warm and humid weather; the long lanai gallery leading to the rooms is roofed, but open to the air. Pools are plentiful. The resort does show its nearly 30 year condition, but seems to be maintained and cleaned at a high level. We enjoyed all of the birds and the mongoose who scampered around the landscaping. The dolphin lagoon is a great place to have lunch at the grill overlooking it. Loved driving around the island and especially recommend a trip to the Tropical Botanical Garden north of Hilo. The Volcano National Park can't be missed, and try to stay to see the glowing crater after dark. The drive back to the resort takes about 2 to 2 and a half hours across the Saddle road, but is worth the time. The various on site eating establishments serve good \"eats\" from open-air grills (Mexican and hamburger places) to fine dining and a pizza place open only for dinner. Expect to spend more for food, but there is a small market /shopping area nearby. We stocked up on some grocery items to cool in the small room fridge, and ate breakfast in the room. October was a great time to visit...fewer crowds and since we're retired the paucity of noisy kids was so nice. My only major complaint is that Hilton allows outside commercial tenants on site (Adore luxury cosmetics) whose sales people reflect poorly upon the relaxing environment. How many times have I encountered these young Israeli guys in malls, conferences, public venues who aggressively accost vacationers and want to convince you to buy $1000's of dollars of low quality supposedly luxury cosmetics. They claim to be Italian, etc, but they are here on visitor visas, and probably illegally involved in this sales commission job for the time they're in the US. Very annoying, and makes me wonder why Hilton allows such ventures on their property. Creepy guys, inappropriate touching, lying, bait and switch tactics, and their tobacco breath was a real distraction. Sorry to go on and on, but I keep thinking about them on our first day at the resort. My point is that I would have rated this resort as the best I'd visited, but that Adore store was a negative experience. I don't think my comments to the three people we met with at our sales presentation will have any impact on this experience, but at least I brought it up after we declined purchasing a vacation plan. ", " We loved the service, the location, the food and the rooms. It's a very large hotel, that makes you slow down and relax to the vacation mode. It was Hawaii and Asia in terms of the environment and the art collection was just plain awesome. We love it! ", " What a great place to relax and enjoy the views! Huge property with numerous pools and activities. Some of the restaurants are a bit pricey but the food is really good nonetheless. Breakfast buffet is outstanding; better way to go than coffee and continental option. Hotel offers free tram and boat rides around the property. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is one of the best Hawaiian resorts I have ever visited. The staff are amazing and it is very wide-open and brimming with new things. It is large to the point they have a canal and tram for efficient and luxurious transportation. The rooms were very nice and those weren't even the VIP ones so I can only imagine what the Kings Suites were like. The lagoon is extraordinary and while the prices are a bit high for the average traveler, they are no problem at all and worth the price completely. There is a ton of sea life in the lagoon but there are no people patrolling, so it is ignorant people's paradise. Beware of the random tourist snapping photos of a bright fish while you are on your paddle board. I got rammed by an ignorant family on a kayak who didn't apologize and cut up my foot pretty bad. It is not dangerous however, and all the water is no deeper than 10-15 feet. The pools are exquisite and the caverns and slides are amazing pieces of engineering and fun. The restaurants are also extremely nice and there is one overlooking a pebble beach which, at sunset, is amazing. The staff are all friendly and the people staying are generally polite. ", " We stayed in the Makai Tower, with a partial view of the ocean and full view of the mountain. We saw green sea turtles, swam with the dolphins at Dolphin Quest, relaxed in the pool, rode the water slide, and took the transport boats and the tram to get from one end of the resort to the other. The Legends of Hawaii Luau was a great show. We captured amazing sunset photos from the walkways. We enjoyed the tasty breakfast and relaxing view of the water.Early in the morning (about 5am) there are some very loud birds near the boat channel that will stop about 5:10am, but other than that, everything else was wonderful!It was about 40 minutes from the airport. ", " My wife and I love this resort. I recommend staying in the Makai Tower. The ocean view is amazing and you have a lot more perks when you'll stay at the Makai. You get free daily access to spa amenities, your own pool side chairs, your own private concierge and check in. Plus you are in the middle of all the main amenities. It's a huge resort. 63 acres I think. You can take a train or boat across the resort. There is a dolphin pool, shark pool, and a private lagoon where I've always seen at least 4 sea turtles everytime I have swam there. Breakfast is a must to include in your stay as it is very good and you will save money in the long run as you won't need lunch and do an early dinner. Great place. Enjoy! ", " We spent a week in this truly gorgeous hotel in late October 2015 and have just returned. Rooms, location, dining ,everything was wonderful. Yes it's expensive but really, it's The Hilton and the experience it offers is magical. We stayed in the ocean tower with a fantastic view of the Pacific from our huge room and spacious balcony. Breathtaking.! Wonderful comfy beds the room and resort has everything you could possibly want.. The staff are friendly and very helpful. A real treat. ", " had a wonderful halloween weekend trip.the pools were awesome.nice staff. the weather was perfect for october.my 5 yr old son enjoyed the trick or treat that the hotel had set up for the kids. dolphin experience is interesting. wish we could go more often.once a year is great. its good for the kids or the young couples. ", " My husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary at the Hilton Waikoloa. This was also our first visit to Hawaii. The hotel staff provided top notch service from check-in until our departure from room service, advice on activities, to renting a car. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite in the Ocean Tower which had a wonderful view of the pool and ocean. The room was modern, clean and very comfortable. The resort was a peaceful relaxing place. Unlike other reviewers, we had no problem with the bird noise in our room - possibly because the bedroom of our suite was away from the door to the room. It is quite a walk from the lobby to the Ocean Tower (about .3 mile) but there is a train and boat you can take to the room. The walk is rather nice - with museum pieces along the walkway. I enjoyed getting out and walking around each day. The restaurants are excellent but you will pay a premium. Dinner at sunset was an amazing experience. We did not go to the Luau during our stay. This is a pricey resort, but the experience was amazing! I hope to return in the future. ", " I just concluded a stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village.I took my wife and 7 month old boy.We had an amazing time. We stayed on-site the entire time. We didn't see a need to leave. Which, let's talk about food. There are a number of restaurants on-site. They are in the pricey side, but that's to be expected with restaurants found at a resort. The food and service was absolutely amazing at all of them. I wouldn't recommend one over another as they're were awesome in their own ways. Fantastic selection as well. From Sushi to Italian to Mexican.There's plenty to do on-site. From swimming with Dolphins, Snuba, to kids clubs. They have two huge pool areas. So, although you may look at the resort map and only see two pools. What you can't see on the map is that they're enormous. Each is an entire pool system complete with waterfalls and slides. That being said, it's a great place for kids as well. Kids of all ages work well here. If you don't want to be around kids. They also have an adults only pool.The rooms are wonderful and are well situated throughout the resort. They are broken up into three main building. One negative aspect in my mind about the hotel is the enormity of it. It's HUGE! it's big enough that they have a tram that runs throughout the middle of it. You wouldn't want to walk from the lobby to the ocean tower for instance as that's a solid 12 minute walk. Imagine doing it with luggage! They also have these old fantastic boats that provide as a method of transportation if you don't want to use the tram. It's a great way to see the resort and get to where you need to go.One last piece about this gem of the Pacific. You're surrounded by wildlife! If not the Dolphins swimming up to you in the lagoon, or the turtles and flamingos taking a look at you as you head to the pool, it's the amazing songs you'll be graced with from the amazing birds as you drink your morning coffee. It's one of the best parts of the trip and it's absolutely free!! If it wasn't for those pesky Agricultural guys at the airport, I would have smuggled one of those tweeters home with me!All in all, it's a fantastic hotel. The grounds are immaculate. The pools are clean. The people are extremely friendly and helpful. The food is great. You can get good room rates. This hotel is a winner! ", " When we arrived at the hotel, my daughter's first words were \" this place is awesome!\"We were there for a family wedding for 4 days and stayed at the Makkai rooms on the Lagoon side. Our room overlooked the ocean and the dolphin swim and the lagoon. There were so many activities you can do on the premises. The check in was quick and easy with HHonor rep. Our room was clean but could do without having the carpet. We didn't spend too much time in the room anyways, so as long as it was clean and comfortable, we were happy. The tram and boat rides were easy ways to get around the resort, especially having to go from one end of the resort to the other in heels. The boat ride at tonight is so awesome with stars above you and comfortable light breeze. The location of the hotel is close to shopping and other water activities. We went to the Queen's market to eat dinners and shopped. So if you have a car, your don't have to stay in hotel for meals. If you are a early riser due to the time change, the coffe/breakfast bar opens at 6am in the morning in the Lagoon tower. The ladies are friendly and will give you advise on where to go , if you ask. They have a yummy breakfast smoothie and various coffee selections and breakfast food. There is also a UPS on site to help you with packing and shipping the extra items. Definitely ask the activity desk for booking excursions and activities. They will give you good recommendations since there are so many different choices. Also, take advantage of Sunday Funday! Best ever. ", " My wife and I visited Hawai'i to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and decided to return to the Hilton Waikoloa where we stayed five years ago.We could not have been made more welcome and the hotel staff made a real fuss of us over our anniversary.We stayed in the Ocean Tower with a stunning view over the hotel grounds and the Pacific Ocean. Breakfast was included in the package and the breakfast buffet was by far the best I've ever enjoyed. Lots of facilities including a sea-fed lagoon which had sea turtles and a huge variety of tropical fish to enjoy. Good selection of eateries - Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese and traditional American. Safe swimming areas for little ones and a choice of pools if you didn't want to swim in the lagoon.Downsides? The room service is incredibly expensive - best to eat in the hotel restaurants or eat out and there is a daily 'resort fee' of $25 which quickly mounts up.Overall though, a great resort which goes to prove the old adage that you get what you pay for. ", " We stayed here using a five night package deal offered through the Hilton Grand Vacations Club, using it as our base for exploring the Big Island. We hardly spent any time on the grounds (which are beautiful), so can't talk about all the activities and amenities, but they seemed to be what you would expect from a luxury resort. It never felt crowded, and if you were so inclined, you'd never have to leave the grounds or go any further than the shopping and dining at King's Shops or Queen's Marketplace just down the road. If you're planning to get out and about, it's easy to get to Kona; Waimea; Hawi; the nearby beaches; even Hilo is not a bad drive. Plan a day away if you're going to the volcano, though.We had a nice, standard room in the Ocean Tower. This is the furthest building from the main entrance, so it takes a little more time to get to the parking lot for in-and-out trips. On the other hand, it is the closest to Buddha Point, which is where we went almost every night to watch the sunsets. We took almost all our meals off the property (other than the first morning, when we were stuck with the ridiculously expensive buffet breakfast) so can't speak to the dining choices. There is a mini-fridge and a Keurig coffee maker in the room and you can ask for a microwave, so if you are so inclined it is possible to do a continental breakfast in your room and pack up some picnic lunches if you're heading out for the day. There is a market in Queens Marketplace where you can shop. ", " An amazing village ,with stunning views and great beaches.Its never a diappointment to visit such a place,for memorable expereiences at least once in life.The food is great as well and bravo to the ever smiling service team. ", " We stayed two weeks at the Bay Club and although we had a parking lot, first floor view, we enjoyed this place very much. Used the grills on several occasions and lots to do and see on the complex. Free movies for the room, and quick access to the island main roads. Wonderful vacation!! ", " My family of four (wife and two kids age 13 and 11) stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for a week in July and enjoyed every minute of it. I was a little nervous after reading reviews that the pool area was crowded and service was somewhat lacking, but we never felt crowded during our stay, never waited more than five minutes for breakfast or dinner (we only ate at the italian restaurant) and never had an issue with finding a chair at the pool for the three days we lounged around the hotel. The food was expensive, although I didn't feel it was ridiculous compared to other hotels in Hawaii or some of the nicer restaurants around the Big Island. There is a Macaroni Grill in the Queens Mall area nearby that I suspect is cheaper, but it is a Macaroni grill in a mall as opposed to a nice table on the beach. The valet parking was relatively efficient every time we used it (which was at least once every day). I do wish there was a concierge that you could know was only there to help and not out for a commission on a time share, but the pushiness was not terrible and it was only if we asked something, not on an unsolicited basis. Terry at the Cabana and Sports was great and did everything to accomodate our needs. I would recommend the 65 dollar cabana for two if available as it offers the shade I personally enjoy when relaxing at a hotel, but it is not necessary to secure someplace to sit. I have to give a particular shout out to Ryan Tomm - Front Desk Assistant Manager. He went well beyond what he needed to to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We were upgraded to the Makai rooms and enjoyed watching the dolphins from our balcony. I agree with some of the other posts that the hotel has a little disney feel to it, but I don't think it is all bad - swimming comfortably with my kids in the lagoon without worry about the waves and having sea turtles by our side was disneyesque and also wonderful. Finally, the hotel is large, but the walk from one end to the other is really not bad. My girls did it regularly and it only takes a few minutes. I understand the concerns if you are elderly or physically compromised in some way, but for anyone without those issues it is not a problem at all. As a Diamond member for years I do expect a certain level of service from Hilton and truly felt this resort delivered. We look forward to visiting again. ", " We definitely had a very enjoyable stay at this Hotel. The front desk employees were very helpful, they made us feel comfortable even when we had tons of questions and there is a line of other folks behind us. They made sure all our concerns were answered.The room maids, room service, and security were all very mindful and respectful. We had an issue with our door lock that needed to be replaced so we could not enter the room, but the hotel employees made the issue transparent by providing us options.The morning buffet breakfast had excellent food and the employees there were very nice as well. Since we were there in the summer (July), it could be very crowded especially in the weekends, but the lines go fast.Our kids really enjoyed the huge pools and the slide near the Lagoon tower.All in all, our stay in this hotel was very comfortable, enjoyable and pleasant. ", " I am a pilot and therefore travel is a normal thing. This resort exceeded our expectations. I took the time to read all reviews and this looked like the best option for our family with twin nine year old boys. We booked through Costco which was great as usual and I recommend Costo's travel insurance for just in case. There are many things that stand out about this resort, but the people are at the top of the list. Most of the staff are locals and everyone was very nice, helpful, and sincere. I want to thank Jessica at the front desk, Vanessa at the Lagoon Grill, Kai at Imari, Val in reservations, and Carol with activities.We chose the Makai Tower as it was closest to the pool with the larger water slide and the lagoon. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. You can set the fan for the air conditioning to be continuously \"On\" by the thermostat controls. I mention this because we like the consistent background sound when sleeping. Yes its a big property but my kids enjoyed riding the monorail and the boat that goes in a loop. The boat was great to ride at night also. There was a Waikoloa Coffee close by which was nice in the morning. You really never need to leave the resort if you didn't want to. We loved being at the pool then the lagoon in the afternoon. It was nice eating lunch at the Lagoon Grill and watching the dolphins while eating. Food here is crazy expensive with the exception of the Lagoon Grill. There is the Queens Market nearby that has a full market and food court. I would look at Yelp for other dining options, but its all expensive. We did the buffet breakfast in the morning as it was included in our Costco package. The breakfast was phenomenal. I loved the omelette bar and Chris was fantastic at the cooking!The Luau was one of the highlights for us. I looked into other places and felt the Hilton was going to put on the most professional show. It was amazing and the kids loved it. I was able to pick up the tickets in the lobby a few hours prior so I didn't need to wait in line. It is recommended that you get there early so you can get a better seat. We did the valet instead of self park because it was only $5 more a day. It was nice just calling down to the valet and having the car right up front waiting. Then you simply drop off and the car is taken for you. We bought waters and stocked our fridge. Next time we would get more lunch items to cut the costs down. We look forward to going back! ", " If you are into big - then you will LOVE this hotel! You can opt for a gondola ride or a tram to take you to each section of the resort! The scenery is absolutely breathtaking... I couldn't stop taking pictures! I loved being able to see my feet in the ocean (we don't get that in California ) The pools were AWESOME... there were so many to choose from... and little areas of privacy too. This is def one of my top fave hotels! ", " My husband and I stayed here for a few nights in May 2015 for our honeymoon. We got a Makai room in the Lagoon tower and requested a top floor room that's closest to the ocean, and that's what we got! The rooms were nicely renovated and very clean. We enjoyed watching the dolphins swim with guests or trainers from our room. The grounds were nice too! We liked just walking around and exploring. We rode the monorail several times and the boat a few times. Riding the boat at night time is magical! We ate at the pizza place next to the little river, and we tried the special sunset dinner. We enjoyed all the food they had there. You really could spend your whole vacation at this one hotel if you wanted to! ", " Are you tired of me writing about the amazing experiences I and my family continue to have at Hilton Waikoloa Village? I hope not. This year's visit exceeded more than 10 previous visits.Having given my girls an option again (13 and 9 years old) to go anywhere in the World, and stay at any hotel or resort, they once again asked me to book the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I was as excited as they were to return.The hotel has had a small facelift since I was there last, either that or everything just seemed ultra, ultra clean.What didn't change was the hospitality and customer service. And the consistency of the staff. From Brian the bartender to MJ in the Japanese restaurant who has a roll named after her (delicious), to the same front desk staff. Everyone you ask has been there forever. Why? Because they love working there.We had a full ocean view room which was spectacular. We had one night of rain, but remember, the Hilton sits in a remote place on the island with very, very little rain. Why stay in Kona or Hilo with the clouds? Stay in Waikoloa for the sun.The management team, Simon and David and Derrick (and I hope I forgot no one, sorry), really took care of my family and I.A week later my kids are already talking about next year's trip.If you are a family, and you want to spoil your kids for a week, here is where you MUST take them. Once again my high expectations were well exceeded. ", " We had a great time and noticed a real improvement in customer service and overall ability to help with anything we needed. Thanks again to the entire pool staff at the lagoon tower (Makai) for making our stay enjoyable. In no small part I would like to thank Crystal with Ocean sports. It was truly amazing the steps that she and her staff went through to make every part of our vacation perfect, you are lucky to have staff members like that who pay particular attention to all the needs of the guests. We are starting to schedule our next trip out for next year and will be bringing our entire family.ThanksBrad and Beth WardRoom 1311 ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village is the perfect hotel for families. The Dolphins are a highlight for the kids. There is large swimming pools and a lagoon, where you can paddle board. Beautiful Resort; without the cons. ", " Great service and beautiful hotel.. lots of swimming pools for all ages.. sitting areas nice and quiet space.. lots of places to explore.. train ride was great next trip stay longer.. Great day very clear and perfect kona weather.. ", " This resort is huge! They have trams or boats to get around, or it is a brisk 10 minute walk through a beautifully decorated covered path to the ocean tower. The lagoon tower is closer to the entrance. We stayed in the ocean tower and were lulled to sleep by the sound of birds singing. There are A LOT of birds that reside on the property that like to sing at night. Totally missed them after we left. Our room was clean and comfortable. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Our only complaint is that we didn't stay long enough! If you go, plan to spend some time at the resort and enjoy the property. ", " We stayed three nights at this Hilton in October; we previously stayed here 10 years ago during our last visit to the Big Island. For about $200 per night (plus resort fee, parking, and taxes), we had a premium ocean view. Walking around this huge property is enjoyable, as you pass one beautiful view or building after another. You could easily spend an entire day on the resort, and not want to leave. Food options were expensive (dinner for two usually was about $40 or $50 total, with no alcohol; an ice cream cone was $6). DVD rentals were free. We had a minor issue with our refrigerator (it was uneven, and items would roll out when you opened the door), and when we called it in, they came and replaced it. We had a great time, and would recommend this hotel to our friends. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is amazing. I took my wife for her surprise birthday weekend and we stayed in the Ocean Tower. The rooms and bed were comfortable with free wifi, room service, walk in closet, and an ocean view terrace. Adult pool, large pool, general store, Cantina restaurant, putt putt golf course and a coffee shop all within 2 minutes of our room. There is soo much to do on the resort you will never want to leave. I will be coming back for years to come. For the price you pay you could not ask for more. Sabrina in Grand Hilton Vacations is an angel!! Mahalo ", " This was an excellent resort and we enjoyed our stay. The employees were all friendly and extremely pleasant. The food was an 8 out of 10. The prices for beverages both alcoholic and non were on par for Hawaii prices. The rooms were excellent and the bed was very very comfy...Warning for those staying the Ocean Tower....Nightly Bird Meetings will result in a cacophony of bird noise. They meet again at about 3-4am. It didn't bother me but light sleepers beware. The hotel has complimentary ear plugs. The resort doesnt have its own sand beach to speak of, but there is a very nice public beach within a short walk or a few minutes drive. The resort has a tram service that runs constantly from the main lobby area to both remote locations of rooms. Its a large property with plenty of variation.It's is close to a grocery store and outdoor shopping bizarre with a wide variety of stores and restaurants. This was our first time in Hawaii so I cannot compare it any other property on the island. ", " We appreciated the professionalism of all the staff. We received courteous and prompt service. The location suited us perfectly! We thoroughly enjoyed this lovely resort hotel! We will recommend this hotel to our friends! ", " My wife and I celebrated our 40th Anniversary, my retirement, and my 65th birthday. This Hotel made our celebration truly wonderful. The staff was kind, caring and friendly. The food was wonderful. The pork tacos at the Boat Landing Casino are out of this world. The luau was something we will never forget. ", " Kona is quiet and charming. The Hotel itself is very cool. There is a large collection of Asian influenced art, all types, beautiful and impressive; great for a stroll every evening, you will see something new everytime, guaranteed. The pools are fun for guest of all ages. My favorite was the salt water lagoon for snorkeling and swimming. It's safe from sharks, which was important to me; Plus it contains many colorful fish and even turtles you swim right next to. I also enjoyed my room. The air-conditioner works like a charm. All in all I highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The team there is very hospitable and attentive as well and knowledgeable. ", " Another wonderful stay! We have been returning to the Waikoloa for over 20 years and just spent 4 nights in a lovely Makai cabana room in the Lagoon Tower. I have to say our desire to return is not only for the incredible island setting, it is also about the employees. It speaks volumes about the management when we see our favorite staff members again and again. Kerwin, the bartender at the Walolo Lounge is our definition of the consummate professional, mixing delicious drinks and engaging us in great baseball discussions. One of our past favorite memories was watching the 2012 World Series with him. Mialani is delightful and went out of her way to ensure that we were served promptly and with genuine hospitality in making sure we were comfortable. It was such a treat to see them both. Likewise, seeing Lawrence again at the Lagoon Grill bar was comforting. He mentioned that he has been with the property for over 20 years. We were not at all surprised when our excellent waiter, Brian at KPC, told us that he too had been with the Waikoloa for two decades. We were impressed with Samantha at the Hilton Honors check in desk. She texted us to make sure we were completely satisfied with our room. It was a nice touch! My husband and I are grateful for another exceptional visit and without hesitation highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa. Congrats on your fantastic team! ", " Recently spent 10 days at the Kona Waikoloa Hilton with my youngest son. We had a great time and were very impressed. It is a huge place! The room was nice. Very quiet. The grounds were immaculate and beautiful. My other son has already booked a stay there for next April. The parking fee was the only thing that I didn't agree with. Every thing else was super!!! ", " We been going here every two years of so, for 19 years. Is it still as good as it was, no. But what is, if you have kids and like the water, it can't be beat. Unless you have big bucks, you cant et here three meals a day. What we do, when we land and pick up our car, make a right and go to Kona and buy sullies. Everything is there on the left side streets, Walmart (bring you own bags, .50 per walmart bag) K-mart. Buy your coffee at Walmart, it cheap. If you leave the Hilton looking to eat someplace, the best is the ABC store. Outside the hotel area, Waikoloa town, (Turn left at the light, then your 1st right) has a cafe & subway. If you make the left t the light, a small village down the road about 15mins, a few small places to eat. Kona is your best bet, on the right side of the main road, very nice walking village, but just bout every day, a big boat comes in. Just so you know, this is big walking hotel, not great for the disabled. As a Hilton life time Diamond, I got a nice up great, with a door out the back, but could not be locked from the outside. ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikola every August three years in a row for Bike MS. The host is really amazing. You won't need to leave for anything. Service was amazing, they have delicious scented toiletries from the Kahala Spa. My fianc\u00e9 and I dined at the KPC, very pricy but it was voted one of the worlds most romantic restaurants. I loved the Kona Colada and make it at home now. Thanks for amazing memories! ", " We are always awed by this hotel's beauty, the landscaping and the artwork. It has everything; you really don't have to leave the property. But if you want to see other sights, they help you with a daily continental breakfast briefing. They have an excellent buffet breakfast with made to order omelets. It is a bit pricey but came with our package. They have dolphins on the property that you can interact with for a fee. I love to snorkel in their natural lagoon that has beautiful fish, eels, and turtles. The lagoon has a beach with water activities you can purchase. This property is enormous, so they have a boat or tram to take you to your room. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Sheldon of the valet staff and other valet members are welcoming every time you return and on leaving offer you water. I wouldn't recommend the luau, which I will review separately. ", " My husband and I went here in September to celebrate our anniversary. I was leery thinking that the island wouldn't have enough good beaches (like Maui) and wouldn't have enough to do, wrong, wrong wrong. This resort is amazing and just down the road is a great beach with snorkeling. We went through Costco for our hotel and car package and it also included two free buffet breakfasts every morning, a luau, resort fees and taxes. The breakfast buffet is great but it's $30 per person so to start your day off with that was perfect! The only item the package didn't include was the $25 a day parking fee. The lagoon was great to snorkel in (we brought our own gear, but you can rent it there). The pools are great and there are several slides. The biggest slide is by the waterfall that is built into the pool. There is also a section of the pool that has a sand bottom. It's only about 18 inches deep and great for small kids or just to sit in with your drink. The property is so large there is a tram and boat to take you back and forth. We used the tram each morning to get to the buffet and the boat at night (it starts service at 2 pm) to get to dinner at the Boat Landing Cantina (which has pretty good Mexican food and not too expensive) The tram and boat are free, you can use them even if you aren't staying there to look around the property or go eat. The only downside we had was when we checked-in the resort spent the first hour trying to up-sell us. They want to upgrade your room, upgrade your free seats at the Luau, things like that but once that is done they don't do it again. I never thought I would like Kona as much as Maui but this resort changed my mind. I can't wait to go back! I won't stay anywhere else! ", " Had an amazing time! Worth every penny, service was amazing and every time I come here I am more impressed. Spent most of our time at the pool, but really enjoyed the comfort of the room. Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be back. ", " Everything about this hotel is beautiful. The food the people the beaches the pools I cant say enough about. Goin with a family of 13 Hilton was very efficient friendly n accomodating. The only problem I had was leaving. ", " My children had a wonderful experience with our mini vacation. We were able to stay on property and use all of the facilities offered to us. My grandchildren enjoyed all the pools and slides too! It was an awesome weekend for my family and the memories your hotel gave to all of us will be remembered. Thank you! ", " This is a large Hilton property, which we really enjoyed. You can get to your room by boat or monorail. You could walk, but it is a very long walk. The drivers are very friendly. The service was great throughout the resort. We did the luau, which was great. While we were off the resort a lot, it was nice coming back at night to a place that was clean and comfortable. We had an ocean-view room in the Ocean Tower, which we both liked. If I ever return to Kona, I would stay here again. ", " I had such an excellent experience and im going back in April. The hotel was clean, the staff were extremely friendly. I order beautiful pictures from the complimentary photo shoot. I loved it!! I will be telling all my family and friends about the time I had there. ", " I'm writing this review from the perspective of a new young family with a baby. We absolutely loved staying at the Hilton Waikoloa village. It's sad to read so many negative reviews! It almost put us off staying here (we were tossing up between here and another hotel close by) but I'm so glad we did. Of course there are a few minor complaints (and I mean minor) but you are at a resort after all and its to be expected. That being said, I thought I would list all the pros and (small) cons, as well as some tips and then hopefully you can decide for yourself.Pros: + The location is beautiful and we were treated to a breathtaking sunset daily and gorgeous weather conditions!+ Several swimming pools and a lagoon to choose from, as well as a jacuzzi and a water slide (great for the young and not so young!)+ The property is set on 64 acres of lush grounds; there is a golf course, Putt putt, several shops, eateries, pool tables and free DVD hire so you really never have to leave!+ If you do decide to venture out, a shopping trolley will take you to local kings and queens shops for $2 each way p/p+ We found the room spacious and well equip, it comes with a mini refrigerator and our room had a couch, desk & chair, king bed, separate wash room & toilet/shower+ Very accommodating to families with kids, we requested a microwave and kettle on check in (to heat baby food etc) and it was waiting for us at our room+ Monorail and boat to rooms for those unable to walk long distances or for those who enjoy a relaxing ride!+ The onsite luau was amazing! A must do! Fabulous buffet selection of food and unlimited drinks! The best time Cons:- We found the expansive grounds difficult to navigate at times with a pram; whilst there are pram / wheelchair accessibility routes, they are longer and indirect so yes it does take a longer time to get where you want to go (but it's not impossible)- Yes, the restaurants and cafes are pricey. But you are on an island at a resort, so it's really to be expected. Probably the worst was sandwiches at the marketplace were $15 USD to make your own (about $20 Australian dollars!) - It does take a little while to walk anywhere on this resort. But that's what the monorail and boat are for! Okay they take a little while to arrive (one leaves around every 15mins) but you can always walk! People will complain either way. Tips:* To avoid costly meals, purchase sandwiches and salads etc from the queens market grocery shop and keep in your fridge* Request an in room microwave for reheating leftovers or for baby food etc* Ask for a kettle to boil water for baby* Be prepared to walk or wait! It's really not that bad. The grounds and facilities are well worth it* Have a wonderful time ", " Huge Hotel complex. Has a train. And a boat. Although you can walk, it's useful to use these to get around the hotel. We had a lovely trip on the boat to see the complex.There are lots of swimming pools in the hotel. It seems though that some people \"reserve\" the best spots early in the morning and then go for breakfast.We had a room in the Ocean Tower right on the Apex (I think 6010) looking out to the Ocean with a fantastic view. Make sure you work out the best way to walk around though. As a Hilton Gold, got a decent room. But onsite benefits extended mainly to a $10 a head credit and that was it. Still had to pay the resort fee.You could spend many days in this hotel, and never leave. The restaurants themselves were very nice. Had a late dinner in the Landing Boat Cantina when we arrived. ", " My wife and I stayed at this hotel 27 years ago on our honeymoon when it had first opened as the Hyatt. Since that time we have returned a few times, most recently in the past month. It is an amazing resort.I won't go into the details of the amenities available, since other reviewers have covered that extensively. What made the hotel special was the great service we received during our recent visit. We spent a week for our anniversary and throughout the resort, the staff knew we were visiting for our anniversary and went out of their way to do something special. At the hotel restaurants we were often offered complimentary desserts even though we had not mentioned anything about our anniversary to the restaurant.When we returned to our room the actual day of our anniversary, \"Happy Anniversary\" was written in small stones on our bed, and two towels were converted into beautiful swans. We took advantage of an \"all inclusive\" offer I had received by email. This included daily breakfast, 3 course dinners in the hotel restaurants, and all the drinks we wanted throughout the day. It was an amazing bargain which allowed us to visit any of the restaurants on the property, start our days with tropical drinks by the pool, and have great meals. This all inclusive rate also included the dreaded \"resort fee\" and the daily parking fee. It was one of the best travel bargains I had in a long time.We stayed in a Makai one bedroom suite, which was a fantastic room, with a direct ocean view. We woke up every morning to sunrise over the ocean.I can't recommend this hotel enough if you want a wonderful Hawaiian relaxing vacation. And the all inclusive rate made it a travel bargain. ", " Trams and boat within the hotels to take you from hotel to hotel. great lagoon to swim, paddleboard, paddleboat or just snorkel with the fish. The pools and waterslides are fun for all! not your typical water park. ", " We normally dont stay at large resorts when we travel, but adult daughter travelling with us wanted to use some of her Hilton points. We really did not make use of the available facilities. That said, it was a beautiful property. Lots of pools, ponds, landscaping, statuary,etc. We were in a 9th floor one bedroom unit in the Ocean tower. The room and beds were very nice with living room and bedroom opening onto the lanai. Hilton is noted for their beds and they were very comfy. The Ocean Tower is the building farthest from the lobby. They have trams that run quite frequently - it is a bit of a hike to walk to the entry area where you have go to pick up your valet delivered car. Self parking (another hike) or valet parking is not included in the resort fee. I think these sorts of large resorts are best suited to people who go there and stay there for their activities not for folks who leave the resort each day for their activities.We did enjoy an early morning hike around the grounds each day. There are lots of feral cats on the propery. The Hilton info says they trap and neuter the animals and give them veterinary care. We also saw lots of mongoose. They were imported to Hawaii to kill the accidentally imported rats. Unfortunately one is nocturnal and the other is diurnal. So the two never met. So much for the mammal lesson! Go for the resort experience, if that is your thing. wi-fi free for Hilton gold or better members. ", " This is an amazing and huge resort. Stay at the Ocean Tower if you want an adult only pool, or Oceanside cabanas. It's also a mile walk from one end to the other, but there is a boat or tram to take around the property. The spa and fitness center is very nice. The staff are all wonderful Jessica at the front desk checked us in and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great \"welcome\". The cabanas out near Buddha Point is the spot to be for peace and quiet, and beautiful views. Jez and Brandan are super friendly and helpful out that way and at the Kohala Pool. We come back year after year and it is the highlight of our Hawaiian vacation. ", " Go and be amazed by the hotel that was the most expensive to build in the world at one stage and the island of Hawaii, 5 of world 7 climates. The contrast between each climate including snow and beaches, the snorkeling is fantastic ", " I was impressed by the Customer Service at this Hilton Hotel. The Hotel is well maintained and the design of the rooms is very comfortable for a long stay. All Inclusive provided a very good value for the money. ", " My wife, son, and I just returned from an excellent four night stay. (recently on Oahu, we've been dodging hurricanes and the weather on the Kohala coast was probably the best in the state.)The large room we stayed in at the Ocean tower had a very pretty ocean view. (see photo) This particular section seems to have been recently renovated. We much appreciated the large walk-in closet as we brought our SCUBA gear over from Honolulu. The first night, the air-conditioner was not really cooling. I gave the building concierge a call and he had two really nice local guys from Engineering come to our room very quickly. They changed the motor in about 20 minutes and everything was fine afterwards.Unlike hotels in places like Waikiki, Waikoloa has the luxury of building out instead of up. There are trams and motor launches to move guests from one end of the property to the other. These were very convenient. The morning jog around the property is about 2.5 miles; it's pretty extensive.We have some familiarity with the Big Island. My wife and I have completed several Kona Ironman races, she is a new principal mentor and travels to Hilo and we took the around-the-islands cruise in March. There is so much to see if you are fond of nature. There's not much of a club-scene in Waikoloa. It's out in the \"country\".We found the staff at the Waikoloa Hilton to be very friendly and welcoming. Whenever we had a question, the answers were right there. Though we are a \"haole\" family, when the staff found out that we are from Mililani, they bent over backwards to make sure we had a great visit.The Waikoloa area has some of the nicest SCUBA diving in the state. The reefs are much healthier than Oahu's though you can see a little bleaching from the temperature increase. The water temperature according to my computer was about 83F at 70 feet. There are many dive companies in the area and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome. (My son and I did a two-tank boat dive and at the end of the dives we broke down and packed our gear. The dive master said \"Awww! we were going to wash your gear for you.) (See my reviews of Blue Wilderness in Waikoloa/Puako and Kona Diving Co. in Kailua, Kona. The Manta dives are just incredible.I must say at this point that we are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members and have been using our points and benefits to great advantage this year. My wife booked this trip in conjunction with several promotions. Great room rates, $200 voucher, free car and various other trinkets in exchange for a 2 hour presentation. We let the people know that we are already owners and would not be purchasing anything right now. They were very friendly and took us around to see the amenities and the units in King's Village which were very impressive. At this point, the Manager said \"Could I interest you in 7000 points for $1695?\" We jumped at the opportunity. We are using the points to book a lovely two bedroom unit with full kitchen, dining room, view, etc. for seven days in June. Chris and I are already planning our dives, Carol would like to do the Manta dive again. The unit sleeps six comfortably so we're telling various family members to fly over and stay for a couple of days.A couple of tips: Everything on the Big Island is more expensive than Oahu which is twice as expensive as say, Ogden, Utah. The markets in King's and Queen's Village are less expensive than the hotel. If you really want to save some money on food and sundries, drive back out to the Queen K Hwy., turn left, take the next right and drive five miles up the hill to the Waikoloa Village shopping center. Keep an eye out for the goats grazing by the side of the road. There's a KTA store in the center where the prices are a little higher than Oahu. They sell great steaks that I'm guessing might come from the Parker Ranch.One of the secrets of traveling anywhere in Hawaii is to relax, get to know the local people, tell them a little about yourself and ask questions that show respect for them and their home. (Yelling at a service worker might get things done faster on W. 57th St. in NYC but it's not going to work here. I watched a couple of tourists in Kailua-Kona get all \"da kine\" with people who were trying to help them and I just felt embarrassed. It's all good. Relax and enjoy.In response to the comment about the pool and lagoon temperatures. (I'm a swimmer, diver, triathlete) I thought they were perfect mid to high 70s. Refreshing when you jump in great once you start swimming.I've recently retired so I have the ability to travel during the \"shoulder\" periods. Currently on Oahu, hotel occupancy is nearly 90% but on the Big Island, it's about 59%. If you can travel when it's not winter break, spring break, or summer, I encourage you to do so. You can call and talk to hotel people. They know when the best times are. We never felt crowded or overwhelmed by visitors during our stay. ", " I went to the Big Island of Hawaii three years ago in May 2012. I loved that hotel! It was a nice and open. They have like three pools and I actually swim in the pool with the water slide all day! There are also many restaurants including a chinese food place! You need to stay at this hotel if you plan on going to the Big Island of Hawaii! ", " This hotel has so many things going for it.... Beautiful pools including one with a waterfall, great sunsets and an amazing collection of art. The art is located all along the walkways between the different buildings. It's worth skipping the tram that moves you around the complex and walk to see it all. ", " You have to see this place to believe it, it's mammoth size and pristine condition seem insignificant to what else is on offer here. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the hidden charges, but that seems to be the norm over here in the US. We stayed for our honeymoon, was a bit gutted we didn't get an upgrade as the place wasn't exactly full but we enjoyed it never the less. The birds can be very very loud at night but ear plugs fix this no problem at all. The picture shows the size of a tennis court for a size comparison. ", " We were at the Hilton Waikoloa in September of 2011 and my review here on TripAdvisor states we'll be back. Well, we went back and our experience was equally as good. Great customer service!This trip, we were in the Ocean Tower which is the furthest away from the lobby. There is a train that will take you back and forth and it runs quite frequently. You also have the option to take a boat ride down their man-made river.Our room was lovely and as booked, overlooking the ocean to beautiful sunsets. Except for a slightly beat-up cabinet that held our fridge, the room was free of signs of aging. It was immaculately clean and the bed induced a coma-like sleep every night. Of note, the cleaning staff at this resort are just exceptional. We keep our room very tidy but every time they came in, I felt like we were coming into a brand new room each time.There are so many amenities at this resort, particularly the gorgeous swimming pools and restaurants. Even the small bar at the end of the train for the Ocean Towers provided me with one of the best pina coladas I have ever tasted.Nearby are two shopping village where you can buy provisions for the room or even grab sandwiches, salads or sushi for dinner. There is a small Macy's and other clothing stores in addition to a Tiffany's should you decide to really indulge.This is a great base to take in all of the fantastic things to do in the area. It's remote but easy to travel from going north, south and east. The only tiny negative is the cost for self-parking. $25 per day is steep.Overall, great experience again! ", " Our first visit to Hawaii, and the Waikoloa Village resort was outstanding. We visited in late September, between the summer rush and winter high season, and found a very large, well appointed resort, suitable for families and couples. Green sea turtles were frequent visitors to the large saltwater lagoon, along with numerous other colorful fish, which made the sheltered water even more of an adventure. Paddleboards and snorkel gear were available, and the sandy beach was great for kids. If that got boring, there were several pools as well. The large comfortable, deluxe oceanview room on the sixth floor of the Lagoon Tower did not disappoint, and looked out over the golf course to the ocean beyond, and to North Kohala. Other reviewers have commented on the loud nesting birds, with peak noise at twilight and then again just before dawn, but easy to ignore. We also appreciated the convenient coffee shop, friendly attentive staff, and the tram for when the walk back to the tower is too long. A wonderful stay, and we are starting to plan our return. ", " This is a wonderful resort. The hotel complex is large, but is easy to navigate via monorail and walking. There are many activities to keep busy with. The food is good, but a little pricey, but remember this is Hawaii. There is plenty of shopping close by the complex. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. We had a great week here. ", " This resort has the most lovely grounds and amenities. One of the best things is the protected lagoon where you can swim and snorkel and see loads of tropical fish and even sea turtles (I saw two!). I am not the strongest swimmer, and it was a joy for me to be in a safe, contained environment where I could snorkel. I would not have been nearly as comfortable if I'd had to worry about being in the open ocean. There is a Dophin Quest here, and our room faced the pools where the Dolphins were trained. It was lovely to see the dolphins...they are so happy and enjoy the attention they get from the small army of trainers that work with them. The main pool for people has a super-fun long slide and the pool itself is spacious and a great place to hang out. Other nice amenities are the train and the boats that can carry you from one end of the resort to the other. I like to go to a worship service when I'm on vacation.....they have a lovely small chapel facing the ocean where the service was conducted. The service was meaningful and educational, and the leaders were gracious and welcoming. ", " This was a fun resort to stay at. We had a ocean view room which was absolutely beautiful. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. The grounds were spacious and immaculate. There are 2 modes of transportation around the resort. 1 is by air conditioned tram and the other is by small canal boats. This was a really fun place to stay. ", " We always come back here. An incredible property with 60+ acres. A tram or Venetian Water Taxi takes you to one of three towers. Live dolphin training for kids. Beautiful grounds. The beach is rocky, but a Huge lagoon with a beach and water toys, kayaking, etc. One of the best Luau's we have even seen. It very Hawaiian and does not try to cover all the Pacific Islands. Golf, miniature golf, three pool areas with slides, many dining selections. Waterfall with a cave and swim up hot tub. ", " We have been staying at the Hilton Waikoloa 1-2 times a year for many years. We travel often, but consider this hotel our \"second home\". The entire staff including those in upper management are the best. The grounds are beautiful, the food and service excellent.. be sure to try out the restaurants at the Hotel. The rooms pretty & beds comfortable. Kids & Family will love the dolphins and the Lagoon. We think of everyone at this Hotel as our Hawaiian ohana(family). Make this your next vacation spot. You will never want to leave!!! ", " Fun in the sun and the property was excellent. upgraded to the Lagoon Tower and the Makai amenities were worth the cost. Food was expensive at the resort and the food service was not as good as expected. All the resort facilities were excellent and an oceanfront room is recommended. ", " Enjoyed all the amenities they had to offer. Loved the Dolphin Quest. Wonderful place for families to enjoy. It was so beautiful everywhere you were. So much to see and the service was great.Had the pleasure of staying there while looking for a house. Found one. ", " This place is very fun and good for family, there are many activities your children can do and for yourself as well. I recommend this place, 10/10, this place contains shopping areas, restraints, etc. I absolutely love this place! ", " I arrived here on Saturday and am not looking forward to leaving on Wednesday!This has to be the best resort in the US that I have visited and had opportunity to stay at. What I enjoyed about it the most was having options to eat at throughout the resort and not all located within a set building as you'd find in other places. The rooms are large (500sqf/40sqm). All the facilities you would need and more that you can request in a hotel room. The grounds have their own dolphin lagoon with resident dolphins, 2 sharks in their own enclosure, and a lagoon for snorkelling as well as a pool that would satisfy the fussiest of guests! Plus enough lounge chairs to accommodate a full house!I stayed in the Lagoon tower, in a Makai room so this came with extra benefits only dedicated to the Makai room guests, but each tower has it's benefits and it's own unique views. I would have to say that over 50% of the rooms have full or partial ocean views too. Now the staff, these guys are just awesome! Nicholas at the front desk was a pleasure and really informative. Then Eric who took me to my room and made sure I was explained where things were located and what there was to do onsite was great as well. This was truly a unique experience and I'm glad that I made this decision to stay here for my first Hawaii adventure. ", " We previously stayed at the Hilton Waikiki in Honolulu for 3 nights before coming to the big island. This resort is by far superior. We knew it the minute we checked in that we would like this one better. Frank at the front desk was very friendly and memorable. I personally love the text feature to the staff to answer any questions or address any issues as we used it many times for questions and to get additional laundry services. Kelli, Emily, and Angie were all helpful via the txt every time we had questions no matter where we were in the resort or out. I did not know that we were restricted to only 3 devices via wifi but wasn't a big deal once we knew. The food at the Boat Landing and Pizza (tony/donna piazza?) was great. As everyone says, the dining can be expesnive but everything on the islands was more than home as expected, we stuck to the cheaper places when we could. The snorkeling in the lagoon was much better than expected and we saw more there than we did on Oahu on our trips we drove to go snorkeling. The water was weird being the mix of fresh/salt at times creating a haze but the amount/variety of fish was amazing. As mentioned there is no \"true beach\" at the resort and would have to drive to go see them but wasn't an issue for us, the lagoon was nice. We are a couple and there were many kids in pool but also saw many without anyone in them and an adult pool. We stayed in the Ocean Tower which was the furthest from everything and the walk/tram/boats were not a problem. we did each at various times without issue, just expect it to take 10-20 minutes to get across resort no matter the method (walking is about as fast vs waiting on others but wasn't an issue for us in either case). The resort fee and parking fee is a bit annoying as I would rather have it all included upfront but every hotel on both islands did this so not a complaint against this one, just plan accordingly. We found the whole island to be great and much better destination than others. the hotel was very accommodating and eager for feedback during the entire stay (I have never felt like my opinion mattered as much during a stay before). I have no real complaints as it was overall a great time. My wife and I have both said that if/when we return to Hawaii, this will be the destination. ", " This is a wonderful place for the whole family. Once you enter the lobby a monorail type train transports you to the vast resort. From swimming with the dolphins to just relaxing in the lagoon, we love this Hilton property. ", " Massive Hotel with great amenities. We stayed in the section right near the Reception so the size of the resort didn't bother us. The room was lovely and clean and the grounds were very well kept.I loved swimming with the wild turtles in the lagoon, it was amazing. ", " An excellent family resort that affords the children access to swim in the bay with turtles or a beautiful pool with slides and a waterfall. Many restaurants and shops close by 8 pm so plan accordingly. ", " First thing to realize that this is very large resort and takes a long time to get to around. You have to build in extra time to get anywhere on time.The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. The pools were excellent with plenty of room to spread out and have a great time. We had a room with an ocean view that was spectacular. ", " The resort is absolutely beautiful. Was there on vacation with my daughters and we loved it. Very family friendly. Club Keiki is wonderful for children, the staff is really great. The restaurants within the resort are great, good food and excellent service. The resort is clean. Rooms could use a little upgrading but they're not awful. Great pools and lots of activities at your fingertips. You will never run out of fun things to do. Will definitely stay there again. ", " I have never been to a hotel like this before. it is truely amazing. its like freaking disney world. its so huge! they have a big fancy tram that runs through it to take you around! they have multiple buildings and numerous pools. multiple restaurants and bars. too many pools to count. and amazing grotto pool area with 2 hot tubs and multple water falls. water slides. spa. shopping...im just getting started. they have the most amazing pool/beach thing i have ever seen. its like a giant pool, but its made of sand and ocean water. it it blocked off from the open ocean, so there are no waves, but they ocean water including sealife flows in! you stroll into the \"pool\" and there are fish and turtles and everything all right there in a protected area! you can snorkel, kayak, stand up paddle board, paddle boat, etc. all right there. have i mentioned the dolphins! they have dolphins! like 20 of them! and you can swim with them! (for an insanely high price), but i recommend just watching them! they have sharks too! they have a few little boats that go around a river too! the only thing is that the food and drinks are pricey. we went down to the shops and ate our meals and boat our alcohol there! i recommend doing that! and we got a great kamaaina discount! (if you dont know what kamaaina is, you dont qualify for it, hawaii residents only) highly highly recommend this place! ", " Spent a long weekend at Hilton Waikoloa. This was my third time staying at this resort...so it is someplace that I would recommend. It is great for couples, and families. So much to do while on property or close by that you wouldn't really need to leave the resort area if you have already done a lot of site seeing on the Big Island. They have three towers, Lagoon, Ocean and Palace tower as well as a convention center...a number of restaurants, a few pools, a salt water lagoon that opens up to the ocean...Dolphin Quest that you can participate in or just watch. Staff were always very friendly and courteous. Wanted to do Stand Up Paddle board the day before leaving but when inquired they said they had shut it down for the day due to some winds. When I inquired about what time they opened to try again before my flight, when they heard it was last day there they opened it up to let me go ahead and take a board out. That was greatly appreciated and I really enjoyed SUP in the lagoon looking at the fish and the turtles. The is no waves so for beginners it is great but for anyone it is fun and relaxing. For those into golf there is a course there, I saw tennis courts as well. I used the gym one morning and while small, there was more than enough cardio machines in one room and they had a room for weight training as well.Being that it was after Labor day weekend and a lot of kids back in school it was not as crowded and made for a very relaxing weekend. ", " This is our 2nd time to this property, both times for a company award trip. Large property, I said its \"disney-ish\" with the tram and neatly manicured grounds, and then I learned it was developed by same group that developed some Disney properties. There is plenty to do, in the lagoon, restaurants, but if you want real ocean beach where you can lie in the sand by ocean, you have to go off property. (There are beaches close by.) Staff is helpful, ocean view room was great. Food is pricey but good. (Most of ours was catered and included in our company function, and was great, so not an issue for us). ", " Absolutely beautiful resort with excellent service. We stayed for 8 days in a Makai room in Lagoon Tower, so my review is based on that experience. Our room overlooked both the ocean and dolphin area which was exactly what we asked for when making our reservation. Days were spent snorkeling in the lagoon or swimming in the pool. Valet service was very prompt, with our longest wait for our car being around five minutes during which was very obviously a peak check in/check out time. Only thing that could have made our trip better is a more varied selection of restaurants. We loved Imari, the Japanese restaurant, but it was closed on Sunday and Monday which seemed odd for a resort restaurant. The \"nice\" restaurant, KPC, had above average food but the view and service were top notch. We spent our last day in what they refer to as a \"luxury cabana\". The price was very reasonable and the service, again, was amazing. It was the perfect ending to a perfect week, spending it relaxing and looking out over the ocean.Our family can't wait to return and I'm going to request that very same room again. Truly a great property with great staff. ", " Stayed in the Ocean Tower this weekend. Room was one the 3rd floor, far from elevator and tram, but closer to small pool. The service was excellent! The hotel activities and poolls were great and relaxing. Only low point was the hotel was booked up and very busy this past weekend! If you want the hotel to yourself, you gotta come during the week days, when it's slower due to school starting, so less kids and families. I loved it , it was very relaxing swimming everyday and the weather was beautiful! ", " Beatiful hotel, a lot of activities around to participate in. It is a little bit far away from an organised city. Car rental is definetely required to view the rest of the place. Very clean place with all the ranges of food prices ", " Huge hotel, great for families with kids. Several pools, a monorail (great if you have a train obsessed kid), boats around the property. Food good, pricy as you would expect ($30 hot buffet breakfast). Lagoon is excellent for snorkeling, saw lots of fish, turtles and eels. ", " The area for miles around the resort is full of black volcanic rock and the resort itself is set beautifully with an abundance of lush greenery interlaced with volcanic rocks, almost as if it is a decoration giving it a surreal feel to it. As a result, the hot sun was radiating heat during the day, but very cool as the sun started going down. The resort units were very well equipped and furnished, with a great sit-out verandah amidst the strong breeze that gave a feel of a rugged forest setting. ", " This resort is perfect for families with children of all ages. Cute shopping center near the resort that has restaurants and a small resort Macy's to pick up things you may have forgotten.The restaurants are a little pricey, it is nice to have a subway and dairy queen down the street, that can be accessed through a trolley or walking. The hotel next to the Hilton has a big beach that is not private, you can walk along the shoreline from the Hilton to the beach in front of the Marriott.They have two pools at the Hilton, one has a big water slide and a small sandy pool for babies. You can also swim with the dolphins there. Take a monorail or a boat to your room.It is fun there. ", " The hotel needs to description. You will see how beautiful this hotel is once you arrive. The facility, the grounds, the accommodations are wonderfuly but what really makes this place feel so welcoming is the friendly staff. From the bell desk, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, maintenance, restaurant staff, pool staff, EVERYONE was so friendly. They definitely make me want to go back for more! Thank you Hilton Waikoloa! ", " Firstly you definitely need a car as this resort is 35 minutes north of the airport and Kona is some kilometers south of the airport. Once inside the resort (it's not easy to locate on the first trip) you will find it hard to leave. The grounds and facilities are second to none. Some reviews said to stay away from the Ocean Tower as it is close to the ocean but away from the main pools etc - this maybe true for people travelling with families but there is less noise from kids and we still managed to walk to the far side when we could be bothered waiting for the train (runs every 10mins or so until 10pm). Anything to do with the dolphins is expensive but we managed to swim with the turtles that come into the resorts open to ocean swimming bay for free. If you can get a breakfast included deal it is worth while. If you don't eat much breakfast you can get side sevings such as toast/egg/sausage/breakfast potatoes etc generally a little cheaper than paying for the buffet. As I said it is hard to leave the resort but make sure you get out and explore the island ", " This resort was absolutely beautiful and there were so many things to do. The restaurants were wonderful with no waiting. The golf courses were gorgeous and challenging. This resort is one that we will visit again. ", " Excellent resort, service and restaurantsAmazing pools and locationTook 3 days just to see this resortUpgraded to ocean front room due to 25 th anniversaryHope to return to itRooms a little dated but comfortable ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is wonderful!! My stay was absolutely relaxing and I didn't have to leave the resort area if I didn't want too! Everything I needed was at my finger tips. The staff is professional and friendly. They even sent me a text to check on me during my stay. They go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Recommendations - valet cause the self parking is a journey! I do hope they make the tram faster because while the resort is massive and the tram is surely needed, I walked and got to my destinations faster!Clean and breathtaking grounds, clean and comfy room!Highly recommend you stay for family, couples or solo :0) ", " Wonderful friendly staff . Beautiful room and bath room . Nice linen. Safe location . Very clean . Pools comfortable. Nice poolside restaurant for lunch . Plenty of shade opportunities . Water slides fun. ", " The grounds are so beautiful and we loved our room. Between all the pools and the lagoon, we were always doing something fun. Food is great too! For kids and adults, there is so much to do. You can rent a paddle boat on the lagoon or pick from several pools. There are slides at several of the pools. We LOVE this place and come back every year! Best place anywhere! ", " Very nice resort and had everything you need. Great family atmosphere. My husband and i will bring the family along with the grandchildren next time. The pools were awesome and you had a choice of lagoon or regular. ", " Room located on the 3rd floor with an ocean view. Large space with nice bathroom and living space.. The concierge, Frank, was very helpful and made checking in very easy. Entire hotel staff was very gracious and courteous. The hotel and quite large and the grounds are extensive and very beautiful. We ate at 3 different restaurants, two of them being Big Island Breakfast and Kamuela Provision Company. The latter was a romantic dinner outside on a bluff above the Pacific. Food and service in all 3 restaurants was very good with the wait staff being quite attentive. ", " Great welcome. Several pool options. Right on the beach. Not very crowded. Even the airline staff stay here when they have flights here. Large resort. So you may do some walking. Several beach options and activities. ", " The Hilton is quite large, but easy to navigate and a very welcoming place. I stayed in the Lagoon tower, which is very near a great pool and the spa. Fantastic dining options and on site tour booking provide great convenience. Also near shopping at Queens Marketplace and Kings Shops. ", " Such a great experience! It is beautiful and a world to itself. Our family loved the alternative ways of getting around the property - including by boat. It was unique. It is upscale and you could go to the Big Island and never leave this resort, but you should because there is a lot to see and do there, but what a terrific place to come \"home\" to at the end of each day. We even went to the Luau. Going to a hotel luau in Hawaii is a little bit cheesy, but it was fun too. ", " booked a 4 day stay at this hotel with my family of 5, just awsome!..the property is just huge...air conditioned train to our building was great since it was unbearably hot and humid, we had one of the spacious suites overlooking the dolphine lagoon and beach area, my kids loved the free boat rides also between buildings, but especially loved the main pool with it's multiple hot tubs,waterfalls, kids sand play area and especially the water slide..i enjoyed the ocean with its wide variety of sealife to see and areas to explore in safety (you can snorkle around a waterfall and the giant pillars that make up the main entrance, to the outer bay). we chose not to dine in house as we decided to visit the recommended shops in kailua-kona town and waimea which was more affordable for our family and we could at the same time get great goodies for our return home. the unlimited dvd and game rentals were also great at night to keep the family happy.. the staff was very helpfull and nice.  their was only one thing we found that wasn't really a problem...there was no microwave in our room but we didn't call to see if we could have rented one.  as a local born resident i highly recommend this hotel for local people...the price is justifiable for what your getting and will return for another stay. ", " Actually I didn't go there for vacation, but for a conference, so my expectation might be lower than a vacationer. But still, I would recommend this place. It's a large resort, several buildings, and we even need to take a little train from the conference hall to our room. The people are nice and helpful. The see view is great, but I don't think they have real sea beaches. There are mostly rocks. But they have some lakes/pools that people do snorkeling and stand up paddle boarding. ", " I brought my son to Hilton Waikoloa Village in August. It's a fantastic 62-acre resort that is more like a theme park than any other resort we stayed at. There are three towers with hotel rooms and suites, plus many other buildings for restaurants, conference halls, etc. Don't worry. At check-in, you will be given a resort map. There is a Monorail-like train that carries you to different locations in the resort. The train runs from 6:00am to midnight. If you have leisure time, you can also take a boat that travels along a canal and stops at many different locations. The boat runs from 2:00pm to 10:00pm. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, facing the dolphin pool. There is a huge swimming pool with waterfalls and a slide behind the Lagoon Tower. (On a previous trip we stayed at Ocean Tower, which is opposite of the Lagoon Tower and has a narrower pool.) There is also a lagoon where you can rent a kayak or water bike or other water activities. There is a small sandy beach by the lagoon, but there is no ocean-facing beach at the resort. (Big Island has few sandy beaches. There is a public sand beach outside the resort, in the Waikoloa area, with free public parking.) The only \"complaint\"? The resort is too big. It takes a while to get from Point A to Point B. If you have a dinner reservation, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get there (walking, by train, or by boat). ", " This is a gigantic, sprawling resort. There are numerous towers of rooms connected by 'Disney-esque' monorail or a trip on a boat. There are pools for adults and children. Waterslides, waterfalls, swim with dolphins...There is everything you could desire and it's all at the edge of the ocean. There are numerous eating and drinking options. You are also close to shops and other eateries. Whilst I did not stay here, so I cannot comment on the rooms (though I'd be surprised if they were not fine) I was at the neighbouring Hilton Grand Vactions Club resort, I could not imagine families, couples or even single travellers not having fun here. ", " This large hotel has a little bit of everything. We typically avoid big resort hotels, but this place is just too much fun for the kids. The pools are fantastic, my daughter couldn't get enough. The lagoon was also quite fun for her, there were fish and sea turtles everywhere. There really isn't a beach at the hotel, but a short walk from the KPC restaurant on site will take you to A-Bay beach, great for small kids. Don't forget footwear for the walk as there is a considerable amount of coral and rocks on the trail. The dolphin pool on site is a big draw, you can watch them at any time from up close and personal. Strolling the grounds was a pleasure, there is plenty of natural beauty in addition to an unusually large amount of artwork.The downside to this hotel is mostly a function of its size. It takes some time to get around and to get off-site. ", " We stayed here a couple months ago - just got back from another vacation and finally have a chance to talk about the wonderful experience!We visited the big island in MAY, and there was a production going on during the same time.No idea what it was, but it was with kids running around trying to find things.Let me tell you - the ENTIRE CREW was so accommodating and friendly!We asked what the production was, they explained to us what was going on, and even let us stand around to watch the action!How amazing!!The hotel also has amazing food and the scenery is great.A bit overpriced for what you get, but hey - it's Hawaii!I ate at the Japanese restaurant and our server made sure that I had an entirely gluten free meal to eat!Before I arrived, I found online a menu of all the restaurants and the gluten free choices they offer.Brilliant!The spa was nice as well - not a lot of people so it was quiet.A great resort to relax and get away from it all.The parking fee of $25 was also a bit steep, but hey - it's HAWAII!Mahalo! ", " I just returned from a conference that was held at this resort in late August. I've never attended a professional event in such an expansive setting, and I doubt I've ever been in such a large resort for leisure either. It says something that the lion's share of rooms are in a set of towers that are several minutes away by tram from the registration area! Because it was hot and the trams only run so often, I usually wound up walking between the conference and my room. Not a bad walk at all, but sometimes I wish there were an air-conditioned alternative other than the tram. There's also a boat that runs from mid-afternoon into the evening, along the same route. I did that one time, and got a better view of the rest of the resort. Quite spectacular scenery, including waterfalls. Because I was only there for the conference, I didn't really get to partake in leisure activities -- for the brief time I had afterwards, I did a day trip to the volcano and saw a coffee grower. So I wish I'd had time for the lagoon, the beach, the spa, etc. I really can't wait to go back with family for a true vacation. My room was quite large (king bed, sofa, nice big sink, walk-in closet, etc. Only catch to it was the plumbing being a bit noisy (gurgled sometimes), but that wasn't bad enough for me to worry about reporting until I left. Other than the catered events, which were quite good, I didn't eat on-site except for the Sunday brunch. It was a bit crowded but not unreasonably so. And the price was actually surprisingly low given the overall meal prices I'd seen at some of the resorts (about $30 for a huge spread). ", " we had no expectations, so it was easy to wow us with this resort. great pools, a tidal pool to snorkel, dolphins to swim with, wonderful views, lots of amenities. this is a BIG resort, but they manage it extremely well. 2 small issues during the stay, both resolved immediately by great staff. ", " We have stayed here more than once and consider this to be one of our favorite places to go! The boats that take you to your room couldn't be a better way to start off your honeymoon or romantic getaway with your spouse! We will definitely go back again and again.. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are well kept and the staff is friendly and helpful. The lagoon boasts some of the best snorkeling on the island, in a protected environment. Turtles and fish abound- some of the largest mullets and parrot fish I have ever seen! Bring your own snorkle gear or rent from the Ocean Sports stand. The pools are also well maintained and beautiful. If you are traveling with children, they will LOVE the Hilton. Tip: rent a cabana if you plan to spend the whole day at either the lagoon or any of the pools. The sun is very strong and the cabana will provide you with an entire day of sun protection as well as being served ice cold water and towels and a private host from the bar/restaurant. Reserve the day before, because they go fast! Go up to Buddha point to watch the sunset and then take in a great meal at any of the onsite restaurants or venture out to the King or Queens Shops a short distance away to enjoy a gourmet meal, economical food court or a very nice grocery store at the Queens Shops that sells prepared food as well as any staples you may require. There is a free shuttle that runs regularly between the hotel and the shops. I have stayed at almost every resort in Waikoloa and Kailua Kona, and the Hilton Waikoloa is the best! ", " Third time staying at this resort....and I'll keep coming back.From the moment you walk into the resort lobby, it's only a few more steps to stand at the top of 'Grand Staircase' where you will gaze at a breathtaking view of the grand pillars leading down to a waterfall as well as a panoramic view of the resort.The massive resort itself is adorned with many pools, ponds, lagoons, artwork....and even the natural resort beach surrounding the property is gorgeous. There's not many places to go where there isn't something pleasant to look at. The resort has multiple restaurants to choose from, a dolphin lagoon, several bars, a gym, a spa and even a whole tennis center.....not to mention the in-house monorail and boat to take you around the resort. But even if you take the walking option, every path within the resort has a scenic view of something so it's definitely worth taking some time for a walk around the resort day or night......at night is better it want some quiet alone time if travelling as a couple ;)Have stayed in the Palace Tower previously but much prefer the Ocean Tower. I always end up in an Ocean Tower suite on the perfect side which gives a great balance between a view of the ocean as well as the rest of the resort with Mauna Kea towering in the distance.This is also one of the rare places in the world that makes a 'Kona Colada'......an absolutely amazing (alcoholic) drink that is a must try at least once! ", " My husband and I, and our daughter, and grand daughter stayed at Koloa Suites at Hilton Waikoloa Village. It is lovely, and very well kept. I would highly recommend staying here. We were able to use the pool at the Waikoloa Beach Hotel, which is beautiful! We went to the Luau, which was very nice. The show was excellent, and the food, OK. There is a shuttle to take you to the hotel, or shopping. We love it here, and would definitely return. ", " We were previously staying at the Marriott in Waikoloa village which is 2 minutes away from the Hilton but the Marriott had NOTHING on the Hilton. The Hilton was HUGE. It felt like an Asian palace. It has over 5 different type of restaurants inside and a beautiful pool and lagoon area with beautiful views and waterfalls. The view was PHENOMENAL. Everything was so peaceful! Honestly worth the money and worth the stay! ", " Very nice. Perfect for family. The water slides and the kids friendly beach and snorkeling with a lot of turtles.You will get to see dolphins and turtles for sure. The pool with lazy river are awesome.Got upgraded to ocean view with dolphin quest view in the lagoon tower. Very friendly staff. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa made us as kamaaina feel as important as the out-of-town guests. In all situations we also received kamaaina discounts. We love the facility and the staff is the best. We highly recommend to locals who are looking for a staycation. ", " very impressed with this resort. it is very family friendly specially with kids. it has many amenities kids would love. you don't have to leave the resort as there are so many things to do within resort. nice location. ", " What i liked most of this hotel was is was in Hawaii and free :) This is resort is large and interesting with several nice pools. It was full but never felt like it . In 5 days I still didn't see all. we left wanting to return to try more of it out. Its at a great location for our needs .. we needed snorkeling and to find restaurants, supermarket and gas station all close. The art and sculptures at the resort were magnificent. I greatly enjoyed strolling around looking at things to see what art and wildlife I could find. We were thrilled to have enough rewards points for free 5 night stay and that included the resort fees. there are several restaurants at the resort which was convenient. do have to pay for parking but didn't need to valet .. always found a spot open and found short cut through the spa to our part of the resort via the parking lot (would depend on which building your room was at). The have protected lagoon which is good for children to do water sports and snorkeling, Their lagoon and beach wasntt what we prefer to snorkel or swim at. We left the resort for snorkeling and beach .. but did use the pools there. They have Dolphin area you can pay to have dolphin encounter. but I did watch the dolphins .. made me a little sad they weren't free. .  There is alot of paved area ... I assume ok for wheelchairs and the tram had a device to load motorized wheelchairs. Staff seemed friendly and helpful. Everything we saw looked clean and well maintained..alot of the reviews complain about getting around and the at this large resort and I can say it might not be your pick if you hate walking or have physical handicaps But we are pushing 50 and frankly not in the best shape and we were fine with it.. There are trams and water boat taxis to get you around. I found the water taxi to be slowest. we chose to walk most of the time. I've never been at a resort that treated their guests better. Ideal room locations central to beach and parking lot. A pool that's only for rewards guest. preferred reservations and seating's. Restaurant vouchers and free photo shoot with one free pic. They distinguish your rewards status by a special bracelet.. the restaurants like most we found on the island were just ok but very pricey. The best meal we had on the island was there premi\u00e8re beach restaurant that I believe focuses on streak and seafood with a gourmet ish presentation. `husband slept for a few more hours. Our having enough points to get a free 5 day stay definitely influenced our choice of picking this island and resort. i adore snorkeling. which is something this island offers. . ", " Great of families and couples. We did went during the summer so there was a lot of kids, but overall the pool and overall stay was great. The property is huge and there is a lot to see around the facility, from sea life to art work. ", " A vacation for everyone, a taste in cultural worlds, service that cannot be beaten, a place to relax or be exhilarated, adventure in activities... wake boarding, scuba diving, snorkeling, swimming with dolphins, multiple swimming pools, golfing, spas, gyms, programs of local cultures, programs for kids... so much to do and of course never enough time to do it. You will want to return to this place of paradise. Relaxing, large and comfortable room. This is a resort that host thousands of vacationers from across the globe, tranquility can be found, however in the main area of the resort there is a lot of life. The scale of this resort is astronomical, it has its own tram to help you get from place to place, or you can walk, from one side to the other can take 30 mins +, an absolute must amazing scenery, architecture, designs and gardens as well as the ocean views are breathtaking. The resort host its own shopping market, stores and gift stalls, many restaurants. and 2 small shopping centers a short drive away, 1 boasts top designer stores and a amazing restaurant, 2 food market and high street/gift stores. A dream vacation for me. ", " This place is so beautiful it feels like you're on a private island. So serene and tropical and surrounded by the ocean. It's great for families with kids but they also have a pool for adults only. We had a great experience traveling with our two college daughters. ", " Excellent stay! Staff was friendly, professional and very kind and helpful. This property is truly situated on a tropical paradise! Meeting arrangements were great! Tourist attractions were fun. From watching the volcanoes erupt to watch in the kids swim with the Dolphins, it is an enjoyable vacation resort and experience for the whole family. ", " We were blessed with a chance to make our 30th Anniversary trip to this amazing place and stay 8 nights. The attentive staff and wonderful facilities have been unbelievable. We were warned that food and adventures would be expensive, but having taken a day trip into the islands 2nd largest city we found that sit down restaurants on par with those at the resort were actually just as pricey. For a once in a lifetime treat, don't miss this one. We had three relatives give us there personal positive reviews and they were completely right. Save up for this one then don't fixate on the price.I recommend that you request a room in the Makai by the Lagoon and Kona pools. Every room faces the ocean and it is an amazing view to wake up to and fall asleep to.P.S. Our vacation was sandwiched in between two tropical storms. We just crossed our fingers and faired just fine. But Mother Nature can play havoc with vacation plans no matter where you go. We've experienced freak snow storms on Memorial Day at Estes Park, and rain in Arizona. It can happen. ", " Beautiful place, everything near the hotel (dining & shops). We really enjoyed our stay, though didn't utilize much of the amenities on ground other than room and coffee place. Hilton did a beautiful job renovating and upgrading the rooms. BUT the downside is that you have to park far from your room, AND pay $25/day to self park, $30 for valet. It is very pricey after a week! We could have done another outing for the price of parking! Unfortunately they do not offer off-grounds parking. I realize it is this way for many resorts, except the Fairmont...where they have free parking on grounds. We ate at the CanoeHouse there and it was a blessing and relief not to have to pay for parking. Other than that, it is a nice place ESP if you have kids...they have separate beaches and areas for families/kids. We were always off exploring off grounds and only came to stay at night, so we didn't use amenities at all. But it is nice. ", " do not plan a hawaii vacation without hilton waikoloa! the pools and slides were a blast and swimming with the fish and green sea turtles right next to you while on a stand-up-paddle board in the lagoon was surreal. the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff makes everyone feel like special guests. the variety and accessibility to food and beverage makes makes meal times so easy. we extended our stay an extra day because we just couldn't leave... what more can i say. ", " The resort is great as long as you have a large budget. There are shops just down the road to help keep the cost of food down and that helped us. Overall though the resort is really nice. Unfortunately there is no actual beach though. You can get to the beach but its really rocky and not very fun to be on. If you are the type of person that doesn't like to really leave the resort then this place is perfect. They have so many activities but like I mentioned, be prepared to spend some cash. ", " We stayed from 8-27 to 9-1-16. The Big Island is great during this time. No crowds, no lines, no waiting really anywhere. The hotel is clean, spacious, and I don't think there is a bad view to be had. The tram and the ferry boat make it convenient and easy to get around. There are bars and restaurants within walking distance inside and outside the resort. Very convenient! Staff is friendly and helpful as well. Lots of activities within the resort. A few pools for kids and adults. We commented many times that our two and four year old will love it when we come back next time. ", " This is a great place to stay. Good for couples and families. We stayed in the Ocean tower, which is done the end. Would have been better to have stayed in one of the other towers, as they are closer to the restaurants, lobby, etc. It is a huge hotel, a 15 minute walk from our room to the lobby!There is a mono-rail, and boats sometimes, to get around on, but mostly it was faster to walk. There are a number of restaurants, and we tried most of them. KPC was particularly good - sitting out on the deck eating lobster!Lots of pools that weren't too crowded. One adult only pool which I enjoyed.Also enjoyed the gym. Finally, the buffet breakfast was excellent ", " Visited Waikoloa Village July 15th and stayed 7 nights (1st 6 in Ocean Tower with Grand Vacation time share presentation/package including rental car and last night in Lagoon Tower). Had unbelievable views at both. My daughters (18, 15) loved being able to just shuttle or boatride to anywhere they wanted to go on the 62 acre property. My oldest had a fever when we 1st arrived and they gave her a little souvenier which I thought was so nice. The pools with the waterfalls, waterslides, caves, 4 acre ocean attached lagoon with sea turtles and tropical fish to swim/snorkle with- amazing. Loved looking out our hotel lanai to see swimming dolphins and reef sharks, ocean, canals, and pools. The scenery and landscaping was beautiful. The birds were noisy at night, we asked for a fan for white noise and slept fine and I am light sleeper. Think hotel also provides ear plugs if you want. We asked for microwave which they brought right up as we had picked up groceries before arriving. I was worried about the pool towel policy but we just changed them out when we were walking somewhere and it wasn't a big deal. We loved eating at Lava Lava Beach Club by the Marriot, enjoyed a sunset and great meal at KPC (nice place for pictures) and ice cream down by the dolphins, got the all you can eat breakfast once ($30/person), enjoyed sunset up at the Ocean Tower by Buddah statue, loved all the tiki torches being lit up at night, took Body Glove snokeling cruise (65 foot catarmaran, 20 ft slide, jump off 2nd story of boat into ocean, went scuba diving for 1st time to 40 ft-amazing), surfing lessons with Kona Mike, Flumin in Kohala (Loved learning about the history of the island kayaking through caves and tunnels), renting water toys and swimming at A bay (4 hours for $35 by Marriot), rented snorkle equipment for the week for $35 at Snorkle Bobs, loved shopping at King and Queens shops, going swimming and to see sunset at Hapuna Beach and Disappearing Sands Beach, enjoyed a massage at the spa and relaxing there, great show at the Hilton Luau and no problems getting all the food and drinks you could want, and so many beautiful places just to lay by the water and relax as a couple in the evenings. I did not encounter any rude staff, bad crowds and our rooms were clean with beautiful views, resort/parking fee you know before you go. I wish Hawaii was closer to us (live in PA) so we could go back again soon, was a long flight. ", " This was our first time to any of the islands of Hawaii and we are so glad that we chose to stay with the Hilton Waikoloa. What an absolutely stunning resort! We booked in the Ocean Tower and upgraded to an ocean view room, giving us the most amazing view and the opportunity to enjoy the breathtaking sunsets every single evening. The hotel is definitely one you should be prepared to walk around - the tram was a fun option but we very much preferred to walk through the museum-style halls and enjoy the open air sections of the hotels as much as possible. We didn't get a chance to try out the canal boats (definitely on our list for next time).We loved the variety of things to experience throughout the resort, including visiting the dolphins, spotting reef sharks in the canals, and saying hello to three green turtles hanging out on the edge of the lagoon.We purchased luau tickets for the Friday night show and had an amazing time - great food, unlimited drinks (upgraded ticket), and awesome entertainment. You get a lei on entry and can enjoy being seated in a group setting to meet other guests.Room amenities were great and perfect for what we needed, although the resort free of $30/per person seemed a lot for what we got. We try to be environmentally conscious and took advantage of our sheets being swapped out every 4 days instead of every morning, and reused towels as much as possible. The only thing we found a little tough to swallow were the HUGELY inflated prices throughout every store/restaurant/service in the hotel. While we expected things to be a little more expensive being in Hawaii, we didn't expect to pay almost $6 for an energy drink, $13 for cocktails, and $47 for a medium pizza....Our buffet the first morning was $32/person and there's no way we ate anywhere near enough to justify that price.Having a car was hugely valuable as the resort isn't really within walking distance to much outside of its own beaches etc, but be prepared to pay about $20/day too (valet added an extra $5).For those happy to drive or walk, there are great amenities within the FULL resort - you can hop in a car or walk a short way to a little market place that had very affordable fresh food, and an amazing deli (breakfast was around $7 and filled us until dinner), and if you're looking for a chilled evening spot, Tropics Ale House was a 5 minute walk across the street from the main driveway to the Hilton. Definitely alternatives to spending a small fortune in the hotel if you're willing to explore.This was definitely a beautiful resort and one we would come back to. The staff were all extremely sweet and helpful when we needed it; there were parrots and birds in the lobby that guests could admire; and there was a wonderful scent pumped throughout the open-air lobby that I really wish I had asked about, as I would love to have brought that home!Definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a truly Hawaiian luxury experience :) ", " Amazing resort. Loved listening to the dolphins outside our room playing at night and early am. Staff extremely accommodating. Highly recommend the free boat tour around the resort upon arrival to get a true sense of the options available to you during your stay and the sheer beauty of the resort. ", " So, as the kids grow up (now 8 and 12), I continue to ask where they would like to go, anywhere in the world, for that last summer vacation before school goes back. Both girls, 'demand', the Hilton Waikoloa. The property, even after 10 stays, remains fantastic. Not just because of the beautiful setting, but mostly because of the staff there. Friendly Aloha's from everyone from the front desk, to Andrew the tram driver, to Brian the waiter, to Simon Amos and Debbie Bishop, the management team. Nothing has become tired after 10 visits. The pools are as nice, the views are as breathtaking, the restaurants seem to get better and better, and the Luau is an experience of a lifetime. Weather is 90 degrees and sunny everyday, with a little wind (how do you beat that), and the sunset is ridiculous. 180 seconds of heaven. If you have kids, young or old, or are a kid at heart, stay at this resort. You will not want to leave, and you'll be planning your next visit. Mahalo to the staff! What amazing treatment we received AGAIN! ", " Very large property with lots to do; if you get bored here then you have a problem. They have dolphins to swim with, a private lagoon with fish and turtles, a great location geographically to lots of activities and excellent amenities. I didn't like the resort and parking fees.. and the restaurants there were sub par with pretty bad service but in regards to the resort as a whole, I really liked it. ", " We stayed two nights. Wow there is so much art and the place is huge. There is no way I saw even a fraction. The hidden hot tubs are beautiful. The boat ride and the tram are a nice way to travel. I enjoyed just walking around and taking in all of the art work. The restaurants along the water are very nice. ", " I have returned to the Waikoloa area many times over the years. I typically stay at one of the condo's in the area but treated my family to a night in the Hilton hotel. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and are great for families. The lagoon is a great place for kids and first time snorkelers to build confidence (and see so many turtles!). The views are amazing from everywhere on the property. The hotel rooms could do with a refresh. The bathrooms are starting to show their age but this should not take away from the hotels facilities and access to so much to do.I will say that if you have people in your party that have difficulty walking or getting around, this hotel can be daunting. The buildings are palatial and even with the tram, there is a fair amount of walking up and down hills and stairs. ", " This is an amazing hotel in the Big Island let me tell you why:1) 20 min driving (or taxi) from the airport2) has all the infrastructure of a huge hotel3) in front of the see with private lagoon and access to the see4) you can snorkel in the lagoon or get to the see from the lagoon (no need to hire additional snorkeling package). You can see turtles (in the lagoon and open sea) many different fishes, coral, etc. You can rent all equipment, boat, etc5) many different restaurants. I recommend to book a family package if you have kids. It includes breakfast (amazing variety of food) and gives you acces to exclude areas to get chair close to the pool and avoid fight for space every morning. With this package you also get free wifi6) close to shopping malls (restaurants, shops, etc)7) kid have an amazing time in the swimming pool with slides and waterfalls.8) the hotel have a train and a boat to move you around (even though you don't need because you can walk easily) which is a blast with the kids. ", " I came to Big Island and stayed in this Hilton resort again this year. In general, it is a pleasant experience.My room, 8039, has a fairly nice view on the Ocean. It also suits for my need that is away from elevator. Since I did my check-in via Hilton website, the check-in at the lobby is quick and efficient. Wi-Fi coverage in my room is not very good as my room is not close to an access point. Nevertheless, I also use wired connection so it is still okay.I did workout everyday in their fitness center. There are 3 rooms, two for caloric and one for weight. Actually, the one for weight can be crowded in the morning and evening. I did have breakfast, lunch and dinner at selected locations inside this large Hilton resort. Worth mentioning that the quiche made by the Waikoloa Coffee Company is very good, and the service at the Kirin Chinese Restaurant is very efficient. I do not try the room service because I consider it as super-expensive given the very high sub-charge with respect to that in other hotels.Lastly, there is still a significant improvement regarding the Wi-Fi coverage inside this large resort. There are some places that are lack of Wi-Fi access. ", " We stayed here with our 7 and 8 y/o kids and loved it! The rooms are clean, chic and spacious. The lagoon tower is fantastic - closest to the shops, luau, pool, Dolphins and main desk. The other towers are nice but a long walk. The boats and monorail are great but can take awhile to get you from one place to another. The spa was amazing! Lots of great dining options and gorgeous waterfront. Best place to stay with families! Highly recommend. ", " One of our favorite places to stay, the pools and the lagoon are amazing. We saw several sea turtles while exploring the lagoon. The views throughout the hotel are amazing. We make sure to visit the Hilton Waikoloa whenever we visit the big island. ", " Beautiful Hilton Ressort with all the quality and service you can expect from a global brand. A true paradise for kids as the ressort features a huge pool area with waterfalls, a big slide and a cave, followed by an arteficial lagoon with many residents like fish and the famous house turtel. On top of that is a Dolphin research center where kids can have a swim with a Dolphin experience. So many highlights for the little ones. If you are looking for a romantic hideaway without kids, there are many other places on the island which you might prefer. My overal experience was extremely positive. ", " Loved the resort amenities ! Rode the shuttle over every day and swam, ate meals,took nature hikes, explored the massive grounds and noted so many things for any family to do that nobody could complain or get bored.The huge lagoon is the focal point of the resort and is fed by the ocean on the other side. There are water toys of all types for the kids to use and plenty of staff to accommodate. Paddle boards, canoes, water bikes, and snorkel gear just to name a few.The snorkeling was our favorite and we hung out under the waterfall to swim side by side with the islands giant native turtle. The food is expensive and very average for that type of resort. After our entire week on the island we realized that the grocery store at Queens shopping was the best tasting and most economical way to eat. We are foodies and big users of Trip Adviser to find our restaurants when traveling and the reviews were accurate and we chose to ignore the reviews and still shelled out as much as $38 and more for one disappointing meal after another at the local restaurants. The best thing we ate was a chicken club sandwich served at the inside lounge of the main building. We actually ended up there in all three times for the same exact sandwich. If you are there at 8 pm they have some really good live music. There's a bar, but families and couples are seen enjoying a late night meal and dancing to the music with their kids.The resort is clean and extremely well maintained, considering its size. We explored every inch of it, and noted some of the following, none of which is overstated: a monorail like at Walt Disney World, taking guests all through the resort, a boat that travels in a canal that runs the entire resort, also shuttles guests around the expansive grounds, several koi ponds, a hiking trails, more pools than can ever be used, one of which has slides connecting one pool to the next and acts like a lazy river.Museum pieces line many lengths of buildings with beautiful items that are historical in value. They seem to be replicas but they are well presented. Swimming in the lagoon with the tropical fish, and sea turtles would rate highest on our list. Trips outside the resort are most fun to see the volcano at the National Park which is on the other side of the island. We wish we had planned to stay over night for this trip. The best way to do that would be to stay in the hotel in the National Park which we visited and looked nice. If you stayed towards the end of your trip then you could explore that side of the island better. The roads are dangerous at night for tourist travel and not recommended. Staying after dark means you get to see the lava glow from the volcano which looks amazing.Best Hilton resort for any Hilton we have ever seen in all major cities. ", " 25 years ago we visited this hotel and decided if we ever came back to the big island we would stay here instead of Kona. We did and we were thoroughly happy! It is a very large hotel complex, so the distance between things can overwhelm people. Stay in the Makai wing and you will be close to the dolphins, pools, shops and main entrance. Anywhere else and you will have a long walk or have to take one of the shuttles. Our ocean view room from Makai was upgraded so that we were above the dolphin pool so we could watch the dolphins relax and play in the morning and evening when they were not doing the \"Dolphin Experience\". That was a wonderful bonus that we were not expecting. The kids enjoyed the experience of taking the tram to various locales in the hotel and there is a lot in the village area of Waikola that makes this a great location for families. ", " Our room was in the Ocean Towers (looks like a #8). We checked in at the entrance of the resort and took the tram to our room. We loved this location because it gave us more time on the tram (kids). You also get to see more of the resort. The pool was excellent and just outside the door a few steps away. My son loved the slide because it was the fastest one in the resort but shorter. There is a smaller slide for smaller kids. There is a little lazy river like area that leads to another pool. The wait staff will come to you and get your drink orders which is nice. I was always three mai tais to the wind! lol! Ocean Towers is on the peak of the property and the view is stunning in every direction. We requested a room with queen beds with balcony and partial view as we spend a lot of time on the balcony to relax. The lawn was beautiful and we could easily see Buddha Point. The bathroom vanity area was huge with large walk in area closet with bench and lots of shelving, safe, fridge, double vanity. We did a lot of walking. It literally took about 15 minutes to get to the room from the lobby so expect to walk a lot. This resort does not offer beach access but has a lagoon with rental boats, etc. There are lots of dining options and a large buffet breakfast option. We loved this location so much that we bought a timeshare in the Kingsland property and plan on going back in August 2016. ", " We stayed here for a few nights. We were in the Makai rooms in the Lagoon tower. They were going to place us in the Ocean Tower. I asked if we could transfer to the Lagoon towers and they approved that request at no extra charge. The rooms were very big and very clean. Wifi was a bit slow but we were too busy having an awesome time on the Big Island to be using it much anyway.The Lagoon tower is very convenient as it is the closest tower to the Lagoon, the parking lot and the main lobby/shop area. We ate breakfast daily at the Waters Edge Restaurant as part of our package deal. The servers remembered us every day and gave us the same table by the window. They were very attentive! Our children loved snorkeling in the Lagoon and seeing the many colorful fish, angel fish and turtles. It was a great place for them to gain confidence in their snorkeling skills. The grounds are very well kept and we enjoyed taking a walk around them. We also used the laundry facilities on the 4th floor. Clean laundry room and very convenient. We would love to stay here again the next time we visit. ", " This resort was more then my wife and I expected. There is a nice salt water lagoon to go swimming/snorkeling in. Multiple restaurants so you can have some variety with what you are eating. The tram makes it easy to go between the various spots on the resort as well. My wife was also able to do some shopping at the stores that are on site at the resort as well. ", " The views at this resort were incredible. The resort employees were extremely helpful and friendly. The shops, dining and night life was fantastic. The lagoon is a wonderful feature. This unique experience is highly recommended.....will definitely be visiting here again. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village really is one of the most beautiful hotels where I stayed. It has big territory with boats and trains, very nice art collection, many choices for dining. It was a pleasure to walk on the hotel grounds. The hotels hasn\u2019t beach on the ocean, but has a nice lagoon, connected to it. You can enjoy snorkeling in the lagoon to see underwater life. It was my second visit to this hotel, if I will go to the Hawaii Big Island again, I will consider the hotel as a place to stay again. ", " We stayed in the King's Land condominium in building number 7. We had two 2-bedroom rooms on the first floor and they were fantastic. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Beach access was not very easy but we new that going in. The swimming pool was wonderful and very easy to access. Travel between our room and other parts of the resort was provided by bus and was very convenient. We had a great time and would stay there again. ", " One of the best experiences I have had with the family - 7 of us total varying in ages from 13 to 75. This is a great family vacation or couples vacation spot. We were able to enjoy the resort both as a family and as a couple, feeling safe to allow our children the freedom to roam. Gorgeous property and well-kept. ", " Thank you to everyone at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for making my vacation the trip of a Lifetime! There were so many employees that went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. And we did.The resort is large, but it quickly felt like home because everyone made us feel so welcome. And when we needed anything, we had only to ask. Our room was beautiful and the view was amazing. Our experience at DophinQuest is something we will always remember. The pool was awesome, the food was wonderful and the grounds were lush and tropical.I would go back to the Hilton Waikoloa Village for my next Hawaiian vacation. I will look forward to it and if I don't manage to return, I will always have my wonderful memories of a perfect vacation. ", " Well. There is everything here. Great restaurants, great staff, and plenty to do. The property is older but very well maintained. The train is a bit slow but it beats walking since this property is very big. I like smaller properties but this place is still incredible. ", " We had the most enjoyable relaxing vacation/honeymoon there at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were kept very clean and the grounds were beautiful. The pools are amazing, especially the one with the waterfall and grotto hot tub. There was always something to do on and off the grounds, so we were never bored unless we chose to be. I will be recommending this resort to everyone I know that would ever want to travel to the big island! ", " Built nearly 30 years ago.....still very modern.....BOATS AND A MONORAIL TRAIN !!!WORTH A VISIT EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT STAYING OVERNIGHT !HUGE RESORT....PALACE ROOMS ARE QUIETESTMANY POOLS, A LAGOON and a rocky beach.All the West side resorts are 30 to 50 minutes to town so a car should be rented for your vacation.Recommended stay at least 3 nights to see all the facilities. 7 days max ... Bargain when rates are $220 OR LESSFOOD IS NOT CHEAP.......should stock up on fruits and drinks from supermarket.....or hotels inhouse snack shop ", " This place is mind blowing. The scale and size of it, the beauty, the facilities are unbelievable. We stayed in Makai rooms which were very large and modern and had an amazing view over the lagoon. The different pools were fantastic, particularly the main Kona pool which had water slides, rope bridges, waterfalls etc. The restaurants are a bit expensive but there are options in the area (we went to Sansei Japanese in the shopping center down the road a couple times which was very good). A great place to stay with plenty to do. ", " Best place to relax and see Dolphins and come together as a family. Got to enjoy many activities on this trip and most importantly got to spend them with my family. Refreshing to lay your head a clean and friendly environment. ", " I have seen so many pros and cons on this place. So here are my thoughts.What a beautiful place! Sure the walks from Ocean Tower to Lagoon Tower are long but look around you....there is so much beauty! I figure we were on vacation and really didn't care if the walk was long it was too pretty to complain.Sure there is not a beach here but you should just rent a car and drive to them. Each beach has its own little unique characteristics so it was nice beach hopping.The lagoon was fun! Get there early to get a chair. I brought some towels from home so it was nice having those as back ups for when we traveled to a beach elsewhere on the island. The only thing I didn't like about the lagoon were those motorized snorkel propellers (no clue of their name). There were sort of loud and got in the way. I only saw them once the whole stay so maybe no one really rents them much anyway.I liked our room. Ocean Tower, Nice size for two people. Comfortable bed, big closet, nice size dresser to unpack, frig is a plus for breakfast items, snacks and drinks. Breakfast Buffet to me was way overpriced. Just not worth the 22.95. We ended up buying cereal and other items. We just don't eat enough breakfast to justify that price every day.I did wish that the Mahlolo Lounge stayed open a bit longer. They closed at 11. Nice drink, good food, good service.KPC for dinner out. Make a reservation for sunset and sit outside.HHonors members receive coupons for meals each day. $20 to use each day on any food or drink items. I liked this! Thank you! Overall, I cannot wait to go back. It was a nice escape from reality. The grounds were immaculate, artwork everywhere and just a wonderful vacation. Thanks Hilton! ", " I took my kids for a mini Vacation and so glad we went to the Hilton...They gave us an amazing Airline Rate..with a wonderfull room overlooking the golf courses...The resort is like Disneyland but so big you never feel crowed..the kids and I walked around in awe..waterslides..swimming through caves to snorkeling in the lagoon..we had a car but really didn't need it...my youngest got sick and it was the day we were to fly out..they offered us a late check out which gave him the extra rest he needed to make the flight..I will forever be grateful!..We are already planning next years trip! ", " We really enjoyed our stay and the hotel grounds and facilities were very nice. The staff was courteous and always helpful. The views are excellent and my daughter loved the different pools and lagoon. I enjoyed the paddle surfing and snorkeling! We live on the east side of the Island and it's very nice for our stay cations! ", " We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. So much to do and see just at the hotel. Wish we could have stayed longer. Clean first class hotel. The Palace Tower is nice and quite, I've heard that some of the other tower can have some noise because of the birds. ", " We loved Hilton Waikoloa Village! Hands down best hotel on the island! Lots of things to do and amenities! The big island breakfast was really good and convenient! Next time we want to be able to try more of their restaraunts on site, looked really good just didn't have time. Great place for families! We will bring our kids next time! ", " Great place for family vacation, especially if you stay in the Makai building. We chose the Makai building because of its location and water views. We found out after checking in that it had more perks than the other buildings. We chose the ocean side with dolphin and saltwater lagoon views. With a Makai room you get larger newly renovated rooms, preferential treatment at the Kona pool and other facilities on the property. You also get discounts on purchases. We had a large party of 18, all family, including 8 children(although my 3 teenage grandchildren would not consider themselves children). We were there for 7 days, and left the village only 1 day to explore the island. Everyone was satisfied to just stay at the village.The only thing that I would change would be to place more umbrellas around the pools and lagoons. It got quite hot in the sun.Overall, a great place to vacation. Great memories for our family. ", " Great place to visit your children will love the pools and swimming with the dolphins. Lots of other activities for the family too. the room is very nice and comfortable .and love the shops close by. Will visit again ", " This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Nice people, beautiful art, lagoon, etc. The problem came when I could not access the wifi. It was a continual problem and they did nothing to fix it for two days. I was never able to fully access their wifi. Even when I was sitting in their lounge and I showed access I had no access. The tram picks you up and your on your way. It stops at the next place and then backtracks to the last pick up. Then it continues on to further destinations. You can only get on one way, so you have to wait for the tram to pass before you can cross to the other side. ", " From the moment we arrived we have been treated like royalty. The staff is right on task with everything. We spent the day at the most amazing resort pool ever! Lagoon with water toys, pool with huge waterfall and dolphin experience all in one place. Truly amazing. Food amazing and we love it. Added an extra day until we head to Maui! ", " Fabulous resort hotel. 5 star for sure. Service was excellent. Loved the body treatments left in room everyday. Even had to pinch a few to take home off the maids trolley. Huge hotel with a monorail system or a boat to take you to your room. Restaurants were expensive but great quality.. A bit out of the way but the onsite Dolphin lagoon made up for that. Needless to say, my daughter had to swim with them which was an amazing experience. Would recommend to anyone with or without children who want a relaxing holiday. ", " This resort is huge! It has all the amenities you could ask for. Love the lagoon and dolphins. It has a lot of options for dining. Lots of activities. Great hotel for family. Beautiful location on the beach. ", " This hotel has it all- food, pools, shopping and so much to enjoy gazing at! My granddaughter was is awe of the flora, trees, fish and animals, but her favorite were the sea turtles. Take advantage of the $35 deal at the beach offered by Ocean Sports. We kayaked, snorkeled, boogie boarded and rode the Glass Bottom Boat. We tried the stand-up surf board but had trouble with that. Be prepared to walk or wait for the tram, which is great unless you are in a hurry. ", " We stay in a Condo in Hawaii but needed a hotel room for one night this time. We were familiar with this resort because we paid for day use the prior year. It is definitely all inclusive with several restaurants, plenty of shopping, a lagoon, toddler beach, and even a tram and boat to get you to your rooms. Everything is very clean and the view from the ocean towers was incredible. They are very accommodating and do everything to make sure your stay is a good one. The staff even hold your luggage if your rooms are not ready or if you need to check out and still want to swim for the rest of the day. ", " There are no words to describe this breath taking resort. Look no further than this resort when coming to the big island! The rooms were beautiful as well as the landscaping details. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Felt like we were at home away from home. This resort truly gave us a lifetime memory. ", " This is a beautiful location and beautiful resort. Our children enjoyed the Keiki club which allowed us to golf. The staff was wonderful, the pools and slides were fun for all of us. The ease of getting around the resort was wonderful and had enough to keep us busy the whole week if we wanted. ", " This is always our go to hotel when visiting Kona. Beautiful grounds and great service. Boats and monorail operating within the hotel is such a cool touch. Great food, great amenities, great location. Will never go to another hotel when visiting Kona. Highly recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed. ", " This resort is well managed and excellent designed. Upon our arrival and unloaded our luggage, the bell staff brought our luggage after we arrived to our room just five minutes. Concierge was very helpful to organize our activities. We found a wonderful restaurant nearby, Sansei in Queen's Market. We loved the sear tuna salad, salmon belly. Surprisingly they made an age ribeye steak that was outrageous delicious. I have not had a steak tasted so good. Only problem that bed is too soft for us. We like former bed. That caused us minor backache. Well, we recovered. ", " This is our favorite hotel to stay at on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, situated right on the beach with a beautiful lagoon, huge pool, great fitness room, trams and boats for the kids to ride on around the property, and just overall beautiful scenery, friendly and courteous staff and great value. My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon 26 years ago and it is still one of our top 5 favorite hotels in the USA. ", " Friendly staff. Have you ever seen workers behind the registration desk doing office work while there is a long line during check-in? Not here. Staff at front desk and checkout counters helped to minimize wait time. ", " We (2 adults, 2 kids 15 10) went for a week back in Feb 2012 (NOT Feb 2015). The overall resort is breath-taking. The decor is magnificent and there are lots of Buddha statues around. (I thought they were a nice touch)We stayed in the Lagoon Tower. We had a room with a balcony that faced the ocean (breath-taking sunsets). It was also directly above the Dolphin Quest area, which the 15 year old absolutely loved. (we did not do Dolphin Quest because it was expensive) The only downside is that the birds are VERY vocal as the sun rises.Getting around the huge resort is fun. You can walk, take the monorail, or ride on the boat! There were at least 3 pools as well as a lagoon with sea turtles and tons colorful fish you could go snorkeling, paddle boarding, etc.Lots of great places to eat within the resort, but can get pricey. Awesome breakfast buffet. Lots of activities going on for everyone to enjoy. We kept a lot of the soaps and shampoos from the room to take home. They smelled amazing. (the 15 year old still has a few bottles from the trip 3.5 years ago) ", " I booked this resort based on their wonderful property I viewed online and I was not disappointed. The Hilton was even better in person! We experienced all they had to offer: Swimming with Dolphins, a Luau, snorkeling in the lagoon, their fantastic pools, onsite professional photography, shopping and even the top notch transportation around the resort. As my teenagers said \"This hotel and vacation was epic\"! ", " I was very pleased overall with the Hilton Waikaloa Village. It's a large resort with plenty of pools, good service and even a tram to carry you from one end to another. I rented a cabana one day and enjoyed that. Make sure you go to the orientation each morning in one of the lounges. That was great in setting up our weeks activites. ", " We stayed here for the Kona Marathon, and the stay was remarkable. We were given a great room at a fair price, and the resort had everything we needed. Meals were a little overpriced, but it was close enough to everything to be able to drive into Waikoloa Village or into Kailua-Kona! We will be visiting again next year! ", " Enjoyed every fun filled day snorkelling, paddle boarding, kayaking in the lagoon and outside, relaxing in the sun great restaurants, entertainment with dolphins. It is an absolute paradise for children and grandparents. Adequate laundry, easy access around the site if you preferred not to walk. Rooms grand size with balconies. Go with your children/grandchildren before they get too old and enjoy ", " The services are nice and everyone is very helpful... as long as you have enough money. Nothing is done for free and there are a lot of hidden taxes and unexpected fees. Do not plan your expenses, go only if you can afford it... 5000$ is near minimum needed for a comfortable week. ", " My youngest child loved the pools, waterslide and the waterfalls. Thought the waterfalls was impressive. Pools were clean every day. The property is huge depending on what tower you are at. We stayed at lagoon which I thought was very good. It is the closet to the main lobby, dolphins (LOVE THEM),pools. The property is beautifully landscaped and the rooms are spacious. everyday they were doing something with the grounds. There is no direct access to ocean swimming but the resort is oceanfront with beautiful sunset views. ", " I recently stayed at this resort with my adult daughter, sister and young niece for 6 nights.It is very big, with monorails and a boat to help get you around the resort if you don't want to walk it. The resort has numerous restaurants to choose from, a coffee shop which sells breakfast items, convenience stores, ice cream shop and various stores to buy burgers, pizza, snacks etc by the pools. The pools are amazing, very clean with waterfalls, water slides, and a lagoon pool with all sorts of water activities, fish and turtles.Right in the middle of the pools is the dolphins, which, for a price, you can have an encounter with. My niece spent a lovely afternoon being given an educational talk on marine creatures and then had about 20 mins in the water with the dolphins.The rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained.We found the beds comfortable, housekeeping bought up extra towels, pillows and blankets on request.Our room had 2 basins in a separate area to the toilet and shower which was very handy for the 4 of us.By paying the daily resort fee, we had free wifi and bottled water in the room each day.A short trolley ride ($2 pp per ride) or 15 minute walk from the resort is 2 shopping areas, (King and Queens) that have a larger ABC style store, various restaurants and shops. The Italian at Queens is very nice.We visited here a few times in the late afternoon for a bit of shopping and dinner for a change from the resort.We used the car rental at the resort and the tour desk to book tours.Both were very helpful and efficient.We ate at the Mexican Cantina at the resort which was nice and the Chinese restaurant which was lovely, however quite pricey.We attended a Luau also at the resort, it was good, lovely food and endless cocktails all inclusive. After dinner, an entertaining show is put on by talented dancers. We hired a car and went to Kona just past the airport (easy 1/2 hour drive) where there is a Walmart, Denny's restaurant and other shopping and sightseeing. I would recommend this resort for family's and anyone who wants to relax at a resort in beautiful surroundings and have fun in the pools. ", " Had an issue with the room when we first got here the assistant manager straightened it all out and made everything worthwhile great customer service is always wonderful. Get an ocean view room in the ocean towers beautiful. This is our fifth trip we love it a lot here. ", " Resort is breathtaking. Man-made snorkel pond and beach is great. Swimming with the dolphins is great for the kids. Amazing pool. Natural ocean front is not good for swimming with not much sand and lava rock everywhere. Amazing sunsets. Staff is very accommodating and friendly. Depending on what tower you stay in, it can be quite a distance from where you want to go as the resort is very large. Can't really go wrong at this resort. Second time we have visited this resort and would go back again. ", " Just back from a week-long stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. My wife and daughter (9) had an amazing vacation on the big island and our time at the Hilton Waikoloa was fabulous. Leading up to the trip, we read many of the reviews on TripAdvisor.com. We read about the <30 minute> walks from Ocean Tower to the lobby. We read about the <$50> pizzas at Dona & Toni's, we read about the dilapidated rooms, the lack of beaches...These excessively negative reviews MUST be from employees at the neighboring Marriott because they are so exaggerated...bordering on pure lies. Most of the reviews on here all say the same thing so at the risk of repeating, I will debunk the negative myths that have been shared on this site, and also provide our \"insider knowledge & recommendations\" for those of you lucky enough to be planning a trip out to Waikoloa.Firstly, the distance from room to lobby. We stayed at the Ocean Tower, which is furthest from the lobby. At a leisurely pace, it was 9 minutes from room to lobby. In all honesty, I've had much longer walks at other hotels that have been absolutely boring with nothing to see. At the Hilton Waikoloa, your walk is enhanced by the endless art and artifacts that are on display. Predominately Asian works, the paintings, wood carvings and sculptures are beautiful. As you make your way through the corridor, you have beautiful art on one side and the sapphire-blue bay on the other. Now, after a long day driving across the island or snorkeling at a neighboring beach, even a 9 minute walk can seem strenuous. No worries at the Hilton...hop on an air-conditioned tram or open-air boat and relax as you are taken to your tower. Many have complained that once at the pools or lagoon, the walk to the room is lengthy. Again, an extreme exaggeration. The Lagoon & Ocean towers each have their own pools with bars and water slides. If you at you tower's respective pool, the walk is not more than 5 minutes. However, if you are at the Lagoon Tower pool and need to walk to the Ocean Tower (opposite end of property), it will be about 10 minutes. But again, the VIEW IS AMAZING. Dolphins swimming & playing and also being taken care of with the utmost of care, lava and coral beaches being caressed by Hawaiian ocean, ocean fed salt water lagoon filled with all species of fish, as well as sea turtles (which we snorkeled next to almost every day...honestly, other than the open ocean, where can you do that?!?!?), beautiful landscaping...just an idyllic Hawaiian setting. Postcard-esque! The water slide at the Ocean Tower pool is shorter but much faster. And yes, the Lagoon Tower pool is chilly, but not terribly so. I would venture to guess a temp of about 80. But honestly, after baking in the sun, even 90 degree water will seem chilly at first. You quickly get used to it. True, there are no sand beaches at the property. All are either black lava or white coral. Swimable beaches are very close by (A-bay is a short shuttle trip and Hapuna Beach is a 7 minute drive). You can swim or snorkel at the Hilton Waikoloa's beaches but it is not recommended. A sunset walk across any of these is breathtaking. Plus, you can 'leave your mark' by using black lava on the white coral beach (or vica versa) to write messages. Hard to explain in words but search for the pictures. My daughter & I wrote a note to mom, and I expect it will always be there. Secondly, the condition of the rooms. Mind you, when we travel, we spend very little time in the room. We use it to sleep and freshen up before going out to dinner. That's about it. Now with that being said, we expect adequate space, amenities and quality. Within our Ocean Tower room, our expectations were met. Sure, there was a skuff mark here & there on the furniture and the phone was missing one of the buttons but big deal. We never used the phone and unless you really looked for imperfections (which, I guess I did, after reading these reviews) you saw none. The room was very spacious with 2 queens and a terrace overlooking the ocean and golf course. Mauna Kea hid the rising sun to the NorthEast each morning until about 8am. We had a small fridge which came in very handy for the treats we purchased at Island Gourmet...more to come on that. Housekeeping promptly made up the room before noon every day and consistently provided great service. A tremendous service provided at the Hilton Waikoloa are 'freshening up' rooms for those guests on red eye flights back to the mainland. For no charge, you can use a vacant room to shower & change before leaving for your flight. You have 45 minutes to use the room...more than enough for this family of 3 to shower, change and pack up. The food at the resort was good. Not 5 star gourmet but we didn't expect it to be. We only ate at Lagoon Grill, Dona & Toni's, the luau and the big breakfast buffet. Yes, it's expensive. But let's be honest...it's a resort...ON HAWAII! Everything is expensive on the island. As such, you must consider value. That is, the perception of what you get for what you pay. I challenge anyone to compare the value of the Hilton's food & beverage offerings to those of other Big Island resorts and tell me the Hilton significantly lags behind. Again, a huge myth! Service, atmosphere, variety all add to the value. The breakfast buffet offers lower priced options than the $30 all you can eat buffet but even if you go for the $30 option, there is something for everyone, including a very nice ethnic area towards the back which provides breakfast options from further West including miso soup, fried rice and other Asian specialties. Abundant fruits and pastries, more than you can eat egg options with all of the traditional breakfast meat options. Cereals, yogurt (non-fat greek, as well as low-fat regular). Food at the other restaurants was also good. The exemplary service makes the experience at any restaurant on property that much better. Everywhere we ate or drank on property, we experienced excellent service. The luau was really awesome. We've been fortunate to have traveled to Hawaii once before and attended the Old Lahania luau on Maui. The Hilton's luau was just as good, if not better. Maybe I'm a bit biased as I was selected to go up on stage and \"display\" my hula skills. Ugh, what a site it must have been. At least I gave my new Hawaiian shirt a good workout! The history of Hawaii is told very simply and we found it very interesting. Such amazing stories that we will research over the next few months. Many have commented on the Island Gourmet/ABC shop at the Queens Marketplace, just a short 1/2 mile from the hotel entrance. For those familiar with Fresh Market, this store reminded me of one on steroids. Prepared foods, sandwiches, fruit, sushi, snacks, full liquor and wine offering and a complete clothing & jewelry section. Great option for grabbing road trip food on your way out of Waikoloa Tips for the first timer to Kona/Waikoloa:- rent a car (preferably a Jeep) and drive...EVERYWHERE! If you're not pulling over frequently at scenic overlooks across the island or at interesting landscape that catches your eye, I guess your steering wheel might need adjustment. During our 7 night stay, we managed to drive around and through the entire island; North out of Waikoloa, West over HI-19 through Waimea & Honoka'a and down HI-11 (STOP AT AKAKA FALLS) through Hilo to Volcano Nat'l Park...A MUST TO VISIT! We stayed one night at the Kiluea Lodge down in Volcano. Will write a review on that shortly. HI-11 down through Punalu's (go to the Black Sand beach and home to sea turtles) and back up North on the West side of the island through Kona and back to Waikoloa. If you did the drive non-stop, it would probably be close to 8 hours. You will stop A LOT! Hence, why we spent a night away from 'home'. We experienced some of the best excursions on any trip. These included:1) Fair Winds snorkel - morning snorkel with BBQ lunch. I can't easily put into words how breathtaking and memorable this excursion was. About 70 minutes from the hotel2) Waipio on Horseback - 4x4 trek down to the valley floor and then an hour horseback through the rain forest. Eating fruit off of trees that only grows on the valley floor was just one of the highlights. Sarah and her crew were top notch! about 90 minutes from hotel.3) Driving to Mauna Kea for sunset & star gazing. North on HI-19, west on Waijoloa Road and then eventually intersect with Saddle Road. Not a difficult drive, even in the fog, as you approach and ascend through the cloud deck. Visitor center is at an elevation of about 9500', so you will feel the effect of the thin air. 4x4 is only permitted beyond the center, up to the 14,000' summit. Take extreme caution if you decide to go. Make sure you can handle the altitude and on your way down the mountain, use LOW 4x4 and take it slow. DO NOT RIDE YOUR BRAKES! They will quickly burn out and....let's just say, you will not be in a good place!4) Volcano Nat'l Park. YOU MUST GO! Lava lake that glows orange-red at night, steam vents, craters, Thurston Lava Tube. Do the research and GO! Even if you need to squeeze it into your plans, DO IT! One of the most amazing places I've ever visited5) Ali'i Drive. South of the hotel, about 40 minutes. Take HI-19 past the airport. At Palani Road, turn right and drive down to the waterfront...about two blocks. As you begin to curve left, The Fish Hopper Restaurant will be on your left. Kailua Bayfront...steps from the water. It's a casual, beachy place but serves up really great food & drinks. Grab a table right in front, order a Longboard Ale and stare into the bay. After you eat (and drink a bit), continue driving or walking up Ali'i dirve. Tons of cool shops and restaurants, as well as some historical venues. If you drive the entire stretch of Ali'i drive, you will end up South about 6 miles, but it is SO worth it. Very picturesque, hugging the coast. You'll end up intersecting with Kamehameha III Road, which has an awesome scenic lookout. It will intersect with HI-19, which you would then take back north towards the airport and Waikoloa. 6) Hapuna Beach, about 5 miles North of the hotel, just off of HI-19. White sand beach that is fairly wide, even at high tide. Surprisingly good snack bar with a good variety of food. Very clean bathroom facilities. My daughter & I snorkeled here, as there is a clump of rocks just off shore, which attract very large and beautiful fish. 7) Lava Lava Beach Club, just past the Marriott on the right. You can't miss the signs. This is a beach-front restaurant that epitomizes everything Hawaii. A true experience not to be missed at sunset. Without any exaggeration, this may have been one of the top 3 experiences we've ever been part of...ANYWHERE! GO!!! Well, I'm approaching 10,000 characters and the combination of my fingers hurting and my depression of not being there now means I am wrapping up. I must call out a few folks at the Hilton that exemplified service excellence...Merla at the concierge desk. Bob & Tanya in the office...Bob, ALOHA & MAHALO for everything. Jessica at the front desk. Carmela, who took stunning pictures of us at sunset in front of KPC....honestly, if I could name everyone, I would. Do your research and book the Hilton Waikoloa with confidence for a memorable vacation that will exceed expectations ", " Family trip in June 2015 to celebrate 50 year wedding anniversary of my fabulous in-laws. Beautiful landscape and lots of flora and fauna to enjoy. The lagoon offered a lot of opportunities to see sea turtles up close and Moorish idols along with many other fish. We got more adventurous and snorkeled everyday out by cabana #10 and saw a lot more fish. We saw yellow tangs, eels, Moorish idols, Picasso triggerfish, parrot fish, damsel fish, yellow trumpet fish, sea turtles and many more. Had to be very careful getting in by the volcano rock however worth the effort. The pinnacle for the stay for me was swimming with the Dolphins. Some other highlights were the boat ride, sunsets and walks around the property. One of the best people we met was our cabana server Barb who was so friendly and a delight. We also got great service from Johanna out by the cabana as well. Every morning at breakfast we were given over the top service from Sheryl which started each day out right. Thanks for all the great memories! ", " This is an awesome place to stay. It is an enormous property beautifully decorated with trees and oriental artifacts. Like other users have mentioned, there is no \"beach\" as such that the resort can boast of, because the coastline is very rocky at that place. However, it is right there on the ocean with a lagoon that is kinda privately owned by the resort. Also, the sunset view from the resort is breathtaking. There are 3 big towers which are connected via a couple of trams that run every 5 mins. We stayed at the Palace tower which is in the middle of the other two. The pool is huge and has waterfalls and caves which make it spectacular. There is a water slide to add to the excitement. And then there are a lot of activities you can do in the lagoon. The rooms are ok, just like any other good hotel. But there's so much to do in the resort that you end up using the room for sleep and shower only. Our room was one in a corner of the building. So we somewhat disliked the fact that it was a long walk to the elevator, but that also meant that it was quiet and peaceful. Rooms were clean and spacious. Every room has a PS3 and the main floor of the building has DVD rental kiosk (just like redbox) where you can rent free DVDs (included in the resort fee). Though, we never even touched the ps3 as we were on a low-tech, relaxing vacation and wanted to stay away from the gadgetry as much as possible.The restaurants are good but expensive. We liked the Italian one where we ate almost everyday. Just to give an idea, it takes about $40+ for a large pizza and $20 for one pasta entree. Fortunately, there are a couple of malls and food courts at a walking distance just outside the resort, that you can try out too. Breakfast is very elaborate and worth the money ($30). Staff is excellent. Besides the tens of items offered and placed for self-service, the made-to-order omelettes are a delight and they will make you waffles etc. too, upon request. Every morning we requested for a table that was hosted by Sheryl who is one of their hostesses. She is an awesome person and she made our breakfast experience very pleasant.Parking is expensive - $25 a day and a bit tiresome to use because it is a long walk from the huge parking lot to the main lobby (and then to your room, unless you wait a few minutes and take the tram). We didn't use the valet service which is just $5 more. It seemed like the valet folks were quick but we did see big lines for people waiting for their cars. So, can't be sure.Location wise, it is very convenient - about 30 mins from Kona airport. Also, it has in its proximity what you would need on a day to day basis - gas station, convenience store, restaurants and food courts (and stores like Macy's if you're a shopaholic).All in all, it's a great resort to relax and unwind. Kids will definitely love it. If we return to the Big Island (which we believe we will soon) we will definitely stay here, albeit we may request a room in the Lagoon tower which is closer to the pool and the main lobby. ", " If you can't decide where to stay when you come to the big Island, book Hilton Waikoloa Village. It is by far the best resort for families on the island!The pool is amazing. If you have kids that can't swim yet, they have a kiddie pool that has a sand bottom that is perfect for little ones. If you have bigger kids, then they will love the bigger pool with Waterfalls and waterslide.I have attached a photo of the kiddie pool.We received an amazing cabana room right in front of the dolphin pond. We can sit on our lanai and watch the dolphins play. Amazing!. I have attached a photo of the view from my room. Ask for a cabana room in the Makai building. The best cabana rooms are the ones on the pool side of the building. The cabana rooms are great because they are on the ground floor and you can walk right out of your room onto the grass into the pool. If you do not stay at the Hilton, you will be bummed, Nothing compares to this resort.Make sure to reserve a cabana by the pool, Barbara our cabana attendant is amazing. She always make sure we have plenty of ice water and that we have everything we need, like fresh towels.The bar servers come right to your cabana and make sure your adult beverages never go empty.Last night we had dinner at the Chinese restaurant on property, it was also amazing. Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had.There is a great little pizza place on property that is reasonably priced for families on a budget.My six-year-old son loves this hotel because we can take the tram to the restaurant for dinner, then take a boat trip back to our room through the lagoon canal. No other hotel I've ever seen has a Mana rail like Disneyland, and a canal that runs through the resort with boats to take you where you want to go. Crazy cool!The staff at the hotel is amazing. The folks at the front desk are always friendly and quick to help if you have any problems. Ryan and Samantha have been incredible.We love this resort, wish we never had to leave.Mike B ", " This hotel was really gorgeous and luxury my room was so nice the luau was so nice the food was really good I stayed at the ocean tower the tram ride was nice and the canal boat ride was nice too this August I'm going here again but the Amenities were good ", " We love this place. It is great for kids and family. Slides are a hit with the kids. On-site lagoon is fun to catch a glimpse of turtles and fish. Dolphin encounter was educational and neat to interact. Perfect for kid-friendly vacation. Dining was decent and you can expect to pay higher prices at any amusement park ;) But worth it to make memories! ", " LARGE hotel with a tram, or boat to take you to your room. It is build around a lagoon and simply looking into the water early in the day you can see more beautiful colourful tropical fish that you will on many snorkel adventures. A huge green turtle swam up to look at me as I stood on the short. Kids love splashing at the lagoon beach. Other beaches were good for snorkelling but rocky. Lots of swimming pools with slides both shallow and deeper ones. My favourite was the adult pool where the guard checked regularly and asked any families to leave. It was quiet and great for reading. There is a Dolphin Quest area, but we loved to stand and watch the dolphins frolic from the lagoon restaurant. Parking was expensive at $25 a day as were some of the restaurants but any food we had was excellent. The breakfast buffet offered a lower price for guests arriving before 7:00 am. There is a shuttle to nearby shops, and lots of shops in the hotel. Rooms were excellent, spotless and well kept. Staff were friendly which is important to me. The room prices were better than I would have expected in a first class resort in June. Likely higher now its summer break! ", " As a Hilton Honors member, I was really looking forward to eventually being able to experience this resort when I visited Hawaii. This Hilton property is very large and it takes a bit to get the lay of the land but wow! Once you get your bearings, this place is amazing! Truly beautiful location and views along with plenty of activities. Even with the size of the resort, the pools and activities were not overwhelming, we had no problems each day getting a spot at the pools or lagoon. The path around the resort is not to be missed on an early morning walk especially. We stayed in the Ocean View Tower and no problem getting around the resort easily even though we were on a far end. Self parking was easily accessible. We also experienced the Dolphin Quest. You must have a reservation ahead of your visit to guarantee a spot. We did the Deluxe Encounter with Chelsea and for the amount we paid, we found it worth the money. My 11 and 14 yo truly enjoyed the experience as did my husband and I and Dolphin Quest of course had photographers available to capture the experience which I greatly appreciated.Any and all staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The only odd interaction was with an employee at the organic skin care store off the lobby, not sure how much Hilton has in oversee of that store, but it felt like a 'mall' experience,the employee practically dragged me into the store along with further insulting me in order to try to sell me skin care items. I didn't purchase a thing. Definitely not an asset to the resort. And honestly I never saw anyone in the store the entire stay. I don't feel it necessary to take away from the resort just because of that interaction but guests may want to steer clear when passing by the storefront.Overall, we had an incredible time, and we look forward to returning to this resort! ", " I have never been to a better hotel as the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I love it and plan to spend a week there every year. I love the sculptures, the pictures on the walls, the many pools, especially the pools covered with sand. It is the best of the best. ", " I absolutely had the best time ever. This place is amazingly beautiful and the food was the best tasting around. The artifacts around the resort were beautiful. The train was awesome. I wish I could live here. I will be back sooner than later. ", " We were at the resort for 7 days. It does take a bit of time to get your bearings as the property is vast but that is also what makes it so great. We stayed in Ocean Tower which is the farthest from the Lobby - but it was nice and had everything we needed. It has its own pool and is just a short walk to the slide pool area and the lagoon. The cantina was great and the tram and boats come regularly so you don't have to wait long if you don't want to walk. The grounds are breathtaking and the grounds are also very clean. We had a lovely room - with lots of space. The coffee house downstairs was great and each tower has a concierge. The meeting rooms and ballroom were very nice as well. The whole stay was wonderful. Can't wait till our next trip! ", " Stayed here for a few days while in town for marathon. I was pleasantly surprised. The property was nice. So much to do for kids! We stayed in the palace tower. The rooms were very spacious. I think they could use a touch of updating. The restaurants on site were good but expensive. Overall I would stay here again anytime. If you have kids this gets a thumbs up. ", " This resort provided a variety of activities that appealed to our entire family. We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary and were greeted with a bottle of champagne on our first night. We had our anniversary dinner at KPC on site and it was wonderful. The setting was beautiful and the food and wine excellent. The family enjoyed the lagoon with its fish and turtles as well as the pools, water falls, and water slides. Having Dolphin Quest on site was another adventure. The grandchildren really enjoyed the monorail and the boat ride around the resort. A nice addition is that the walkways are lined with museum quality decor and artifacts. ", " I called and spoke with Emily Hammond to inquire about our upcoming trip to the hotel. She was very professional, helpful and supportive in my concerns and questions about our upcoming trip. Thank you Emily for all of your hard work and dedication in making our trip a successful one. See you in a few weeks. We will be sure to stop by and say hello!!! ", " Fantastic family holiday destination. The facilities at the resort are just amazing for families. We had the best time. I would give them 5 stars for that. Customer service I would rate good and poor for a certain few. The customer service of a few let us down.Safe wouldn't open in room and had to wait over an hour for someone to come help. Booking children into activities was not easy. Went to front counter and then given phone to book them in. Then put on hold for over 10mins and ended up hanging up and decided to go in search of the desk were we could actually speak face to face. Asked at a coffee shop in resort where the activities desk was and they had no idea. It was such a mission. It was a beautiful resort it was just such a shame about the customer service. I really think they need to work on it. ", " Love this place. This was our third time staying at Waikoloa. Every time we go we enjoy it more. The near by Anaeho'omalu Bay is a great place to enjoy the beach and snorkel. The staff at this resort are very nice and helpful. the room is clean and lovely. There are several great restaurants readily available at the resort. A couple of our favorites were Lava Lava, Provisions and if you are in the mood to venture a little north, the Seafood grill at Kawaihae was fantastic. Will return! ", " This beautiful hotel continues to excel our expectations. We celebrated a very special time and the front desk is always so helpful. I also want to say that the valet service was friendly and helpful. Thank you for a great stay, see you again soon. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village is very very nice! Its a beautiful resort with lots to do! Everyone who works at the resort was very nice and my wife and I felt very comfortable there. There is so much fun stuff to do on and off the resort. Examples are lake where you can go paddle boating, lounge with bar and pool, plenty of shops, pools with jacuzzi, restaurants, beach, helicopter rides, ziplining, luaus and so much more. It was truly a magical experience that I will never forget. We loved Hawaii so much we almost bought a vacation home there! ", " Very happy with our room. This was a business trip for my husband and I tagged along. We had a room with a fantastic view of the ocean and the resort. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and professional. ", " Even thought it\u2019s been a month and a half, we are still in post vacation depression because we had such an amazing time at the Hilton Waikaloa Village. This is by far the best place to stay on the Big Island. The property is stunning, diverse and very well maintained. Morning walks are spectacular\u2014there is so much to explore. The food is delicious. Highly recommend the Spam Pineapple Burger at the Lagoon Grill. There is something for everyone at this mega resort. But one thing stands out: The PEOPLE! Now, courteous and professional conduct on the part of the resort staff is expected. But this was exceptional because my wife and I got the impression that the staff really loves what they do...and it showed. If a guest is a jerk, no matter, as the staff will still be accommodating and professional. But show an interest in the staff as people, and they will return any kindness four fold. And that's what they did for us. They treated us as if they had known us forever and that we weren't just paying tourists. We felt at home.Our stay was made so pleasant by the hospitality of ALL the Hilton staff. There were many times that we intended to dine off property but were so well taken care of by the great people there, that we stayed at the resort. Everyone was friendly and outgoing but there are a few people that really stand out.Lawrence at the Lagoon Grill was so welcoming and personable. We will never forget him. Great conversation and hospitality kept us at the grill for hours. He also went beyond the call of duty when he heard our room wasn\u2019t ready in time. He and Roger (another great guy at the Grill) called to check on our room multiple times. Understand that at no time were we upset. How could we be when we were surrounded, and \"entertained\" by the great staffers we were meeting. Grace is a great lady who is a cashier at the grill. Talking with her is like getting together with an old friend. She was also very kind to us To me, none of the staffers HAD to be kind to us, but they were. Another stand out was Becky, the concierge at the Ocean Tower. Another exceptional Hilton Team member. Friendly, helpful and very generous with her hospitality. She made sure we had everything we needed. On the room service/maintenance side, Mason really took care of us.What a great experience! We were very sad to leave this gorgeous resort and its wonderful hosts. Kudos to the Hilton team for doing such a great job! Management, you should be proud to have these people working there! ", " The resort and facilities were great. We stayed in the lagoon tower which was only a short stroll to everything in the resort and definitely worth paying a little bit extra for. We had an evening meal at the Lagoon Grill which was really nice and reasonably priced compared to the other eateries. We bought lunch on our first day at the Orchid Market Place which was over priced and the food was very average. We found a great shop at the Queens market place which is only a 2 minute drive from the resort on the same road called Island Gourmet market. It is a small convenience store which had heaps of great prepared meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner together with other grocery items. You can also order from their menu board.Make sure you budget for the resort fee and also a parking fee. We had a great time and would go back again as the grounds and setting was amazing. ", " The hotel is a manicured delight - a suburb in itself. Transport using ground monorail or canal/lagoon boats. Hotel rooms clean and spacious, and the bed huge and very comfortable. Plenty of places to eat, drink, be social or simply relax. ", " Huge, huge resort on 60 acres, many pools and the lagoon is beautiful where you will be able to see some fishes and turtles. Can rent canoe, paddle boats, snorkle gear, etc. Pools were not crowded at all 6.12.15 to 6.18.15. Cabana wasn't bad either, prices range from 50-100-200 depending on amenities. First picture was room 5090 at Ocean Tower. 3/4 mile away is a smaller shopping area where you can buy food to go or cook if you want to save some money. Price will be higher than mainland for sure. Lobster was $28/lb, dungeness crab was $26/lb :) Enjoy your future trip. PS, parking 20/day. Resort fee 25/day ", " We really enjoyed our stay here we had a beautiful room overlooking the ocean and golf course yes it's further away from the lagoon tower but it was so quiet and the beds were very comfortable Food was expensive the pizza delivered cost over $50 Aus $ which is too much the lagoon grill we found was good value and food was quite nice We used valet parking as it was just more convenient and worth the extra $5 Breakfast was $30 each which was expensive as we are light eaters so we just went to the shop and got our own supplies Overall very nice resort and would stay here again ", " The resort is massive! but once you've got used to the walking (or catching the train or boat) you're sure to love it.We stayed in room 4311 one of the Makai rooms at the Lagoon Tower overlooking the Dolphin pool, the Lagoon and the sea... amazing view! with the Makai rooms you get priority booking at the restaurants via a dedicated concierge within the Lagoon Tower, a separate sunbed area at the main pool with better beds and access to the Spa (there was maybe more benefits but these were the only we used).There's probably too many features of the hotel to list, and I'm not sure we saw everything in there was to see but the highlights were:The pool area, the pool is large with multiple areas including waterfalls and a hot tub area within a cave-like area. There's plenty of sunbeds around the pool and servers taking drink and food orders wondering around. The Lagoon, for me this was the highlight of the hotel, the lagoon is connected to the sea but it very still so great for paddle boarding, swimming etc. It is full of sea life, various different fish and turtles! it is a great place to snorkel, you can't miss the fish and the variety is huge. Go down in the morning before the masses hit the beach and you'll see loads... we were able to swim with the turtles completely alone.The Dolphins, although they did not do a show with the dolphins you could sit and watch them interacting with people who had payed to swim with them. We could see this from our room but you can also sit in the bar next to them or on a grass bank and watch them do tricks etc. The boat, very novel, taking a the boat ride around the hotel. The train was far more frequent as we only saw the boat once (when we got on it)... it beats walking. There are two shopping areas about a 5-10 min walk up the road, both next to each other, which had most things you would need from high end fashion to food and drink. There is also a shuttle from the hotel to the shops but it's a fairly short walk, as long as you head off in the right direction... but that's another story.We ate in the KPC - Kamuela Provision Company one night, which was very good. Food and service were both excellent, and the view of the sunset from the patio seating is wonderful. It's possible to book tables at the font to get the bets view of the sunset but these were an extra cost, or so we were told. Due to various activities we did this was the only evening meal we had to the hotel, but it was very good and I would recommend going there (at sunset of course).The only regret we had was we didn't spend much time at the hotel due to various activities we had planned, it would have been good to spend a few more day there. From the airport the hotel was about a 30 min taxi ride, which cost about $60. I would recommend arranging a taxi a day in advance of leaving the hotel as it's a bit out of the way so there's not a line of taxis waiting there. Pros- The lagoon!- Pool area- the weathers much better on that side of the island- Lots of shops and places to eat in the resortCons- not the best location for going to the Volcano National Park, we did a tour which took 14 hours in total... long day!- no cabs waiting at the hotel, not a big issue just something to be aware of. ", " This isn't just a hotel, it borders on a theme park. With over ten restaurants and numerous water slides there is no need to actually go anywhere. The only down is that there is no beach. However just a few miles up the road there are a number of magnificent beaches.The hotel complex is massive, yet it never felt busy. The Kohola pool was less crowded and the one we took the children to the most.We would happily return. ", " It's amazing what they were able to create in the area of the Big Island that is really just black lava and very few grasses/plants. The hotel really is an oasis in the desert. Our stay was great from start to finish there and they have done a wonderful job of making it so that you rarely have to leave the property if you don't want. Now keep in mind that this all comes with a price and I truly mean of the $ kind. Hawaii itself is not cheap and the hotel keeps that theme going, but the options you have available are plenty and diverse.Location should be a major thought when choosing this hotel. It is more of a large campus than a single hotel, so your building choice will influence your schedule mainly. By that I mean that it takes a decent amount of time to get from one area to the other. That's why they have multiple transportation options around the complex. If you want away from the hustle, the Ocean tower is great. If you want closer to the lagoon and the larger pool, then the Lagoon tower is where to stay (They charge more per night for those rooms). The Palace tower is a bit closer to the lobby, but still a walk to the actual lagoon area. The room we were in in the Ocean tower overlooked the mini golf course and did have a view of the ocean which was great. It was a hotel room, but definitely and oversized hotel room with 2 beds, a couch, desk etc. and then a kind of separated area into the sink, fridge, walk in closet, and bathroom. Plenty of room actually for our whole family.As far as the transportation options, if it's hot out, then riding the tram is great as it's air conditioned and never packed. The trade off there is that it's slower than it should be really. We stayed in the Ocean tower (furthest away from the hotel lobby) and it was always faster to walk to the lobby than take the tram. But it's along walk in the heat, so we split options there. The boats are a fun way to get around as well. They are a bit faster than the train if they don't have to stop everywhere and give you a lot more choices to get off than the tram. We used all 3 options a bunch depending on weather, time of day, etc. The water channel for the boats is filled with some barracudas and other fish as well so you get to look for them regardless of tram or boat. The choice of restaurants is pretty decent and we ate at the Boat Landing Cantina, the pizza place, the lagoon grill, and the ice cream restaurant. All of them were decent food, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. Again everything is pricey, but not horrible. We went off campus a few times to the restaurants in the Queen's Marketplace and found that they were actually priced pretty similarly for the sit down restaurants. We did not try the breakfast buffet as we thought $30 per person for breakfast was too much for family of 4. But there is a grocery market in Queen's marketplace and fridge in the rooms, so we got breakfast stuff there and ate in a bunch.So on to the highlights of the resort. THE LAGOON!!!!!! The lagoon is a spectacular piece of the property. They built a small \"beach\" on one side of it and have lots of chairs and umbrellas there. We never had any issues getting chairs, but not sure if that was due to the time of year or not. As soon as you put your face in the water almost anywhere in the lagoon you can't help but see many fish. Snorkeling in the lagoon was actually better than any other place we tried around the island. Just amazing. And the turtles/honu typically are swimming in there all day long and love the waterfall area. Never went a day there without running into at least 2 turtles swimming through. We ended up not going diving on the trip because we could just snorkel in the lagoon. Truly the gem of the hotel property. The pools were actually great as well, but we were in the lagoon more than them. They do have a pool near all 3 towers as well as a small adults only pool inside the ocean tower building though. The water slide at the lagoon pool is the best, but they do have a small one at the other pool.Parking is an interesting thing there as well as they have 2 options. Self parking is $25 per day and is a few minute walk from the lobby, so tack that on to your time schedule if you use that. Valet parking is only $5 more per day at $30 and the valet attendants were awesome. Call ahead from your room and your car will be waiting with the windows down when you get there. Just remember to tip them out as they are doing the running down to the parking lots. Now for the tip with that. If you rent a hybrid car then you get free valet parking. So you get free parking, help the environment, save on the gas fill up at the end, and the hybrid was not a lot more than a standard so you come out ahead overall.So the resort was excellent, but you need to know some things going into it to enhance your stay. Rent a hybrid, buy breakfast stuff at the marketplace, be ready to walk a lot, be patient and plan for tram/boat/walking time, and be ready for Hawaii pricing. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village has something for everyone ... and that is not an exaggeration. This mammoth resort offers endless activities for families, couples or groups seeking to get away for a memorable vacation. A very enthusiastic five of five stars.The resort grounds are huge, but blend nicely with the island landscape. The central feature is a tranquil lagoon that features several varieties of fish ... and of course sea turtles. The lagoon is a snorkeler's paradise. The water is calm and inviting, making it perfect for beginners and more advanced (and adventuresome) snorkelers. The lagoon is large enough to comfortably accommodate the thousands of resort guests, and there are paddle boards, water bikes and kayaks for rent. I never felt cramped or crowded at the lagoon the five days we stayed at the resort.The restaurants are located throughout the resort and offer a variety of menu themes and price ranges. Expect to pay $15 - $20 per person minimum for a meal. The food is good, but not exceptional. There are three hotel buildings on the resort grounds. The Lagoon Tower is located closest to the lagoon and main lobby of the resort. The Princess Tower is set back from the ocean and the lagoon. The Ocean Tower is farthest from the lobby and lagoon, but seems closest to the ocean. We stayed in an ocean front room in the Ocean Tower. I was very pleased with our accommodations. The room was large (about 500 square feet), with a comfortable balcony overlooking the pacific ocean. The sunset view was incredible ... and well worth the price. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom small, but efficient, with strong water pressure and plenty of hot water. There is a fridge in the room and a decent sized walk-in closet which was more than sufficient for two large suitcases and duffle bags.You need to walk if you stay at this resort. There is a tram and a boat service which run between the hotel towers and main lobby. However, these people movers are slow and the schedules undefined. I had no issue walking the resort ... and would certainly recommend you not let the size of the resort discourage you from staying. There is too much here to enjoy, so embrace the size of the resort and all it offers.Parking is a $25 per day or $30 for valet. I would recommend self-parking. It seemed like the valet was swamped during peak times in the morning and evening. The walk from the lobby to the self-parking lot is not bad ... and the freedom it affords is well worth the few extra steps.I would also recommend stocking up on water, snacks and beverages at a Kona grocery. Muling these goodies to your room will require some effort, but it will save you $$$ if you do not have to buy these items at the resort. It is not unusual to ride the tram with folks toting cases of beer, water and soda. Finally, I would strongly recommend the Ocean Tower ocean front rooms. The view seemed unmatched by any that the Princess Tower or Lagoon Tower could offer. It is a brisk walk from the lobby ... but well worth the extra steps.This resort is an experience ... and should be your first choice on the island of Hawaii. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is one of those places that makes you question if there are any other hotels in the world like it as you would want to visit each and every one of them. The hotel was designed by the same person that designed Disneyland so they say. This is why you will see a monorailish trains, boats following their own track (zero risk of collision), dolphins, swimming with sea turtles, tropical pools, lagoon, various restaurants to meet everyones taste, etc...The only setback to this place would be the gym that is relatively small compared to the size of the facility. The fact you have to walk 15 minutes back to reception in case your keycard doesn't work is't a pleasure either, the local building reception was never open. Besides this, the place is definitely a worth while visit for couples and families and receives 5/5 from me. ", " My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon dueto a Cyber Monday special. We were absolutely spoiled at this resort compared to the other locations that we booked during our time on the island. We stayed on the fourth floor at the Palace Tower. The room was absolutely incredible. We took full advantage of the balcony for an amazing dinner view. We wandered the resort and enjoyed the sunset views, life size checkers game, amazing pools, and beach. Our room was very nice. However, there wasn't a microwave so we were not able to eat the dinner that we bought. My husband enjoyed the complementary coffee in the room. The resort is huge. We walked most of the time. We only took the monorail once and never used the boat system. There was no noise that disrupted our stay. We were highly impressed with the resort and would definitely return! ", " We have young children and booked this hotel through Costco based on the positive reviews. I was not comfortable having them do the water activities in the open ocean and lagoon worked out very well. we stayed in the lagoon tower which was the best and closest to Lagoon, Dolphins and parking. Something unexpected happened during our trip and my daughter got hurt in a hit and run accident. That changed our plans and she had to use wheel chair. Everyone in the resort was very sensitive to the incident and they took extra steps to make us feel better. Sheldon in the valet parking team was so nice to change our parking from self to Valet at no extra charge without even asking so family can stay together. When we went for breakfast all the servers especially Vanessa took my daughter to seat her on the table before we would register. I am forgetting some other names in the breakfast team who would always cheer us up and help us in whatever way they can to make our stay comfortable. The only issue we had was that we had to walk a lot to go from one place to another as there are steps everywhere. It was hard to take a wheelchair around. I wish they have more wheel chair accessibility in the resort. It was just too much of walking trying to find alternate ways to get around the resort.I would not hesitate a bit to book this resort if especially is you are travelling with young kids. There is so much to do within the resort and you would be happy that you picked this resort as we were all smiling when we left. ", " My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this resort. While initial checkin was a bit concerning, the Hilton Honor clerk was able to resolve any issues quickly! The campus is beautiful on the side of the island and the tram and boat system made getting around fairly simple. I did not attend the initial orientation since we did not find out about it until half way through the week...it may have been beneficial to see what services were available rather than finding about stuff as we heard others talking etc. but a very relaxing week as well as being able to take advantage of the natural parks and events of the island. great week...would return again and again! ", " Hawaii big island is 1 of the most diverse islands in the world. From active volcanoes with hot lava to white sand beaches!Great place to visit. I will say that Hilton waikaloa resort is the best place to stay in the island. It is a great resort with plenty of nice amenities and great sunset views. Staff is very nice, shops, restaurants are all nice. A helicopter ride with blue Hawaiian is one of the best experiences I ever had and highly recommended, our pilot Scott was amazing \u2764\ufe0f ", " An excellent place to relax with huge swimming pools, hot tubs everywhere, a definite 5 star experience! We love this place. It would be a shame to book elsewhere. Recommended for families and people traveling solo. ", " Had an excellent stay and wish we had stayed longer. As per the advise of other reviewers took valet parking for extra $5 and it was very worth. Palace tower Rooms looked little old but very comfortable and didnt have any issues. Walking in the lobby looking at all the beautiful collection sculptures was the best thing and the snorkeling in the lagoon and the peace at Buddha point. ", " The first thing you need to know: it's huge, you're going to walk a lot. Even if you decide to take the monorail everyday (some patience required), the stop is far from your room. The parking lot is just like Disneyworld, it takes a lot of time to get there. Ok, if that's not a problem for you, everything else is very nice: the private beach for snorkelling with the turtles, the asian museum all over the property, having lunch right next to the dolphins and small sharks, rooms are big, well decorated and the breakfast is good. Everything you expect from paying a resort price, but gigantic. Had a great birthday week there. ", " Incredible vacation! Booked through Costco Travel. Right on the ocean with canals running through hotel's enormous grounds. Can take tram or boat to get to destination. Dolphin, sea turtles, exotic birds and fish right on the premises. Landscaping is breathtaking. Hotel personnel helpful and friendly. Would go back in a minute. Highly recommend. Suggest rental car for exploring. Parking is very expensive, $25/day. ", " Like Disneyland with chocolate sprinklesWe stayed in a Makai room again and were right above the dolphin poolsNice view of the ocean tooLarge room that is beautifully presentedFriendly helpful staff and great serviceYes, it is a large resort and yes we love itBreakfasted in our room watching the Dolphins interacting with the staff and then went down to the lagoon and swam with turtles ", " I spent 4 days at the Waikoloa Village for a Romantic get away and Waikoloa delivered 110%, beautiful manicured grounds, every place you turned was amazing with the view and the breath taking view and the amazing art through out the property, the service was outstanding what you expect from being in a Hilton Hawaii property, the food and the restaurants were delicious and was complimented by the service, must go to the fine dining restaurant at the end close to the pool with the breath taking view and sunset, Linda my server was excellent. ", " I love the Hilton Waikoloa on the big island in Kona Hawaii. Aand especially my most recent visit the last few days when I got to stop by the Ocean Tower Concierge desk and \"talk story\" a few times to Emily and Wes. They are so inviting and fun ! They have true Aloha Spirit and are so nice. Took care of me ! Will be back because of Emily and Wes.Cindy ", " Where do you begin? This place is just majestic. From swimming in the lagoon with Turtles, to lounging around in luxury pools, this place has it all. Sunset are amazing from Buddha Point. The boats and tram are both cool, and yes, this place is big enough that you will appreciate having them to get around. I highly recommend this property to anyone looking to stay in the Waikoloa area. ", " We recently enjoyed a week at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island of Hawaii. The property is beautiful and expansive with several pools with waterslides and an awesome lagoon with great snorkeling and paddle boarding. All the hallways are art galleries with impressive Asian and Island themed art. We discovered, with some apprehension that there was a film crew working on a game show. It turned out, they were shooting a kids\u2019 show for Nickelodeon. It became one of the high points of the boys\u2019 vacation. Though they didn\u2019t get to be contestants on the show, they were asked to help out with trouble shooting the games before the contestants played. It allowed my partner and me to spend some time relaxing, while knowing the boys (11 and 13) were in good handsWe even got to be part of the show routing for contestants while they we doing a game in one of the pools.The sunsets were beautiful and the proximity to the village was great. We had some really great meals on and off the property. ", " I want to recognise some people who show some of the best customer service I have had in a long time which is Vanessa who is just lovely she is so friendly, polite and great at her job, I actually felt like I was leaving my home. Then David fanatastic knowledge of all the stories of the Island so interesting and keeps you entertained during breakfast. Both these people work in the waterfront breakfast hall both thier customer service is fantastic unlike anywhere else I've seen.Now for the Hotel at check-in as we are mother and son they had decided prebook us in a twin with one double and one pull out as they could see I was not under the age of 16 without us asking changed us to a twin room with two doubles which was great. Now we were put in Ocean Tower even though the Myna Birds can be quite loud at times I think formthe spacious and modern decor plus a lovely view of the ocean depending on where your room is brilliant with in this tower your a quick walk to three of six restaurants on site.I really enjoyed the L\u00fca\u00fc onsite which was near Lagoon tower then if you want a great view of a Sunset at night while Eating Dinner there is KPC restaurant which with no trees in the way you can watch Nature preform its lovely change over to night.Now you got many areas to sunbathe how you wish but they have two or four pools that are great or there is the man made lagoon to relax by or snorkel and see all the fish or rent anything else they have there. Next to here is the Dolphin quest and the black tipped reef shark brilliant for everyone i think.We also went out on the trolley bus tomthe local shops at kings gate and queens gate which is definitely worth while. I also enjoyed seeing the parrots everyday and my favourite was Marley. Also there are many birds onsite naturally and feral cats and of course the mongoose lol.But overall had an excellent stay and definately would come again. ", " Although the Hilton is huge its ambience changes from one end to the other. From the promontory with Buddha and the overlook of the pacific to the massive pools and the lagoon it has something for every mood. ", " One of my very favorite places to stay on the Kona side of the Big Island. It is right on the beach with its own swimming inlet. About a 30 minute drive from the downtown main strip, a great getaway from too much civilization. The property has everything you need if you don't want to drive. ", " My wife and I have never stayed at this facility only because we stay at another Hilton facility in the area. However, on June 06 we walked over to this facility and looked around. I spend a lot of time traveling on business and when ever I have the opportunity I stay in a Hilton Facility. This facility was very well maintained and beautiful place to bring your family. The swimming pools are excellent and the grounds are perfectly manicured. Again the Customer Service is outstanding and any employees you visit with will cater to your every desire. They have a restaurant called the KPC which is located on the edge of the property and overlooks the ocean. A couple of years ago my wife and I ate there and the ambiance, customer service, and the food were fantastic. We have reservations to dine there on this trip also and I will update you on the restaurant at that time. ", " Stayed here 20 years ago for my fiance's 30th birthday. Came back for our 20th wedding anniversary. What a great time. Room was clean and very comfortable. grounds, pools, paths, lounge chairs, staff, all excellent. Almost wish we'd brought the kids. Almost. ", " We stayed here for 7 nights in May, simultaneously celebrating my daughters college graduation, and our wedding anniversary. We had a very enjoyable experience , and are already looking forward to returning .PROS:1. The grounds. They are just gorgeous. The resort as a whole is laid out to take full benefit from the oceanfront location. The profusion of plants and art bring it into \"over the top\" territory. I was also gratified that the landscape people do not rely on electric tools that would spoil the ambiance.It is nice to see someone with a rake! My one disappointment was a lack of seating, especially around the Ocean tower area, where execpt for two 2-person benches, the only option for sitting and watching the sunset were pricey cabanas.2. The pools and lagoon. Every pool had its own charm, and were well done, however we spent most of our time in the lagoon. We kayaked, snorkeled, and paddle boarded. Do beware of the tide! We made the mistake on our first day of leaving our beachbag on the sand, only to return 30 minutes later, and it was sitting in water. 3. The dolphins. All of the dolphins were born in captivity, and seem content. It was very cool to be able to watch them while eating at the lagoon grill, or sitting on the grassy knoll. If you can't afford to swim with them, you can still spend very quality time observing them.4. The staff. Most we interacted with seemed genuinely friendly. Weirdly the exception was the front desk staff. They could learn from the grounds people and waiters!CONS:1. Nickelodean was filming the entire time we were there, it was weird and inconvenient.2. The food. We prefer to eat healthy, and when the most affordable food on the resort is pizza and grill food, that is hard. The food we did have was tasty, but I would have liked an actual dinner restaurant that was healthy and somewhat affordable. I did boycott the KPC restaurant as I was very irritated that as a Hilton Diamond I could not get access to the tables they reserved for their own private branded top service level. 3. The rooms. Two of my top pet peeves.......storing the towels over the toilet(YUCK), and asking you to reuse your towels but providing one little towel rack! Lastly, where is the clothesline??? You can't provide a place to dry swim suites at a beach resort? On the flipped, we loved the spa-line toiletries, and bought some to bring home. We had an oceanfront room in the Ocean tower, which did provide a breathtaking view, however the ambiance was marred by the putting course being right next to our lanai. The players were having a good time, but the noise made it hard to read etc. ", " Upon making a reservation, we were given a $159 kamaaina (Hawaii resident) room rate, $15 kamaaina resort fee (normally $25) and understood there was an additional $20 fee for self-parking or $25 flat rate fee for valet parking. We did manage to find special $139 room rates in the past, but decided the $159 price would work this time based on great previous stays and the family occasion at hand. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the valet who immediately informed us that our $25 valet fee was waived, because of our sons handicapped placard. We continued to check in and were greeted and helped by the Hilton's always friendly staff. We asked for any type of free upgrade, but due to occupancy none were available. We were given sub-par room choices for our regular rate...or for a $45 upgrade we could move into the newly renovated lagoon tower, located at the main pool and large slide facility and dolphin lagoon. So we decided this was best. When getting into our room we were very happy with the upgrade. Our room on the first floor is beautiful. It included his/hers robes, microwave, (delivered free upon request) two queen beds and a balcony that opens up to the lawn right over the dolphin lagoon with a full ocean view and easy access to the main pool, train and boat trolley. Once again we are glad we returned to the Hilton Waikoloa and are glad to recommend this great family resort to all! Aloha! ", " This resort was huge. It had something for everyone. We stayed in the Ocean Tower, which is the furthest tower from anything. There is a train tram and boat that run and the longest you really wait is maybe 10 minutes at the longest. We actually enjoyed the walk although a long walk it was beautiful. The grounds are beautiful, the lagoon was awesome and it was crazy swimming with the sea turtles. We were there for 5 nights and still feel like we did not get to see everything. There are 2 golf courses and plenty to do. Highly reccomend taking the trolly to the market and purchasing snacks and booze, otherwise you will spend a fortune buying at the resort. Lava Lava beach is also a cool place to hang out and relax, during the day and at night. We ate ate Kirin Chinese restaurant, Kohala pool bar, and Dona & Toni's. I thought Doni and Toni's was the best. While we were there we went sport fishing with High Noon Charters in Kona, Took a 2 hour helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian Helicopters and a walking tour of the volcano. ", " This hotel was the best hotel we have ever stayed in from the front desk to the people that cleaned the rooms. the resort is massive, but transportation within the resort solves that albeit a little slow. Restaurants were great, spa was great, lagoon, pools everything perfect. Needed a micro wave no problem called 0 and got one immediately. This is Hilton at its finest. Snorkeling with turtles, and my husband was early morning snorkeling when he looked over and beside him was an endangered Hawaiian Monk seal, he didnt know at the time that it was endangered, they looked at each other and he knew enough to stay clear. he swam to the shore and was told by a member of Sea Quest who had also spotted the seal that he did the right thing. We then were able to observe this magnificent creature and take pics from the beach. Were told only 7 anywhere in Hawaii and there are several hundred world wide. Truly a once in a lfetime experience. Everything here is clean they sweep the concrete walkways!! they dust the art that is outside. The pizza restaurant is great Italian food as well. We watched the dolphins frolic and play. Did not want to leave. they allowed us to use the spa to shower before heading home.the power went out for a couple of hours one morning and its funny but I didnt even care ", " We received a great rate on our room at the Hilton, the place is gorgeous! We loved our stay, loved the resort and will return. My only complaint is the overpriced food and drinks within the resort. Breakfast buffet was $30 per person, and a dry turkey sandwich for lunch was $15. They get you once you are there, don't be fooled by the room rate deal. There is a small refrigerator in the room, which we utilized after the sticker shock. Just keep that in mind when staying here. Had a wonderful vacation, and absolutely loved the setting, pure paradise! ", " This was my 2nd stay here and again it did not disappoint. The only issue that we had was that they were filming some sort of movie and the pools were closed. This was not too big of an issue as we did activities off of the resort instead. Everything about the resort is beautiful. The have multiple swimming pools, a salt water lagoon, a swim with the dolphins, a tram system, and a canal system. The art work around the resort is beautiful. I would definitely stay here again. ", " We recently stayed at this hotel for seven nights and it was a perfect visit. This is our second visit since 2001 and it is still an awesome hotel. The best on the island for us. Both times our room was on the sixth floor of the Lagoon Tower (Makai) and this is a perfect location. The breakfast buffet is perfect and a typical price for the island and was a short walk from our room. The restaurants we used were all very good food and service. The amenities and the room were great. All the free water we wanted and a fridge to chill it in. You have to walk the pathways from one end to the other and back, there is so much to look at. You won't believe all the art, sculptures, etc. that are on display. Then you have to ride the boats in the canal and the electric train with air cond. The swimming pools are terrific, the lagoon with equipment rentals is terrific. And don't forget the Dolphin pools and the great views and sunsets! You will be busy trying to do everything that is available. Have a blast! ", " We came here for our honeymoon and enjoyed every single minute. It's a fantastic resort, great food, great rooms. We had the most relaxing time and even made some friends. We plan to go back soon. We did the dolphin experience and loved it! The pool was great too, loved being able to drink by the pool also. Breakfast was delicious, always an array of fresh fruits. ", " My best friend and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on The Big Island Of Hawai'i from May 15th through the 21st. What an awesome place to stay and enjoy the East side of the island! The resort is gigantic but not hard to manuever around with the trams and boats available to ride. However, walking is another good way to get around the resort as well. We enjoyed the dolphins, flamingos, green sea turtles and lots of types of birds. Our favorite place we named \"Paradise Point\" next to the Ocean Tower. We relaxed and sunned on the cabanas available at the point while taking in the beauty of the Pacific Ocean and lava rocks! The Kings and Queens Shopping Areas were also really nice!! ", " My mother and I stayed here for a week. We bought the dining card ( $35) which gave 2x $10 coupons and 10% food and drink. Our room rate also included $50 per day resort credit. The rooms ( ours was in the Ocean Tower) were good. The landscaping was outstanding with lots of art work and great ocean and sunset views. The pools were very good and never felt too crowded.The breakfast buffet was reasonably priced given the location. Kirin the chinese restaurant was very good.We took the shopping trolley ( every 20mins and $2pp to the Queens Market Place for lunch ( the Island Gourmet market was very good ( on some days they had a cheeseburger, fries and a large drink for $7. The fitness centre in the Lagoon tower was good (they had some machines in the garden court yard room but the room was hot. However the main fitness room was a lot cooler. I swam with the turtles in the manmade lagoon ( I bought flippers and snorkels from ABC in HNL to save rental costs). Shaka cones close to the Dolphin lagoon was good. Played on the mini golf course ($10). We booked a Roberts tour of the Big Island that took all day and was worthwhile. A minor downside in the Ocean tower was the birds making a lot of noise in the morning.Whilst food is a little expensive you can save money by having lunch at the Queens Market place and buying water/juice/soda etc there.It is a beautiful resort but due to the size you will need to walk some distances or may have to wait for the tram and/or boats ( boats run less frequently) and we loved the hotel ", " We stayed here our last two nights on the Island after a 14-Day 2-Island Adventure. After all the running around we did, we looked forward to just hanging out and relaxing and the Hilton did not disappoint. The grounds are beautiful and are easily accessed via paths, boat and tram. The only negative I could say from the entire trip was the cost of food. The food at the resort was outrageously priced and the one restaurant we did try did not impress and portions were small. Even the ice cream in the gift shop was $5 a piece. So if you have a car, head out for your meals. The lagoon was nice to hang out in with plenty of loungers. We did snorkel here but visibility was poor (which we expected) but there were about six turtles in the Lagoon so that was neat to be able to swim with them in the Lagoon. Nightly walks on the grounds made we wish we could of stayed longer at the resort. Would stay here again when on the Big Island. ", " Cant say enough about this property. One of the few hotels where one can truly say you still experience a true taste of Hawaii. there is so much to do that a full week could be dedicated to never leaving the property. So I'd suggest taking at least 2 weeks to appreciate all the island has to offer. ", " Stayed at the beautiful Hilton Waikoloa Village for 5 nights in May. What I loved - Great pools - Spacious and cool and comfortable rooms (lagoon tower) - Resort offerings- my son loved the train and the boat that transfer you between towers. They are consistent times despite previous reviews saying they are not - Best Pizza at Toni and Dona's - Buffet Breakfast is delicious - Grounds are beautiful - Lovely Hawaiian charm! As a family we just had to be organised - go the to the ABC store and stock up on little comforts for your room eg milk, juice, nappies etc so you do not have to go to an outlet each time. The shuttle can take you to the local shops every 15 mins or so.. did not find great dinner restaurants in the Waikoloa shops. Good for breakfast , quick Lunch but for nice dinners stick to the Hilton offerings. Just do your research pick the room that suits your liking and circumstance eg near a kids pool or adults only area and plan your days so your not spending too much time wondering from location to location as this can take up a good part of a day. Pick your spot and go! Enjoy and Mahalo Hilton Waikoloa! ", " Our Rotary International District 5000 recently held its annual conference at the Hilton Waikaloa. I am a Rotarian and was asked to provide our award winning 100% Kona coffee to our Rotarian guests from around the state. Heavenly Hawaii Farms represented the Kona coffee district. There were three other farms from the Ka'u district at the south end of the Big Island. We were all very favorably impressed with the extraordinary service we received from staff in setting up booths as well as the general conduct of the three day conference, Can't say enough about the exceptional care we received from the Hilton staff. Absolutely extraordinary. Recommend the Hilton Waikaloa for any business or charitable organization convention. ", " Hopefully this is not a \"once in a lifetime\" vacation because I want to come back and I would want to stay right here again. This property is breathtaking gorgeous. The views are spectacular. My family and I enjoyed walking around this massive resort exploring, shopping, and eating at some of the restaurants. When you get used to the different paths its not that complicated getting from one side to the other. If you're in a hurry there is always the tram to get you back and forth. You may also take the boat however you do have to wait slightly longer for one to come around. We usually rode the boat at evening time for a relaxing activity. I highly suggest the valet parking. It's only 5 dollars more per day and much more convenient than lugging all your stuff up the hill and up the stairs to the lobby. The parking crew has this down to a science, brings your car to you in a matter of minutes, has the air condition on, and opens the door. Relaxation is why we vacation and to have this kind of service was well worth the extra. We tipped about 3 bucks each time they brought our car to us or parked for us and they were always very appreciative. Watch them during busy time. Very interesting. They work their booties off. You never see them just walking. On our next to last day we inquired about a late check out as our flight leaves very late at night. Regular check out is noon. If you ask, they will give you until 2 pm at no charge, store your luggage, then gives you a \"clean up\" room (no charge) to shower up before you leave. Makes it nice if you want to squeeze in that one last activity.The only negatives...our room served its purpose and was clean but very outdated. I believe they are remodeling in our building as you can see furniture pushed out on the balconies of select floors. We had 4 people in our room but only got 3 towel set replacements everyday even though we would go to the desk daily to remind them. We stayed in Ocean Tower room 2042 ground floor. You get a slight view of the ocean if you look to your left and a dead on view of the golf course from the back patio. During the night either the grounds maintenance or the remodeling crew park their trucks right outside our door.  Oh, and one more thing...every morning and night there are approx 11 cats that come to the back door which was fine with us. My daughter, being the animal lover she is, spent her souvenier money on cat food. We have left the leftovers on the back patio on the table for the next guests. Whether or not housekeeping will remove it is the million dollar question. Enjoy!! ", " We had so much fun here! You can walk to your room or take a tram or boat. The pool area is enormous with waterfalls, several hot tubs, and a sandy kids area. The lagoon is open to the ocean, so there were several sea turtles swimming around and different colorful fish. You can lounge on the beach, snorkel or rent a kayak, paddle boat, or paddle board. You can enjoy lunch and ice cream while watching the dolphin play at Dolphin Quest or watch the shark swim around in their space. The hotel has over 1800 museum artifacts and a mini-zoo like area with flamingo, turtle, and Ne Ne. You have a choice of several restaurants to eat at on site or you can go a short distance to nearby restaurants. Our room was in the newly renovated lagoon tower and was very comfortable. Beautiful scenery! ", " This beautifully located hotel is also a beautiful resort with pools, lakes, lagoons, fish, birds, train rides and boat rides. Although walking between buildings is easy, there is a train and boats if you want to just sit and ogle the passing scenery. Numerous places to eat good food on and off the site. ", " This hotel has a special feeling. The employees have been trained in a way that makes you think like the Maya Angelou saying, \"I've learned people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them FEEL!\"One conceirge agent definitely exemplied this consistently everyday I talk to her by making me feel special. But honestly everyone here really went out of their way to go the extra mile. The resort itself also has a dolphin pool, a lagoon where you can swim and paddle boat with turtles, walk on romantic trails and amazing pools and restaurants. I love the big facility because it really lets you get lost in a world of imagination.Mahalo for the amazing feeling and imagination of true paradise!!!! ", " This is a very large complex with beautiful landscaping. Yes, if you are in the Ocean Tower, it is a fairly long walk to the lobby. However, we like to stay there and get some exercise, so we love it. The tram runs often but the boats not as often. The staff is very friendly especially the concierges and the staff at the Malolo Lounge. This is a resort in Hawaii, so restaurant prices are higher than you might experience at home - standard as a resort here. A downside is that parking and resort fees add close to $50 per day. Many other resorts do the same, so be aware. We go back every year for 20+ years - it must be more than just OK. ", " Although about 40 min from downtown Kona, this resort has so much to do. Pools and slides everywhere on this expansive property. Rooms are beautiful, and if you have kids, it's amazing. A tram, or even little boats (on rails) take you all over the property. Love this place so much, we come just for weekend staycations every few months. Great with kids but also without. ", " The Hilton Hotel at Waikoloa Village in Kona, Hawaii has remained a Fairy Tale in spite of its age- making it a magic experience for all, including seniors. You will be taken to your room by either train, boat, or you go on foot thru a museum walkway. Your room has all the customary Hilton chic: Comfortable beds, spacious sitting area, well lit desk, clean bathrooms. Most time you may wish to spend outside. There are numerous pools in all shades of blue, some with waterfalls, some with slides used by everyone, some calming and for adults only. You can even swim with dolphins if your conscience permits.The architecture of the hotel is grand kitsch with huge columns, wide staircases, imperial horserace sculptures and a multitude of Asian statues. While not exactly enveloping you in Hawaiian atmosphere, the hotel is vast and interesting enough to keep you entertained for days without venturing out. I love to visit there at least once a year for a few days of tacky exuberance. ", " This place is huge. That's actually the only downside. There is a lot of walking. You do have the option of taking a tram, but that takes about the same amount of time as walking to your destination. It doesn't matter, though, because everywhere you go there is something to capture your attention. Whether the beautiful scenery of the Hawaiian coast or the art that adorns every passageway in the resort, there is always a welcome view around every corner. ", " We stayed here for two weeks and it was absolutely incredible. Great view, great room, great value. We had a nice big room. Staff friendly and perfect, service oriented. If you stay here, you've GOT to do the night snorkel with the Manta Rays in front of the Sheraton in Kailua Kona. Here's a great tip: Save yourself $125 a person and launch from the beach by yourself to swim out to the mantas. We did this and were rewarded with unlimited swim time...3 hrs with them! We are all accomplished free divers, so we were able to dive down with them into the depths, lots of great pictures.The pools are so huge and beautiful at the hotel. Love the lagoon. Great spearfishing in the lagoon outside of the man made one, the actual lagoon.The layout is a little strange in that there are no parking lots adjacent to the room towers, but no big deal when the grounds are so spacious, manicured and beautiful. We'll return. ", " Huge resort located 30 minutes from Kona Airport. We have a 2 1/2 year old son and this resort was his dream. Boats, Trams, Dolphins, lagoons, waterslides, paddleboards, etc, this resort has it all. If you are looking for a place to check in and not have to go anywhere the Hilton Waikoloa is your spot.Great- The resort is like being in Disneyland if you are with kids, going everywhere is an adventure. Staff are very nice, and the food was a pleasant suprise. Good- The rooms are spacious, a bit dated but very clean, adequate and functional. Wifi was fast and easy to connect to.Bad - FEES (resort fee Ok, but a parking fee on top of it, come on)Ugly- Self parking - Its a long walk to get to, always hard to find a spot and you are paying top dollar for the experiance. ", " Our Hilton Waikoloa experience was everything we dreamed of and even more! Hubby had a conference at a resort about 15 minutes away but we landed incredible rates for an even more incredible room at the Hilton and loved every minute of it. The Palace Tower has impressive views on all sides (unless you don't like golf)- we were on a corner and got ocean views, resort views and a bit of a golf view. The trams and the boats are wonderful for getting around but it was just as much fun to hike and see all of the amazing artwork. This place is an art gallery on top of being a top tier resort. So many restaurants to choose from, our favorite was Kamuela Provision Co (we had eaten there on previous Big Island trips and it didn't let us down both suppers we had this trip). The pizza/Italian place was cute, cozy and affordable- perfect when we didn't want to get all gussed up after a warm 18 holes that afternoon. We didn't have reservations and it was a nice meal. Not the best wine list but you don't go there for that. We didn't try the Asian themed restaurants so no review there. The dolphins were nice to see but we didn't put the $$ into the hands-on experience. I SO enjoyed the hula lesson I took through the resort- what a great learning experience and just a heck of a lot of fun! (I think I moved my hips better than the 10 year old next to me...) This is a pricey resort but if you can find a deal it is worth it. We had a huge lanai that we fell asleep on almost every single night under the stars and swaying palm trees. You could hear the tram down below but otherwise it was very private and very wonderful!Great location, about 30 min from the Kona airport and 2 awesome golf courses right in the Waikoloa village. We also found a more local golf course up Makalei and highly recommend that as well! ", " My partner and I stayed here for four nights, along with my brother and sister-in-law who had stayed here before. As other reviewers have noted, this resort is massive! The trams operate quite often and are an easier option than walking from the lobby to your room. We only took the boat once as they do not operate as often and are very slow. We stayed in the Palace Tower which was quite outdated in appearance, however was clean and sufficient given we hardly stayed in the room! Did have a few housekeeping issues i.e. Bed not made upon check in, towels and toiletries not replaced, etc. You pay a premium price for any room here but you are paying for the facilities, not the room. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night as we had booked the restaurant with the sunset view (not sure of name) but they were not serving any hot food due to the exhaust fan breaking down, so provided a discount voucher for any other restaurants on the resort. The pizza was one of the best I have ever had and a very generous serving size. All at dinner enjoyed their meals. Loved the lagoon snorkeling (gear hire is $10 an hour). Plenty to see including quite a few turtles. The pools are fun too, especially the one with the big slide. The dolphins are another attraction and although their pools look small, it appears they are well looked after. A beautiful resort and lovely to just walk around. Will stay here again if we come back to the Big Island! ", " This resort is truly amazing, we had an awesome time, staff were great. The Hilton experience, was enhanced by Ryan (Assistant Director Front Offices Operations), who was able to provide assist when required. Ryan's attention to detail was much appreciated, and supports the Hiltons commitment to consumer service. The breakfast package had awesome variety and was throughly enjoyed. ", " Thank you to those who made reviews that preceded us. We learned a lot:1. Stay at the Towers, best location, also next to pool & lagoon2. Ask for Ocean view (make sure in confirmation). 3. Use Costco for best deals to this hotel (breakfast, etc.) (You might want to compare to AAA or AARP rate etc. (note: Cancellation date---insurance is extra, expensive) 4. What I can pass on: Shortcuts to breakfast or Dolphin or Lagoon (take stairs from Ocean side second floor, one way to Dolphin/Lagoon/other to Breakfast go to fourth floor, cross over, and either go down stairs or take elevator\u2014up-to-you, short cut to main area.) Learn the routine of tram/boat\u2014see electric marquees (often walking is faster) Go down early for coffee/whatever & bring back to room Maids will do you favors ,if you are nice to them, don\u2019t complain Tip well at pool bar/waiter---they remember! (Last day, major conference took over breakfast, pool, lagoon--- --call hotel to find out if major conference date you want to stay here. those days. Not Costco/Booking agent---Hotel knows & will tell you\u2014)Go to public beaches, also leave hotel for better food and price, but for convenience, don\u2019t complain about the cost of hotel food.Remember, this hotel is basically for the kids enjoyment\u2026(yes,they have weddings, but this is a \u201cfamily place.\u201d) ", " If you visit the big island, you will see the glorious Mauna kea and Mauna Loa, the lava caves, and the breath-taking scenery. But to experience the luxury of the island, you must stay in the luxurious Hilton Waikoloa.This hotel has a very open design to give you the taste of the ocean breeze. The hotel offers everything that you would need to enjoy your stay on the island; luaus, water parks, and easy access to the soft sanded beach.While the price may be expensive, if you use your time to the fullest, you can make ever-lasting memories. Stop by Costco on the way there from the airport so you can have a quick meal in your hotel before experiencing the day. ", " There really isn't a \"bad view\" in the hotel! It's great for families but also couples! You can shop at the many hotel area shops or take a shuttle to the King's or Queen's shops! There is a small room refrigerator with plenty of room to grab some extra drinks or food too! The market at the Queen's shops has almost anything you may want! If you're looking to layout on the beach daily, this isn't the place. They do however have a small area with beach and the ocean friends are always welcome! Aloha! ", " Perfect vacation for couples or families. On site dining can get a little pricey, but there is a lot to do on the grounds and plenty of island to drive to. Make sure you spend extra to get the Makai treatment. It is worth it. ", " We stayed for a week... Best family trip ever! The resort is VERY family friendly. I have a 1yr old and a 5yr old. The lagoon was perfect for both of them. Everyone is so friend. We stayed in Ocean tower. We might stay at Lagoon Tower next time because it is closer to everything but ocean tower had a great view. Get a package deal through Costco and you get Big breakfast included (plus a car) and it is totally worth it! Great Breakfast! Plus with the car you can explore the island an go to the volcano (a must see!). You can also go into Kona and have great Poke at Umekes! We wouldn't hesitate to take this trip again! ", " We stayed just two knights . We did not want to leave . They put us in the Ocean tower , Deluxe ocean view. The view was spot on , just breath taking . The room was nice size .(and huge compared to the cruise ships). Nice to have a iron and good safe , plenty of hangers . The coffee maker could be a bit bigger though, we like to bring our own coffee , it makes a little hard to brew with the one cup brewer. Quite rooms and great beds,did not even hear our neighbors or the people above us . unlike some of the other hotels on the big isl. There is so much to do just ask. The cabana we rented was a great touch #7 by the ocean tower any closer you would be in the ocean.They brought us ice water all day . or you can order lunch ., Or stay and watch the sun set. A lot different places to eat . I thought that the food was good bet could be better for the price you are charged, There a Island market store (ABCstore)that has a great deli even prime rib they slice fresh for you, it is just short walk from the Hotel . AT the hotel you can take the trams , or you can choose to walk and see all the wonderful art.. The art is awesome.Glad to see the boats running again . I wold let the bell hope take your luggage to your room you will be more relaxed. I found that the lagoon tower is fully renovated which they call the MAKAI . Cant wait to go back . O all the people were so nice ", " Loved our stay here. Room overlooked the ocean. Slept with door open listening to the ocean Watched the sunset from our balcony. Breakfast was delicious, service excellent with large selection of foods. Valet parking was efficient and worth the extra $5. Room comfortable, clean, quiet and peaceful. Great place to stay and would stay here again. ", " We stayed at the Ocean Tower, with an ocean front view and it was absolutely amazing. We the views were incredible, and it was away from the kids area. The property is large, but it was easy to get around and take advantage of all that the resort had to offer. I would highly recommend staying in the Ocean Tower. ", " Our favorite resort here on the Big Island. Has a ton of activities, pools and restaurants. Beach area is great for a family to relax and swim. Also has snorkel and paddling rentals. Every type of food available there within the resort itself. If you are looking for cheaper eats, you can take a short walk down to the Queen's Shops at the food court or ABC store. Rooms have always been extremely comfortable and clean. Stayed several times now in the Ocean Tower. Staff is always helpful and ready to answer any questions. Zero problems with wifi and it was extremely fast. Pools are always relaxing and there are many of them there.Great place to watch the whales during the winter. Lastly, looking to catch a great sunset? Head over to the Ocean tower area all the way past the putting greens.The only real negative to the resort is the expense for basic items, like bottled water and such. Best thing to do is stop at the ABC store before you get to the resort and stock up on some things. ", " We had a wonderful birthday celebration for my granddaughter. The property was complete with dolphins for her delight. The staff was more than accommodating and even sent a custom made baby birthday cake just for our girl.Many thanks to all the staff, especially Kelly at the front desk, for making our stay one to really remember. ", " This hotel is like the Disneyland of Hawaii. So fun, on site there is a monorail and boats that take you from one end of the property to the other. The pools, the slides, hot tubs....there is a dolphin area, controlled ocean experience with pedal boast and standup paddle boards. The buffet breakfast is amazing !!!! ...all the dining spots are great. The rooms are clean and fresh. I just found out there is a free shuttle to a beach 5 mins away...and the beach has a outside bar and other things. All in all, its a fantastic place to stay !!!! ", " Great for families. Tram and boat service around the large resort is appreciated but we preferred to walk to enjoy the grounds and see the turtles up close in the lagoon. The staff are very friendly. Rooms were very spacious for our extended family trip. Lots of restaurants on site but all very expensive ($100 for two large pizzas and 3 soft drinks delivered to the room). The resort is remote and the shopping nearby is for the resorts so bring your wallet. You do have to pay for basic water toys or equipment, would be nice if this was just available like most resorts. Still, a beautiful resort and location. Spoil yourself with a tour to the volcano from one of the many providers. It is well worth the cost. ", " We stayed at the Hilton in late March/early April for the Lavaman Triathlon and as part of our spring break vacation in Hawaii. Prior to coming to the Big Island, we spent 11 days on Kauai. We flew Hawaiian Airlines with a stop on Maui. We had been to the Big Island 2 years before and stayed south of Kona, but fell in love with the lushness and manicured area of Waikoloa. The Hilton is located in its own little area of the Waikoloa resort, basically at the back of the resort area, and man is it huge. The resort is truly a \"village\". I'll break down my review into parts.Room: We stayed in a Makai room, which is in the Lagoon Tower. It is closest to the lobby, main pool area, spa, Dolphin Quest, and the main shopping area. You have many perks with the room, including a larger room, turn-down service, access to the spa, spa products, views of the ocean, lagoon, and pool, as well as priority reservations at the resort restaurants and an exclusive concierge and check in desk. The bands are neat and are a great way to avoid having to get those annoying plastic pool bands. I do not regret the Makai rooms-- they're worth every penny. The location is so convenient and the view is amazing. We never used the spa, so I can't say anything about that. Our room was on the top floor, and we had an awesome view; we really enjoyed watching the dolphins swim in the lagoon. You get what you pay for. The only problem we had was that we couldn't get our room to cool down-- it was always so hot!Pools: There are 3 main pool areas: the Kona Pool, the Kohala Pool, and the Ocean Tower Pool. The Kona Pool is the largest and most popular. There you have several hidden hot tubs, a cave system, and a large waterslide. This was our favorite area. The Kohala Pool is a river system made up of around 5? pools with slides that connect them. This is a nice, quieter area, but there were a lot of little kids and it was really far from our room. The large waterslide there also wasn't working. There aren't a ton of food options there either. The Ocean Pool is adult only and we did not use it. There were plenty of lounge chairs at all the pools we used. Restaurants: We ate at the Lagoon Grill, the Japanese place (Imari), the Boat Landing Cantina (mexican) the Orchid Marketplace, and Don and Toni's Pizza. You can buy a card that's $15-30 that gives you a percentage off of your food-- it easily pays for itself. The Lagoon Grill has a huge variety and I was extremely impressed by all of the food there. The orders of fries are huge and you get to enjoy watching the dolphins. Can't go wrong there. Imari was quite good, but extremely overpriced. The Boat Landing Cantina was ok, you can go there if you like, but I wouldn't really recommend it. The service was horrible and the food wasn't that great. Don and Toni's pizza was pretty good, but the service was horrendous. We waited 30 minutes to get seated, only for the waitress to screw up our order. We were there for over 2 hours and didn't really get to enjoy our pizza. They did take 25% off our order, but really? They didn't really offer to get us anything-- they just let us sit there and wait-- not even a refill! I wouldn't recommend the Italian sodas either-- they were gross. We also ate breakfast-- the buffet was great and the kids loved the molasadas! Lagoon: There is no real beach at the hotel, just lava rock and some shells/smaller rocks. However, the hotel has dug a huge man-made saltwater lagoon that is fed by the ocean. This allows fish and especially turtles to come into the lagoon. However, it is dirty and churned up. The hotel has created a beach with chairs, but I wouldn't spend my time there-- drive to a beach like Hapuna-- its only 10 minutes away. Size: Yes, the resort is enormous. So big that there are trains and boats to take you around. Sadly, these both seem to never be there when you need them. The hotel either needs to use more boats ALL DAY or speed up the trams. However, if you don't mind walking, its like a museum throughout the property. Just be aware. It does allow for people to sprawl out throughout the property, and the ocean lawn near the ocean tower is an amazing place to sit and watch the whales and the ocean. Most of the chairs are free, so enjoy it!Location: This is probably my favorite location on the Big Island. The property is close to the best beaches (Mauna Lani, A-Bay, Hapuna) and the best shopping (Queen and Kings shops) on the island. I can't stress enough how great the shopping is. I didn't think Kona is that great of a place, so you aren't really missing anything being 45 minutes away. You are also close to the Pololu Valley and not too far away from a day trip to Hilo.Lava Man: The resort did an excellent job hosting the race; they made sure to not let the race impact the guests staying there. Props to them.Conclusion: This is pretty much a family's paradise, truly the Disneyland of Hawaii. It's so huge that people of all types can enjoy themselves here. If you want something a little bit smaller of a scale, try the Sheraton Kona. We love it there too. We would definitely return. ", " We booked our room specifically to ensure we got a renovated room...the discount packages out there were SURE to get us stuck in the kind of tired outdated room other reviews noted (you get what you pay for here). We were also pleasantly surprised that it was extremely easy to get around...we never used the train or the boat...just WALK, people...the pathways along the oceanside are well maintained and the amazing views are what we came for, right? Even our 10 year old never complained about walking from the main pool too the lagoon to the smaller pool. The only complaint is the pool was a bit on the chilly side. We LOVED the lagoon and took full advantage of the rentals to SUP and snorkle...until a Hawaiin Monk Seal came in and limited what we could do in the water. It was wonderful to see this endangered creature! We did the Dolphin Quest package that included snokeling and dolphins. TOTALLY worth it. We rented both the small cabana and the big one, both were reasonablly priced (compared to what we've paid other places). Rentels were a bit high but not bad. The food, as expected, was low quality and high priced. We had a rental car and got some amazing food in Waimea just up the road.We felt the Luau was overpriced, had low quality food and served only as a check in the \"hawaiian luau\" box. Never again, anywhere.Would totally come back and would recommend the resort for sure. ", " Our room overlooked the dolphin area and the ocean. The dolphins were fun to watch and the ocean was beautiful to look at and to listen to the waves. The ocean fed lagoon was great. First, it was warmer than the pools, but the great sandy beach and clear water made it enjoyable to just swim or snorkel as there were fish, turtles, and even a seal. I think this would be great with small children who want to play in the sand and see little fishes swim by without the crash of waves knocking them off their feet. As for the transportation around the resort, the boat ride around sunset was beautiful. The distance between different venues really isn't great unless you have a disability. I enjoyed the walk as the walkway was a museum of Hawaiian culture. The food was excellent. Our stay came with the breakfast buffet at which we filled up for the day until supper with maybe a light soup snack in between. We had dinners at Kirin, Imuri, and the lauau and all were delicious. Someone else mentioned the carpet in their room wasn't tacked down in all the places and we most have had the same room as it looked the same, but really didn't bother us. No place to hang your wet bathing suits was more of a problem to me. I guess you were to hang them outside, but it was windy enough, I didn't want them to blow any. Yes we would come back here. ", " As usual my husband and I read the reviews of hotels before we book. He and I were a little concerned about choosing this property because even though most people give it favorable reviews, others are not very happy with it. I had chosen a room rate that was putting us in the Ocean Towers, which seems to be the least favorite. It is the oldest Tower of the property, if I am not mistaken. We were using Hilton Honor Points, so it was really a no brainer for us, but we were still concerned. When we travel we love properties that have a new feel to them, clean, and are appealing to the eye and well taken care of. This property fit all my criteria to the tee. I absolutely loved it! It was AMAZING! The Resident Manager, Mr. Amos, made sure that we had the best Anniversary ever, and we did! We got an upgrade to an Ocean View room in the Ocean Tower's 6th floor. The view was breath taking and the room was lovely. The decor was beautiful and everything looked fresh and clean. \"Happy Anniversary\" was written with little pebbles on our bed. It was a nice little touch that I had never experienced before. As Hilton Honor Gold Members we are used to the nice amenities that come with the title. Many of the Hilton properties have the Executive Lounges which give you a Continental Breakfast during your stay when you are a HH Gold Member. This Hilton no longer has one, but they offered $20 in food vouchers per day, per room which could be redeemed for the Continental Plate which included fresh fruit, a muffin and a drink, or you could use it anywhere in the property for food.  The grounds were immaculate. The dolphins, turtles and Monk Seals were so much fun to sit and gaze at. We also had so much fun snorkeling in the lagoon and seeing so many turtles. We were happy to walk everywhere since we love to walk, but they also had their monorail and boats to take you around the property. Some people complained about wait times on the reviews, but we never saw anyone waiting more than 5 minutes and they seemed to run very frequently. We loved hearing children laughing as they got to ride in the boats. The pools were so nice and they were never crowded since there are so many. The food is pricey, but what resort does not have pricey food. The $30 Breakfast Buffet was delicious. I especially enjoyed the warm Malasadas. This hotel was on my Bucket List and did not disappoint at all. I loved every minute of our stay. Thank You Hilton Waikoloa Village for such a memorable stay. Everyone of your staff we came in contact with was warm, courteous and professional. Thank You! ", " We got what we thought was a good deal through Costco travel, but were a bit wary, as we'd read reviews about high on-resort prices. Our 5-night package included breakfast coupons, car rental, Makai concierge service, and a luau. My wife had just had ankle surgery, and was wearing a boot, so not as ambulatory as she'd like. We were sincerely impressed by the genuine concern Koano (auto parking valet), Frida (front desk) and Eric (bellman) showed toward us. For a little more money, we got an upgraded room with an ocean view in the Lagoon Tower, and that made a huge difference for us. It's truly a fabulous 62-acre resort. Amazing landscaping throughout the property. No detail overlooked. The swimming pools, with waterfalls, were outstanding. Hot tubs abound. ", " Hilton Waikoloa is a wonderful place and is a resort type place with so much to offer from beautiful landscapes, pools and a beautiful Lagoon. Dolphin Quest is wonderful to watch the trainers work with the Dolphins up close. I haven't swam with them yet but it looks really fun. ", " This is our favorite Hilton property and just a spectacular resort. It has to be one of the best values for your money considering the facility. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a great experience and can't wait to go back again. ", " Secluded resort with a beautiful golf course. Had a wonderful time. Enjoyed the peace and quiet. Adult pool was a plus. Can't wait to go back. There a no street lights so the stars just light up the sky. Beds were very comfortable. ", " We recently stayed at this hotel for the second time in less than 12 months. Last time, we had trouble with getting help and some attitude from staff as well as long lines, etc. This time, the service was much improved, the staff were very helpful and accommodating, and except for the crib all of our requests upon arrival were present in our room as requested. I called and the crib was delivered within a few minutes. My parents who were traveling with us felt that there was too much walking from tram stops to their room in the Ocean tower. Otherwise the hotel was excellent. It would improve intra-resort transit if more of the boats ran between tram times and all possible boat stops were open. ", " This stay was our second stay at Waikola, that in itself says something. The first time was with our kids, this time just my wife and I. We thoroughly enjoy the resort and love the lagoon. It is so relaxing if not a little captive. I highly recommend getting a rental car as it is isolated and it's nice to mix it up with visits to Kona and elsewhere. The resort is BIG but you certainly feel private and looked after. The last room we were in was getting a little tired but the location, sunsets and views make up for any internal views. Can't wait to come back ", " We stayed at this huge, beautiful resort for 10 days and enjoyed it immensely. Our stay was during the off season, so we didn't have the crowds that others have described. The weather was perfect during our entire stay. Service was outstanding - EVERYONE worked to ensure our stay was wonderful. We had an ocean front room in the Ocean Tower (OT), which was at the opposite end of the resort from the main lobby and shops (that was OK with us). Regarding costs, you just have to reconcile yourself to the fact that you're in Hawaii and everything's more expensive here than it is at home. Otherwise, you won't be able to enjoy yourself for worrying over the money.GETTING AROUND: Bring your walking shoes. There's a covered walkway (with some amazing artwork) that runs parallel to the tram line and open paths running throughout the resort. The trams run frequently and are air conditioned; the boats run less frequently, are open air and slower. We used LAURA'S TAXI SERVICE to get to and from the Kona Airport - they were great and I'd highly recommend them. We rented a car from the rental agencies at the hotel 1 day each week we were there. This enabled us to avoid $250 in self-parking fees and only cost $100 each day (there wasn't a \"volume discount\" until you exceeded 5 days). We also took the resort open air trolley to the King's & Queen's shopping centers - $2 per person per ride.ROOM: Our room was a little dated, but fine. It smelled a little musty when we arrived, but that dissipated when we lowered the AC. It was quite spacious and deep; you enter into a \"dressing room\" before the bedroom proper. There was plenty of drawer space and we really liked the large, programmable safe in the walk-in closet. We could hear the birds waking up @4 am, but not as loudly as those staying on the golf course side. We had a couple of glitches during our stay: our TV started acting up over the weekend, but wouldn't \"misbehave\" for the technicians. They finally saw the problem on the 3rd try (in 1 day) and replaced our TV within the hour. The other glitch was outside the resort's control - a county water main break that resulted in no running water on the resort for @ 4 hours. You may want to lay in some bottled water if you need to take prescription medications, just in case.SWIMMING: There are multiple pools, all in beautiful surroundings, along the back of the resort. Although not heated, we got used to the water temperature very quickly. The adults-only pool at the OT is only open from 10 to 5 and is in full sun much of that time. It should be open longer, consistent with the other pools. We used the long pool with 2 water slides behind the OT most days. Other than the lagoon, there's no sandy beach. Hapuna Beach is a beautiful state-run beach a few miles north of the resort on Route 19 (you'd need a car); the cost is per car and minimal.DINING (This is going to be long.): If you're going to be there for a week or longer, GET THE FOOD DISCOUNT CARD. It's available at any food establishment on the resort, costs $35.99, is effective for 7 days, comes with 2 $10 off coupons, plus 10% off your entire bill at all of the restaurants on the resort. We recouped the cost of the card very quickly.*Luau: don't pay for this until you get your discount card, otherwise, there's a convoluted process to apply the discount (almost $30 for us). Excellent show and very good food. Be sure to bring your camera.*Breakfast Buffet: Sumptuous - a bargain at $30, but still expensive to eat there everyday. Be sure to get the fresh fruit, especially the pineapple and papaya. The coffee here will put hair on your chest, but it's hot and plentiful. If you eat here, you might not need to eat lunch.*Italian: Very close to the OT. Very good food, great pizza and beautiful sunset views. Reasonable prices.*Chinese: On the 2nd level above the Italian restaurant. Good (not great) food, beautiful sunset views, pricey for the value.*Mexican Cantina: A sports bar/restaurant near the adults-only pool. Bland food (and we don't eat super spicy food). We couldn't figure out why it was always crowded at dinner.*Waikoloa Coffee Company: BEST coffee in the resort. Very good breakfast sandwiches, scones, muffins and smoothies. Good prices.*KPC: Excellent steak house style food, very pricey (use your coupon), beautiful sunset views.*Lagoon Grill: mediocre food, average prices, beautiful sunset views.*Ice Cream Shop: Behind the Lagoon Grill; delicious ice cream. Walk it off on your way back to the OT.*The Three Fat Pigs: OFF RESORT in the Kings shopping center; excellent food, decent prices.*Island Gourmet Market: OFF RESORT in the Queens shopping center. Excellent grocery store with full service deli/grill (we brought sandwiches back to our room a couple of times). Full-size products, as well as smaller sizes for hotel guests. They have a shaded patio with tables.. Very good prices.If you stay in the OT, be sure to visit the Palm Terrace. This used to be a breakfast buffet scene for the OT, but they only use it for special events now. Walk past the entry to a beautiful grotto with 2 waterfalls. The large koi will come over to you for bits of bread or anything else you want to give them. We sat there whenever we had breakfast from the Waikoloa Coffee Company. It's beautiful and very serene.If you've got a car, there's an excellent Walmart @ 27 miles south of the resort on Henry Street, right off Route 19 (it might be Route 11 at that point). Everyone kept telling us about it, so we went there one of the days we had a car. It's clean, very well organized, has a great souvenir section and very helpful staff. We printed 91 pictures (4x6) there for $28. They had food, but it wasn't a superstore. We also saw a Costco from the road, but didn't go there.We LOVED our stay on the Big Island at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and couldn't believe how quickly 10 days went by. We would definitely recommend it to our friends. ", " The perfect resort for multiple age friends, family and guests for a destination event. The property is huge with something for everyone. Several different pools, natural ocean lagoon, beautiful landscaping and museum quality artifacts for interest. ", " If you are going to be charged a resort fee, there better be a resort! This is a RESORT! Excellent grounds, lagoon open to the ocean was wonderful with turtles and native fish, walkways throughout the complex, pools with water slides, water features, boat canal and a tram. Very large property where you can easily peg your FitBit and not notice doing it! Couple of small upscale shopping areas and restaurants nearby. ", " Our stay at the Makai area of the hotel was wonderful and we enjoyed all the special perks. The Hilton staff I'd top knock from the valet to the pool side staff.Their knowledgeable activities staff were helpful in planning our site seeing. ", " We did not stay in this hotel but the next time we go we definitely will...we spent 2 full days here and had an AMAZING time...the pools, the water slides, the snorkeling, paddle boats, water bicycles, the great drinks, the dolphins...ALL AWESOME...this is such a great place for all ages...and so safe for the little ones....I can not say enough about this great place and the very helpful and kind staff...all were amazing but Crystal(the manager of the Lagoon Hut) was the BEST...she was extremely sweet and helpful...she definitely goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy and enjoying their visit....can't wait to come back again someday...and I would recommend this place to EVERYONE.... ", " When we arrived on the Big Island after staying in Maui, I booked us at another hotel....I was not happy and quickly moved us the Hilton. The Hilton made our vacation. From booking our zip line to all of our accomodations. It was amazing, we will be back with our family. ", " Our first time to Hawaii, I'll try to provide some perspective for the first time traveler. We stayed here six nights, in oceanfront rooms in the Ocean Tower. I did not know that the Big Island is mostly a lava field on the west side, and that resorts are literally terraformed as oases into essentially a wasteland. On the east side it rains.After disembarking at Kona airport, I thought I was on a version of Mars. You need a rental car. Drive 18 miles north to the human-created Hilton Waikoloa Village oasis, which is 62 acres of first class engineering, adjoining other resorts/condos/shopping center. Our rooms were great, loved the place, especially all the South Pacific art that is everywhere. If you want to be near the big pool/waterfall/lagoon, then the Lagoon Tower may be preferable to Ocean Tower. If you don't enjoy walking, this resort may not be the place for you. But we had a blast.There are sand beaches nearby - I recommend Hapuna Beach State Park - but mostly there is lava rock.Do bring your own mask/snorkel as there are many places in the area to snorkel - like the abandoned harbor at Mahukona - plus the lagoon at the Hilton where you really can swim with big green turtles.Plan your daytrips - up north to Hawi Town, drive the perimeter of the island including Akaka Falls, spend a half day or more at Volcanoes National Park, drive to the observatories atop Mauna Kea, visit a ranch or coffee plantation. We also did a dive out of Kona. Bring a warm jacket - there are varied eco systems on the Island.Food - expensive at the resort. Generally good, except the blue tile roofed place next to the lagoon. I recommend the Tropics Ale House bar & grill, right across the road adjacent to a golf course. Sansei, in the shopping plaza, was good. If you are heading to Mauna Kea I recommend Island Lava Java for sandwiches/breakfast. It is 8 miles east. You can buy wine (bring a corkscrew), beer, and stuff at Island Gourmet Markets in the shopping plaza near the Hilton. The rooms have fridges.There are large company groups and convention goers, by the way, and lots of kids. We would go back here. ", " Where begin? This amazing resort screams fun, relax and pamper yourself all at once. My daughter enjoyed all the pools and water slides. The pools where beautiful flowing over rocks and making waterfalls every where you looked. The room we had was ocean front and stunning views. It was comfy and clean. The had a lagoon to play with water toys and snorkel. It was surrounded by ocean scenery that was landscaped and perfect to just let your mind wander. ", " From a family that is constantly traveling, this resort was one of the most impressive. I can with a large group and the hotel was extremely accommodating. The grounds were absolutely breath taking and the lagoon was awesome! Definitely will not regret staying here. ", " We have stayed here before and have always really enjoyed it!! We were here again for our kids Spring Break. This hotel has everything for the family. Our kids are 8 and 12. They were in heaven. The pools and especially the \"Lagoon\" which is an ocean inlet so you will see tons of fish and even Honu!! The property is beautiful. The artwork is even better. The service is really good which is nice for a property this size. My kids really loved taking the tram and the boat around the property. It was quite the novelty for them. There are many people who complain about the property's size and how long it takes to get around, our family does not mind this at all. We walk everywhere and with how pretty the property is we didn't mind this at all. We will DEF be back!! ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa with my wife and boys over a long weekend. This resort has everything you want and need to keep everyone entertained and happy. They have variety in their three pool areas and their Food and Beverage options and their accommodation with all the towers being connected by a tram or boat or by walking the resort. Once you know your way around the resort it can be quicker to walk with short cuts across the resort. Both the family pools have a lot to offer and are both very different. There is also an adult only pool which is great if you want some quiet time alone. The resort has a Keiki Club that will entertain and take care of you kids if you want some alone time. The activities are endless with a tidal ocean lagoon that has water bikes, paddle boats, stand up paddle, kayaks, snorkeling equipment and other beach toys. The lagoon has multiple different fish and at least ten turtles that are use to people swimming and playing with them. There is a shark enclosure with two black tip sharks. Their dolphin enclosure is well laid out for the dolphins and for people to share their enclosure with them while getting up close with them. The rooms are clean, well maintained and large with various views from around the resort. The staff are the greatest asset this resort has. They definately exude the Aloha hospitality. Everyone we came in contact with was so friendly, attentive and helpfull as if we were the only guests they were taking care of. I would definatley recommend this resort to anyone and if we return to Kona will stay here again. ", " This was our 58th. anniversary and we got a free bottle of wine and a free breakfast. We swam with the dolphins and that was great. https://plus.google.com/photos/113469061768012111877/albums/6141012760317750705 ", " My wife and I recently stayed at the wonderful Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort. We stayed in the Makai Section of the resort which provided additional resort benefits. The hotel rooms were clean, spacious, well appointed, quite, and very comfortable. The ocean views from our balcony was breathtaking. We could see the ocean, pools, and the dolphin lagoon.The resort staff was friendly and always willing to help make our stay great. The restaurants on property were all very good. We especially liked the Kamuela Provision Company. The food, beverages, service, and breathtaking ocean sunset views make it one of the best dinning experiences we have ever had. We came back a total of three times during our trip.Special thank you to Jacque, Chef Hans, Tiffany, and our servers Lora and Ryan. ", " I've been going there 2 - 3 times a year since 2001. This property, employees, food, activities, views, dolphins, pools, spa, tennis courts are by far the best I have visited. I've been to Austria, France, Monte Carlo, and most everyone of our states nothing compares. (Okay the Mediterranean view from my balcony in Monte Carlo was fabulous) I've traveled with my family and solo. Memories were made for all. It is simply like going to see your Ohana. ", " We had a fantastic time, from dinner, to watching dolphins swim in the dolphin ponds. Our room was quiet. The lobby is hawaiian amazing. We will go back for a romantice week. We walked from the room instead of taking the tram. Amazing grounds, even a hammock. ", " A fantastic location, a huge resort with awesome facilities. The Lagoon pool is the best surprise, snorkelling and swimming with the Green Sea Turtles was very memorable. Plenty of food options and the overall service from the staff is exceptional. A family must holiday destination. ", " My husband and I stayed at Hilton Waikoloa for 6 nights during our honeymoon. We really enjoyed this property. Our room in the Palace Tower was perfect. The location was beautiful and quiet, and we enjoyed time on the balcony that offered a fabulous view of the grounds and ocean. The property is so very clean and well kept.The pools were too cold to swim in, however we enjoyed the lagoon. The trams and boats were slow, which we didn't mind so much as we were here to relax and appreciated getting off of our feet after long days. The food is overpriced and mediocre, so I highly advise venturing out to other local eateries.Overall, this hotel is in an absolutely beautiful location. I can see how some travelers end up disappointed if they were planning to stay on property. There is so much to do on the Big Island and many restaurants are located just a 20-30 minute drive away to Kailua-Kona. We enjoyed our drives around the island, surrounded by lava rock and stumbling upon stunning sightseeing and attractions. We plan to vacation on the Big Island again, and we will definitely consider the Hilton Waikoloa as a top contender for hotel accommodations. ", " This resort is filled with sooooo many things to do, when my family and I planned to go to Hawaii we didn't really book any activities because we were not sure what we wanted to do when we got there. Luckily for us we had a lot of stuff to do in our own hotel so we really did not have to go anywhere else. The hotel is equipped with amazing views and activities inside. It's connected to the beach and you can easily take a dive into the ocean water from the hotel itself. There are several pools and lounging areas to choose from including a saltwater lagoon where you can rent kayaks and other water toys for a low rate. If you are a guest at the hotel you get many discounts in the hotel for being a guest. The hotel also gives free tram rides and boat rides which are fun to take advantage of when you are feeling a bit tired or just wanting to relax a little bit. There are dolphins in the hotel as well which you can watch for free from a clear distance, the only time you would have to pay is if you want to swim with them or touch them. Overall the hotel was amazing every room has a balcony, free wifi, and is very clean and fun to stay at. The views were amazing and definitely a great resort to stay at especially if you were a first timer in Hawaii like I was. I would definitely stay at this resort again, I totally fell in love! ", " We spend a week at this resort in beautiful Waikaloa. The grounds are spectacular, right on the beach with a lagoon for the kids to play/snorkel in and 3 lovely pools. The restaurants were good (not amazing) but the views were amazing from the restaurants as well as the rooms. It sits next to Hilton's golf course, and provides plenty of space for long walks along the beach and other activities. The only downfall to this hotel is that one gets tired of riding the tram or boat to the Ocean tower rooms. Otherwise, it was perfectly wonderful. ", " We spent two weeks in April on the Big Island. It was our first trip to Hawaii. The first week we celebrated our Anniversary at the Marriott Waikoloa. Great place. Then we moved over the the Hilton for a week my wife won with her company. WOW. This place is impressive. The minute you walk into the lobby and take the stairs you realize how BIG this resort really is. There is a tram. That's the second clue. If you don't like walking or don't have the patience to wait for tram or water taxi you will NOT like this place. We thought it was great. We rarely used the tram and used the time to walk and see the place and work off all the good food we ate. The rooms were good. We had a partial ocean view. Grounds were gorgeous. They have several pools to choose from and a sandy lagoon that is fed from the ocean. So there are fish and sea turtles. You can rent paddle boards, snorkel gear, kayaks and things like that. We also rented the covered double chairs. It wa nice and relaxing. We were there on a retreat so all the food was provided. There are a lot of options. We liked everything we ate. The luau there is AWESOME. My only complaint the live music at the bar shuts down around 11pm. Island rules I believe about noise. There are several shops on site. Friendly, helpful staff. We really enjoyed it and would bring our kids here the next time we come. They also have dolphin quest on site. It was cool seeing them. Great trip and great stay. ", " We have stayed at Waikoloa several times and are headed back again. It's a great relaxing geaway. Dolphins, lagoon, water falls, slides, many pools, Disney type train that goes from hotel to hotel. If you don't like that, step into a Venetian Water Taxi for a cruise around the property. Art everywhere you turn. It's a short trip into Hilo, but there are mant eating locations on the property. Shopping and other restaurants close. Golf on the property, minature golf, and views beyond belief. ", " We were impressed. Huge property with many activities. Also great space to relax by ocean, swim with dolphins, kayaking, multiple pools. Most rooms have great views. All the bldgs have impressive art. 2000 rooms, 900 staff. ", " First time at this lovely hotel. Check in was a breeze. They even escorted us to our room and gave us the scoop on the hotel and activities. Pools were great, Luau was fun and servers were the best!! We enjoyed all the restaurants. A little pricey but most resorts are.. Loved our room in the lagoon tower. Had a problem with our air conditioner and it was repaired immediately. We went to Lava Lava Beach Club for dinner twice. That's a fun thing to do. Watch the sun go down, listen to live music and have a great dinner. We had no problem with wi-fi or the towels or the room or customer service. Everyone who worked there tried their best to make our stay enjoyable. Don't listen to the negative reviews. Enjoy your vacation and this beautiful resort!! ", " This resort is expansive...really big! That means there is a lot to do onsite, but there might be a bit of walking involved. Yes, there are trams and canal boats running, but I'm usually too impatient to wait--and I really don't mind the exercise. My husband's Fitbit said it was a mile from our room in the Palace Tower to the coffee shop in the Lagoon Tower (the scenic route along the ocean). It was such a beautiful walk, I didn't notice! It's great to have the Dolphins onsite--I love to watch them up close, but not enough to spend $200 for half an hour to \"interact\" with them. The pools are great and not too crowded in the mornings or late afternoons. The lagoon onsite is also great. My son took his snorkel gear down into the bay between the Palace and Ocean Towers and spent two hours exploring. We had gone to two other snorkel beaches in Kona and he said this bay had more interesting coral and fish than those places. We bought snorkel gear at target ($35 each) and that seems like a great way to go for us--not knowing how many hundreds of people had their mouth on my snorkel makes me feel better--and the quality is fine. Our room is a bit dated, but we are rarely here, so I'm fine with that. It is pretty large and there are four of us in here with two beds. I hear the Lagoon Tower has the upgraded rooms, but was an additional $50/night, so I'm perfectly happy here. Good little Mexican cantina onsite with outdoor dining and good prices. Poolside options are sparse and only after 11am. My husband hits the buffet breakfast to \"work\" and pays $30 every morning while the kids and I bought store items (cereal, milk, fruit, etc) and eat breakfast on the lanai. It's a bit of a hassle to go offsite--walking a ways, getting your car brought up--so we try to go out once per day and do everything (snorkel, shop, surf, etc) at once. I could say lots more about this place--I think it is a fantastic resort and island for our family of two adults, a 13 and 16 year olds. Don't let the immensity keep you from coming here--just bring comfortable walking shoes!! ", " I am a longstanding Hilton Diamond member and have stayed at this property many times since it opened, including the last few years since I moved from the SF Bay Area to Hawaii. I know Hiltons and this is my favorite because it is an architectural gem, with a large asian art collection on display, in arguably the most beautiful spot on earth and the staff treats us like royalty. We are staying at the property now and I triggered a spine condition that precludes walking; the staff who know us well have gone way out of there way to help. Kona/Kohala has superb weather and scenery. The facilities are well above the norm for top resorts, including pools and a collection of friendly, talkative tropical birds. They hire good local musicians in the lounge, whom we know as we are in the music industry. So you don't think I am writing a review to help my friends, I will say it is slightly pricey, but in fact, it represents very good value by Hawaii cost standards. And, yes, the rooms could use a refresher; but I love the large size and much prefer that they invest in the outside facilities, rather than the rooms which I use only to sleep in (excepting the current stay). We always request the Palace Tower Diamond floor because we like the elegance of the lobby and proximity. The Chinese restaurant next door has very good authentic food and is reasonably priced with helpful staff. ", " My Husband and I stayed a few days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village before going over to Kings Land with his family. We absolutely loved this hotel! It is by far the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at! The hotel grounds were nothing short of fantastic. Every direction I turned was picturesque. The tram was soo convenient, and I also loved the boat rides through the hotel. The pools and private beach area, was very impressive. There is no way you can not find a spot to catch some rays. Best advice I can give, is it to order the lava flow! Yes the drinks are pricey but they are worth it and so delicious! ", " Beautiful doesn't begin to describe this resort even though the rooms could use a refresher. The service throughout the resort was excellent. Even with a tram and boat shuttle the ways are long and I couldn't imagine my father with Parkinson here, however as a family with teenage boys it was a fabulous place to stay and we look forward to our next trip. ", " Just finished a 5 day stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. Before I booked my reservation I of course read the reviews on TripAdvisor--which generally has mixed reviews. I stayed at the end of March 2015 with family and friends for the LavaMan Triathlon and unequivocally recommend the Hilton Waikoloa. We all stayed in the Makai rooms, which are a little pricier than rooms in other buildings, but which were all recently upgraded. The rooms were comfortable, clean, modern, and had amazing views of the grounds and of the ocean. No complaints at all about the rooms (there were three rooms among us all.) I've read complaints about the other buildings and have no opinion on those as I never saw them. I also read complaints about the size of the resort--after my stay I just don't understand those complaints. The place is spread out, but why is that a bad thing? You simply have to walk or catch the tram or catch the boat. But it is really not a long walk and it's pleasant in any event given all the art work lining the outdoor hallways. The pool, many hot tubs, and lagoon are all clean and well-maintained. And the bars spread throughout the grounds offer excellent drinks. The only negative I can report about my stay was the quality of the food. Typical hotel food--nothing great. But there are better restaurants at the nearby shopping center (a short shuttle ride away) and at the Marriott which is also a short shuttle ride away or a short walk away. If you plan to travel to the Big Island and want to stay on the west coast, definitely look into staying at the Hilton Waikoloa (especially if you have kids as the place is very kid friendly). If you're going to race the LavaMan the Hilton will probably be the host hotel which is a short bike ride away from the transition area and race start. ", " This was a lovely place to be for a week! Staff was very accommodating, especially James & Brandon. Snorkeling in lagoon with the sea turtles & hand feeding them orchids was a highlight. Our room in the lagoon Makai tower was nicely appointed, clean & comfortable. The dolphin experience was great! There is no beach but the view is really pretty. Some interesting creatures in the tide pools. If you do not have children, it may not be ideal if you are looking for peace & quiet. Susie (the night manager) was so gracious in helping us with adjusting our reservation after a stressful delay in our flights & arrival. It was overall a wonderful vacation here! ", " An absolute must stay on the big island. Such a scenic resort. Wonderful views of the sunset. Lots of pools. Enjoyed riding the tram and boat. I would recommend having a rental to visit Kona for an occasional dinner. Eating at the resort can get pricey, that being said, we enjoyed the Chinese restaurant located on the resort. Professional service all around. Will visit here again. ", " I'm currently staying at this beautiful resort and am overwhelmed by the kind and helpful staff. Shirley, a longtime Hilton operator, gave me so many helpful tips over the phone, prior to our departure, that I made it my business to seek her out and meet her. She is wonderful! The MOD (manager on duty) Jesse was very, very helpful, kind and considerate when I hit a couple of glitches. He did whatever he needed to accommodate us and it was GREATLY appreciated. The lagoon is such a fun area and we truly enjoyed the blue cabana chair rental for around $50. (two chairs) Was well worth it! Also...the breakfast plan is the way to go. Yummy food, great service, beautiful scenery! There are so many things to do and see on the site...that I'm not sure we'll be able to accomplish it all. I highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa!! ", " I think this is a nearly perfect Hawaiian resort for families. The tram and boat shuttles were a hit with our teenage boys, as were the pools with slides and the lagoon with all of its available toys. The Lagoon / Makai tower was lovely and its location within the resort was perfect. Even our boys' mountain-view room had a bit of an ocean view (although my husband and I fully enjoyed our dolphin/lagoon/ocean view, which was admittedly better). Our ocean view room w/ king bed had a walk-in shower, and the boy's mountain-view room w/ 2 queens had a tub. I wouldn't call these 'cons', but things to be aware of: the 10% food discount card is totally worth it if you plan on eating at the onsite restaurants more than twice, and it applies to the ice cream shop by the pool as well. It's a pain to stay on top of it and make sure your kids are using it before they buy $8 ice cream cones, but we definitely saved the cost of the card ($40) and more (you get 2 $10 coupons with the card too, and you can use them at pretty much any of the onsite restaurants - we used them the first morning at the breakfast buffet). The restaurants are expensive, but so was everywhere we went on the big island, so the 10% discount with 2 adults and 3 teenage boys added up to more than the cost of the card very quickly. Remember to add the $25 per room per day resort charge into your price calculations. It's not negotiable, so why they don't just include it in the price, I don't know. (Probably to appear cheaper on sites like this!) As of our March 2015 trip, the cabana the spa uses for outdoor massages had blown out to sea, so that's unavailable until they build a new one. I personally loved the ocean-fed lagoon. Saw all sorts of fish and sea turtles in there. A bit chilly at times, but sit out in the sun, get hot, then go for a cool dip. It was fine. There's a shuttle that costs a few dollars per person that will take you to the King and Queens Marketplaces, and those are a fun diversion. You can rent a car onsite, which is what we did, from National - I liked doing it this way, because it was easy to pick up and return through valet, and during our 7-day stay, we rented a car for 4 days in the middle, for all our off-site activities, and trips to Kailua-Kona and the Volcano park (a VERY long drive, but a fun day-trip around the island - start early!). Beautiful resort (fantastic artwork, sculptures and antiques everywhere), well maintained with friendly staff. Pricey, so just know that the hotel, and just being in Hawaii, is going to blow your budget! If you go in to your trip accepting that, you'll be a lot happier than if you're trying to penny-pinch. ", " We stayed our last night at the Waikoloa Hilton. We had a blast. Are son loved the pool and slide. So did my husband. We received an upgrade on our room which made it even more special. The front desk was very helpful and had wonderful customer service. It was quite crowded due to spring break but still the hotel gave excellent service. Just a heads up it can be expensive for meals. We are a family of 3 and it averaged about $100 for lunch and then about $100 for dinner. We will defiantly be back. ", " I stayed in a partial ocean view room in the Ocean Tower. My room was clean, quiet and comfortable. I loved my \"partial\" ocean view as it was more than \"partial\". The staff was friendly at all times. There were plenty of restaurant options available throughout the property. While I agree that the prices were high (from other reviewers), I looked at it as convenience. The property is huge and I'm sure I didn't see all of it. I enjoyed the walk from the front lobby to the Ocean Tower and there were a lot of displays to look at.My only regret was not staying another night so that I could see everything that this property has to offer.I would definitely stay here again and I'd stay multiple nights. ", " Facility exceeded expectations. Would recommend to anyone esp. great for families. Lagoon was wonderful. I will go back and will look for other Hilton resorts. Staff was friendly and never without a warm greeting and a smile, ", " Wonderful grounds, and service- fun atmosphere with great whale watching from beach and perfect sunsets. We are HGVC members and know that a Hilton property will be comfortable and clean. As a couple celebrating our anniversary- we won't go back during spring break to many kids :( ", " The Hilton experience was amazing. Employees all were so pleasant, food was delicious at all the restaurants. Loved the charming boat transportation, convenient trains and fun water slides. Great shopping close by and such great excursions with very informative guides. ", " We stayed for a week at Hilton Waikoloa Village and learned valuable tips from reading reviews. For people who complain about the prices, they are on par with other high and higher end resorts. Valet Parking is the way to go, for $5 more than the required self-park you save yourself the hassle and LONG walk to get to your car. The transportation system is fun with the kids, they loved the boats and the train. The REAL winner is the lagoon!...Such nice swimming and paddle boarding with our kids, probably the nicest hotel \"pool\" I've ever swam in.Our room in Lagoon Tower, while I paid for the Mountain View, I had that AND a great water view, and the housekeeping staff, particularly Emily and Cindy were so so so good to us I think they need a raise!!Tip well, as you should anyway, and people are always great to you: I tip early and often, and thank those for great service: and guess what...they keep on giving it! We would certainly return to this Hotel. I am Hilton Gold Member and didn't get a room upgrade but they took money off my bill every day which basically covered the valet parking, so that was decent. Shopping at the hotel is great, well varied, not super-expensive. The food is , well, hotel food. We stay at Hilton's often and it's pretty much what you'd expect. KPC has a great view, and the food was good but the service was just marginal, but if you are in a bad mood at a beautiful hotel in the most beautiful place on earth then you probably shouldn't travel! ", " This resort is fantastic. We stayed there in early June, in the Lagoon tower (the Makai rooms). The room was great. Big, clean, and new looking, with a great view of the ocean.The best deal for food at the resort is the breakfast buffet -- it is only $21 if you go early (6:30 - 7:00 am), and it huge. The Luau is also great -- lot's of food and a very nice show.The pools are nice -- finding a chair in the shade around noon can be a challenge, but otherwise, there's plenty of room for everyone. The star of the resort is the lagoon -- it is a large lagoon in the middle of the resort. Since it is open to the ocean, there are lots of fish and sea turtles. We say turtles every day -- 4-5 would be in the lagoon at one time (sometime many more). You can snorkel there and see lots of colorful fish. While there are no reefs in the lagoon, there is plenty of things to see (I even say some moray eels). If you want to go to a proper beach, a 15 minute walk up the coast from the hotel is a big public beach (the walk is through a coral / lava rock lined coast, but there is a clear trail). At that beach you can rent kayaks, paddle boards, book a ride on a catamaran or glass bottom boat (we did the latter, and it was very nice -- you'll pass over lots of reefs). There is a shuttle ($2) to the nearby shopping centers, which will also stop at the beach. You could fill all your time there just at the resort, but you can also rent a car (beware, the line for the rental car onsite, even with a reservation, can take an hour). There's lots to see on the island, especially the top of Mauna Kea and the Volcano National Park. ", " Stayed in the Lagoon Towers the week of March 1. Fantastic stay for the whole family. We were able to watch the whales just off shore from the room (upgraded room for being HHonors Gold), which was one of our highlights of the trip. Of course, this is only a winter activity, but worth timing your trip to Hawaii. Property was great, and although huge, did not feel crowded. Room was spacious and clean, and we were able to take advantage of a few of the hotels amenities such as the Spa (some of it cost free - again gold), nice pools, etc. Overall, one of the nicest Hilton properties I stayed at, and a memorable vacation. Hotel has drawbacks, including over-priced restaurants and bars. We went to the Market nearby on a few occasions for food and drink as a solution. Also had birds wake us up a few mornings, but we were early risers so not as much a bother for us. So no hotel is perfect, but it sure felt pretty close when we were able to just watch the whales go by. ", " This hotel has to be seen to believed from the size, to it's location surrounded by the ocean, incredible grounds & amenities. A train or a boat tranports you through numerous garden oasis by dolphn ponds, a private inlet beach where you can snorkel, paddle board, etc. then there too many pools to count with water features sure to delight children of all ages and even an adult pool. Numerous restaurants in a range of cuisines provide delicious foods in the most scenic & romantic settiings. You never have to leave the resort. Rooms are spacious, clean, could use a bit of updating. ", " This is a fantastic resort with so much to do for kids and adults alike. The resort is spread out over a large area so you never feel crowded. You have water slides, ocean water lagoon (snorkeling, paddle boats, etc.) and dolphins. The Dolphin Quest adventure was a favorite with my kids (remember to book early as spots fill up months in advance). I would recommend staying in the Lagoon Tower which is newer and closer to the activities. There is plenty to eat off site at the nearby King and Queen Shops. Service is outstanding. Definitely the resort to visit if you are going to Kona. ", " I travelled with my husband and 13 year old daughter. We spent 10 nights at the Hilton. We did the express check-in the day before we left so when we arrived we just had to pick up our keys at the front desk. Everything went smoothly upon our arrival - we got on the train and took our luggage to the Ocean Towers. We were on the 6th floor with an ocean view. The room was a lot larger than I was expecting which was a nice surprise. It had two double beds, a fridge and a balcony overlooking the ocean. The property itself was absolutely beautiful. Beautiful art lining the hallway. Beautiful pools, the lagoon beach was nice for snorkelling. You could see fish, turtles and eels. The area for the dolphins was also a nice added feature - you could watch them feeding the dolphins everyday. The property was so vast that it never felt crowded given the number of people that were there during our stay.If you don't like walking this is not the property for you - in our ten days there we did so much walking because we always walked from Ocean Towers to the Parking lot - that would be about a 25 minute walk. We enjoy walking so that was never a problem for us. The only cons about the property would be:- The pools were way too cold,- Resort fee of $25 - Parking fee of $25- Food expensive - drink at the pool $12 US.Given we we were there for 10 nights that was an additional $500 - I thought that was excessive.The only thing we used in the Resort Fee was the WiFi and my daughter and I took the Lei Making class - which they used real white orchids which we both enjoyed.Overall I would recommend the Waikoloa area to anyone visiting Hawaii because it gets the most sun. We went into Kona many days and drove into the cloudy weather and couldn't wait to get back to our resort for some sunshine. ", " It was great had a tram or a boat ride take you to your hotel room. The inside of the room was beautiful. I couldn't expect anything as nice as this hotel is. I had an outside balcony overlooking the Dolphin Pond. The restaurants are very close to my room. I had a free breakfast buffet. I never been in a classier hotel as this is. ", " What else can you say, this resort is a paradise. With over 50 acres of lush grounds, there are numerous places to get lost on the resort without ever leaving. Plenty of places for privacy, great transportation options (tram & canal boats), beautiful pools and waterfalls, what more could a person want. Great option with or without kids as we have done both. Lots of restaurant options on site, but be prepared to pay. The best being the Kamalua Provisions Company (excuse the spelling). Book an early dinner here and sit outside to watch the sun set into the ocean right before your eyes. Yes, this is as romantic as it gets. Other small eating options in the small strip mall about a mile away. They have a shuttle which goes back and forth for that and shopping there. You won't get bored during a week. Oh yeah, and don't forget to swim with the dolphins and enjoy the lagoon! I could go on for hours and haven't even talked about the tremendous views from the rooms, the golf courses, or whale watching. ", " This hotel was beautiful! The lagoon was awesome there were some cool and colorful animals in there. The hotel rooms were very large and the balcony view of the sunrise was amazing. The the pools were awesome they had water slides, hot tubs, and water falls. I loved how the lobby was outdoors. Everybody was so nice there. It was one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. It was very peaceful and relaxing. I enjoyed my experience very much! ", " My husband and I came here for our vacation this year and the grounds are absolutely beautiful! The staff were very nice and accommodating and willing to help with any needs. Its a great place for both families and couples to stay on the Big Island. It has a beach lagoon which is kid friendly and like being on the beach but without the waves and a separate pool for adults. ", " oth the hotel and the room were very clean and the service excellent. The room was very large and had a great view of the gulf course. Only thing, the room did not have enough lights. It needs a light by the sofa for reading. The bed was comfortable. Great food in the restaurants. Really enjoyed the lagoon and walking around the gardens and museum walk. ", " Beautiful resort with stunning views and unlimited water activities. Swimming with the dolphins is a highlight. Yes, it is a large resort where it may take a while to get from one end to the next but we enjoyed every moment and loved the views the water transportation provided. ", " Excellent family vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I want to recognize Jesse Gomez, Front Office Manager. He went above and beyond to help support our request to be close to our friends. We could not have been happier with the room, the resort, the activities, etc. Looking forward to returning and enjoying in the future! Thank you Jesse! ", " Very peaceful and nice facilities. Love the tramp and boat ride around the hotel. Many great activities and great bars and restaurants. Very pricey, but worth to stay if you would like to relax and enjoy the sun and pool. Not a lot of the beach area, but good for a sunbathing spot with a lot of privacy and quiet on the weekdays. It could get busy on the weekend as many family had arrived. ", " The Dolphins were a great attraction. The room was clean and quiet. The tram that takes you around the gardens and to your hotel room takes a bit of time so plan for that. Or you can walk from tower to tower. ", " Beautiful location and massive grounds. Disneyesque features such as monorail and boat that tour the facility and get you from one end to the other. Magnificent vistas and many opportunities to watch the sun setting and rising, sea wildlife frolic and to relax inbetween business obligations. Great for couples and families too. ", " I am an Animals Lover, and I enjoy the fact to see little kitties, cats, and Birds in your Facility. Specially, the cats, they are adorable and love to see walking free in the facility. I understand your facility have a program for these cats, which I am 100% in support to the program, in case you may need donations to continue support the program with these cats please keep my e-mail address and contact me immediately. Thank you again for the opportunity to share my experiences and I am looking forward to come back to your hotel in the near future. ", " I read all the reviews before leaving on this trip and was pleasantly surprised by the grandeur of this complex, the amazing art and sculptures on display throughout, cleanliness of property etc etc. Though pricey, anyone would understand their need to recoup costs once you see where this property is and how difficult it would've been to bring the land to the point of even being usable let alone create an almost Disneylike masterpiece. I was glad for the trams and on site boats for transportation to and from other points on site, even though we like to walk. A beautiful beach is nearby accessed by a short walk along the shore or by free shuttle. If we'd asked sooner, we would have know about the access to groceries, liquor and other restaurants nearby, also accessable by shuttle. I would go back if I could. ", " This is a huge hotel as everyone will tell you, but worth the stay! The grounds of this resort were beautiful. The ponds, waterfalls, dolphins, sharks, everything were so wonderful! There is a tram that runs to every building, but the walk is so beautiful we never took the tram. We are Silver hilton honors and were upgraded to the condo section of the resort. It was magnificent and right by the Ocean Tower! The view were both of the ocean and the golf course in the back. It was a huge condo and so nicely appointed. Housekeeping was fantastic. We also ate at KPC which is literally on the ocean. In fact, we ate all our meals at the resort somewhere. So much to over. The only down thing is we really wanted to see the National Volcano Park at is was over a 6 hour round trip, further then we wanted to go since the resort was so beautiful. It really isn't near too many landmarks you may want to see, but so worth the stay! ", " overall I was happy with the service, however I was disappointed with the service of the breakfast place. The second day we eat there we went to the omelet bar which the guy there by passed my two daughters who were standing in line to get some eggs. I not sure if he was just focus on making omelets. but one of my daughters left because he by passed them and only helped the adults ", " The stay was awesome there was so much to do at the resort snorkeling in the lagoon, the chance to interact with dolphins, or just siting and watching the ocean and the whales breach. You really did not need to leave the resort. I would highly recommend staying if you get the chance. ", " My mum and I stayed here for a relaxing interlude on our island hopping trip and it was great. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was lovely (we did have a little issue with the air conditioning and house keeping but they were quickly resolved). The grounds are amazing, the lagoon has turtles swimming in it. However be prepared to pay, you have to pay for all activities, which are limited and expensive. The food and drinks are priced higher than most parts of the islands too but all the food we ate was really lovely. There is not a huge selection of vegetarian foods with most restaurants only having one option except of Imari the Japanese restaurant which was incredible (they had quite a few tofu options). We stayed 4 nights and I think had we stayed longer I would have become ores with the food options being a vegetarian myself, but much of Hawaii is like that unfortunately - there are only so many vegie burgers a person can eat.We stayed in the Ocean Tower which was great, they have done up the other towers which looked really lovely but I think the Ocean Towers is fabulous, especially for the price.We went to the spa for one of the days which was really nice, however I have never been to a 'day spa' before so i cannot compare, but camping to the style of spas we have in Australia it was very good.Highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing break, plenty of pools, dining options, and art to look at as well as the lagoon and walking you'd never have to leave (but there are shuttles if you want to).But it forces you to slow down and take some time, it never felt crowded or busy and there were lots of families but we never felt bothered by the children. ", " We enjoyed the village. We were on the outside ground floor near the pools and ocean area. We had morning coffee watching the local cats play. We walked instead of taking tram or boats. Nice church service! We liked the pools, path to A Bay and artwork. Very nice place and someone was always cleaning. Great place for sunsets! We would go back with our kids again.Do not go snorkeling at A Bay. To much boat traffic makes it cloudy. Better snorkeling by driving South 25 min at local park. ", " Great hotel in a great area on the big island. The hotel is massive. So big that it has its own monorail. The only bad thing I can say is that there is no good ocean beach on the property. There is however a great lagoon filled with sea turtles and plenty of marine life to check out while paddle boarding. I loved this hotel. It is beautiful and convienant. ", " This was one leg of are honeymoon and the most enjoyable and interesting (the artefacts and antiquities displayed on the connecting walkways ) Its a long way from uk but well worth the trip.  The Dolphins, land scape gardens,friendly staff and all the amenitieswere excellent. The room we had overlooked the sea and the pool so we could sit out and watch the torches being light every night (you had to be there) and sun the sunsets were incredable the dolphin pool was a massive hit and they seemed so happy and well looked after in all a wonderful experience this hotel has a lot too offer. ", " This place is awesome. Very large rooms and very very clean. You can not walk around without seeing someone cleaning something almost everywhere. The food prices are on the high side, but it is a small price to pay for the convenience. This part of the coast of Hawaii island is beyond description. Lava coast, sunshine. The resort lagoon is perfect for snorkeling and swimming because it is protected from the open ocean, resulting in very calm waters. Even though it is protected, all of the natural wildlife live in the lagoon. Eels, fish, turtles, everything that you would see on an open ocean reef. If you do pay for extra attractions, like snuba or equipment rental, the staff is very informative and helpful. They are also generous with watching your time. If you are military or kamaina, make sure to tell the staff when you are making reservations, significant discounts. ", " We stay here 1-3 times a year and every time is a winner. This Feb we stayed in the Lagoon tower above the dolphin exhibit and my toddler went crazy! Every morning she would get up and see the dolphins jumping all around. The only problem is she wanted to touch the dolphins like she saw other encounters going on. We finally did and it was totally worth it. We signed the 2yr old up for hula lessons, ukulele lessons and encounter with the dolphins. She loved every minute.. The place is wonderful,the pools are great. The monorail and boats that go around the property are fun for the toddler to ride. We would highly recommend this property. The staff are just wonderful. The luau was fun but my toddler insisted to dance on the stage with them during the show. Not so fun taming a screaming toddler during the show. We love coming here because there is so much to do right here at the hotel. The food was expensive but that's to be expected. Nothing but fun for the family is at this place. JUST DO IT! ", " We returned from the resort two weeks ago. This was our 4th trip to this resort. We are Hilton honor members which is why we have not checked out any other properties in Waikoloa or the rest of Big Island. Let me start by sharing that the resort is a stand alone property about 20 min drive north of the airport. There is no shuttle service to this resort or any other. So a taxi ride or a rental car. Valet at the hotel is $30.00 a day, or $25.00 to self park. My advice. Don't rent a car unless you have an island itinerary. Reason. The resort is so spectacular if you are like us you will plop yourself down and it's so wonderfully relaxing you probably won't want to move. Should you desire a day trip, you can rent a car right at the property. The property sits on a bay and is built around it. There are 3 separate towers of rooms. Because of our Hilton status (my husband travels a lot for work), we are upgraded and have only stayed in the Lagoon Tower facing the ocean or over the dolphin area. I know Lagoon is the tower that has been most recently upgraded so the rooms are amazing. The rooms are spacious, modern clean and quiet. Mini fridge, no microwave, in room coffee maker. Coffee...just ok. I cannot speak for the other towers, except we had friends stay in an Ocean Tower room that faced the ocean over the golf spot, and it was more dated but still roomy. I prefer the Lagoon Tower rooms. I guess it depends how much time you plan to be in your room. The resort itself is beautiful. Several large pools, some pools have water slides, and a ocean fed lagoon with beach chairs and sand. The only sandy beach on the property. The awesome thing here is you can swim along side tropical fish and a parade of sea turtles that call the lagoon home. No touching just walk along side them, swim or snorkel next to them and give them space. The ocean beach is coral and lava rock. If you want a beach on the ocean you have to traverse off the property toward the Marriott resort where you will find a nice sandy beach. About a 10-15 minute walk along coral and lava but its a beautiful walk. Or get that rental car and drive up the highway to some of the worlds most beautiful beaches. The amazing thing at this property is that even when a huge convention shows up , and it has each time we've gone, you would never know 1300 people just arrived and there is still enough space to lay around a pool. A contrast to the Hawaiian Village on Waikiki and many other resorts, where you battle finding a beach chair. At the lagoon here, the chairs are first come and shade is minimum. Hint, there is a covered cabana right beside the towel exchange booth at the lagoon that is free and a first come. Other cabanas need to be rented from Ocean sports where you also need to pay to use paddle board, peddle boats, snorkeling gear etc. With the exception of Waikiki strip, don't expect a grand nightlife at this resort or anywhere near it. Life is laid back in Hawaii and it gets pretty quiet after sunset. On Big Island if you want any sort of nightlife or after hours fun, you need to head to Kona and that is a 45 min drive south. Otherwise be prepared to stroll the grounds, its beautiful. Look at the stars, there are so many stars. admire the art gallery along the stroll around the property. Ride the canal boats around the property, twice if you want to. or if you are lucky enough, to have an ocean front room. Just sit back on your lanai and listen to the ocean. The biggest draw back is the expensive food that traps you. Like previous writers, even coffee and a muffin for two can cost you $20.00 or more. There are several food choices on the resort but all are expensive. And feeding a family here will cost you some big dollars. However, the hotel provides a free shuttle to the two little malls a short way from the hotel or you can take a nice walk. There you can find your way to less expensive eating, particularly at the Queens Court. There also is a grocery store and we offset our breakfast with cereal yogurt and fruit etc. Lunch was nearly always left overs from our dinners or the poolside caf\u00e9 at the Kona pool . Dinners, yes that's a tough one. If you are traveling as a couple and want the ultimate in romance try KPC on the property. The food was great also but the ambience cannot be beat. For a $50.00 upcharge, which provides with ocean side seating, a cocktail for two and an appetizer, you can have a table adjacent to the edge by the ocean and watch a sunset and if you there during Humpback whale migration, you can also watch a whale show at dinner. The pools are not heated, perhaps its a Hawaii thing, the pools at other hotels on the islands are also not heated The unique experience here are the dolphins but I agree when you look at the enclosure and then turn your head and see the big open ocean it does make you sad for the dolphins. They seem well loved however and well taken care of albeit their small space, and frolic happily in their home. My first trip I was thrilled to watch the dolphins and in one instance watch the tender care the attendents were giving to special needs children who were being treated to an up close and personal encounter. This trip however , I was watching them and just really wished they could be let free.This is a breathtakingly beautiful resort. It's large so if you have difficulty walking they have tried to help by offering a tram and the canal boats to help you get to different places. It's stand alone and its quiet. Dead quiet by 9 pm! If you need nightlife , shopping, a party scene, you won't find it here. For that you need to have the Waikiki strip in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. If you are ok with going to sleep by 10-11 and up at 6-7 this is a great place for you. The staff are delightful and helpful. There were other guests talking about getting your car at valet...we've only had really funloving and hard working attendants at the drop off and pick up, We may have to wait a bit for them to bring the car, but we are on Hawaii time so we don't let it get to us. ", " One of a kind hotel, with very expansive swimming lagoons, walking trails, restaurants, cultural artifacts, etc. Stayed here 5 nights and really enjoyed the different attractions. The resort is also centrally located with easy access to golf courses, shopping centers, beaches, etc. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with both western and Asian style food offerings. ", " We were very pleased with the prompt and careful service we received. We have visited many times before because of your reasonable Kama'aina discounted rates. We would appreciate if they did not increase. ", " We always stay at the Hilton Waikoloa due to the great service and amazing facilities. The staff members are very helpful and there is an array of activities offered at this venue. Hilton definitely lives up to their standards especially at this resort. ", " One of the nicest resorts I have stayed at in Hawaii. They have just about everything you could want. Golf, Shopping, Driving, Fishing and Location. I spend about 6-8 weeks a year in Hawaii working and this is the only place I will stay on the Big Island. ", " I loved our stay at the hotel. The hotel is so well designed and has so many activities to offer. The food on the hotel grounds was a bit pricey but was delicious and worth every penny (our favorite was KPC that had spectacular views and delicious food). The grounds are meticulously maintained and the staff are super friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable and had a nice ocean view. We did alot of walking (the grounds are huge) but they do have many options so that you don't have to walk. The bath soaps were not the best but we brought some from home. There are local shops that are within walking distance (0.5 mile or so) but you can take a trolley. The grocery store has most anything you need (water, snacks, liquor, souvenirs, lotions, etc.) and is not too expensive. There is a rocky trail that leads to the beach from the hotel or you can visit the Marriot hotel which is on the way to the Queens market and go straight to the beach. Luau was ok, nice show but food was ehhh. Overall loved the stay and can't wait to go back again. ", " We just got back from 6 days with my wife, 2 year old, and my parents. This was the best family vacation we have ever had. We booked through Hilton and had the chance to upgrade to the Duke Kohanamoku Presidential Suite in the Ocean Tower (with the upgrade fee, we only paid $619/night for 3100/sf). This is room 7099. Pools are great and they are not warm, but far from freezing as many people state. It is so hot that the pool feels very refreshing. Restaurants are sub-par (pizza place was ok and Waikoloa Coffee Co is good, Imari is the worst) so get off property and go to Lava Lava Beach Club or up the coast to Merriman's or the Canoe Club. I also recommend to not go to this place during holidays or school vacations. We checked out the Saturday before Presidents Day and the hotels was a zoo. The first part of the week was almost empty and it was perfect. Finally, do not come here on your honeymoon. This place is not romantic and completely set up for kids. The price may look right but fork up the extra cash and go somewhere else, like the Mauna Lani or Mauna Kea. ", " This was the best vacation ever! My family loved everything about it. The Hilton Waikoloa is spacious and breathtakingly beautiful. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower overlooking the dolphin lagoon. We had the most incredible view of the dolphins and the ocean. You pay a little more but you get a bracelet allowing you free internet connection and unlimited privileges to the Spa and Fitness Center. The Lagoon Tower is located directly across from the Spa and shops and close to the largest pools in the resort. We also paid for Valet Parking (so worth it as the parking lot is quite a walk). Our 3-year old loved riding on the tram and the boat. There are beautiful walking trails throughout the resort meandering along the scenic waterways and waterfalls and tropical flora and fauna. We loved all the water activities at the Lagoon-especially seeing so many Green Sea Turtles! Most impressive is the collection of art from around the world that lines the walkways. The weather was perfect, the pools were amazing, the service was exceptional, and everything about the hotel was exquisite. It was perfect in every way! ", " A short summary of the Hilton Waikoloa Village review: a fantastic hotel, as long as you stay in the right tower.The reviews for this Hilton on the internet are quite mixed. They gave me doubts about staying there, but from my experience it is definitely the place to stay if visiting the Big Island. The Hilton Waikoloa has everything you could want when coming back to rest from a long day of snorkeling or hiking:-It is nicely located-The complex is big with lots of rooms-The hotel has all the amenities-There are great activities on siteLocated on the dry and sunny part of the islandThe Hilton Waikoloa is located on the western coast of the Big Island. The climate there is dry and hot; so, unless you are unlucky, you won\u2019t have to deal with rain at the Hilton Waikoloa. It\u2019s not too far from the Kona airport (about a 25 minute taxi ride), and also close enough to the excursions you may want to do around the island (you may still need to rent a car though because the island is quite big). There are also two shopping complexes very close to the hotel (there\u2019s actually a tram that regularly shuttles you back and forth).A huge resortDuring our taxi ride to the hotel, the driver referred to the Hilton as \u2018Disney\u2019 and we quickly saw why when we arrived: the resort is huge. So many different room towers, pools, restaurants, a beautiful spa, and even a man-made lagoon that opens into the ocean. It is significantly bigger than the neighboring Marriott Hotel at Waikoloa. First, let\u2019s start with the most important decision you will make there: which tower to stay in. The hotel recently renovated the Lagoon Tower, which costs more, but is an absolute must. The rooms in that tower are great, and you even get VIP bracelets for preferred seating at the pool. The rooms are also equipped with Sony Playstations, so you rent movies (for free) near the spa facilities. In case you are thinking of saving some money, just remember that most of the negative reviews about this hotel are from guests who did not stay in this tower.Here's a YouTube video I took snorkeling in the hotel lagoon:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXtr9HKMR48Here's another video of the sunset from behind the hotel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2FaqbeROfAThis review is already long and there's so much more to say. I will post more soon. In short: this is the hotel to stay at in Kona! ", " My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 30/01/15 - 06/02/15. We had an amazing time and I will try to explain in detail why that was !! Firstly check in was smooth with a friendly, efficient welcome and we were told we had Room 6329 in Lagoon Tower which had a great view of the sea and to the side the dolphins pool. It was a large room and spotlessly clean and we slept very well at night. When we arrived there was ' Happy Birthday' spelt in pebbles on the bed, as we were celebrating my husbands birthday while we were there. That was a nice touch and one that we greatly appreciated. The hotel is huge and to enable you to get around there is a train and in the evenings a boat, which is a novel idea! It is also good to stretch your legs with a stroll after a good evening meal !! There are many restaurants at this hotel and the ones we tried were very good. We ate at Boat Landing Cantina which is a Mexican restaurant, with tasty burritos and tacos. We ate at Dona and Toni's Pizza twice, which had a great view of the setting sun and a good range of pizzas and pasta dishes. On our last evening we ate at KPC ( Kamuela Provision Company ), the resorts fine dining restaurant. A great experience with wonderful food, sunset view and attentive service. Thank you Cornelius ! We had perfectly cooked steak and a very good Seafood Bouillabaisse. Desserts are to die for, if you can fit one in...While we were there we went to the Luau show at the hotel, which is a show about the history of Hawaii. It is well worth going to see and supposed to be the best on the island. There is a huge buffet that you can eat as much as you want and your drinks are included in the price. You can also just watch the show if no food is needed, but I recommend the feast if you can !! We had great weather whilst we were there and as it was whale season, plenty put on a show for us offshore. There is plenty to do on the resort if you are not out and about on this wonderful island exploring, as we did in our hire car which was a godsend. There is a lagoon that is linked to the sea that you can swim and snorkel in. Amazing experience as there are turtles and many varieties of fish swimming in with you. Surreal !! Also nice to sunbathe on the many sunbeds by the side of it. Plenty of great swimming pools, one with a slide, and also Jacuzzis that are open in the evenings as well, all set off by a waterfall centrepiece. We often enjoyed a nice swim and Jacuzzi at the end of the day. We never struggled to get a sunbed during the day even when we'd had a late breakfast. Talking of breakfast we had that every day and it set us up for the day ahead. Definitely recommend the eggs benedict! Yum yum... I must make special mention of the wonderful waiting staff at breakfast, David, Sally, Ulu, Desiree, Orly and Esther all led by Norbert. You do a great job guys and we would return if only for the friendliest start to the day and your welcome smiles. We spent a thoroughly enjoyable week at this wonderful resort on this beautiful island. Can't wait to return next year!! Thank you all..... ", " Amazing place. Loved the lagoon and having so much right at the resort. Pricey but worth it. Clean, beautiful spacious. And lounging in the lagoon on a floaty and a sea turtle swam by, so awesome. Loved every part of it. ", " Excellent Management & Excellent Staffing Yields Great Customer Satisfaction and a Wonderful Stay and Experience. This 62 acre property includes three separate towers of over 1200 guest rooms, three freshwater pools (two with waterfalls & waterslides), a four-acre swimming and snorkeling lagoon, a dolphin lagoon, nine restaurants and eight lounges, a museum walkway featuring an art collection valued at over $7 million which had opened as a Hyatt in 1988 and reopened in 1993 as a Hilton. This is all linked with a tram and boat that will take you from tower to tower to dining to beach to front desk to valet car pickup. Roll on a stroller, walker or wheelchair with ease, as of course it's all ADA ready. Now this resort is back even stronger with a Great General Manager, Debi Bishop, coming from Interstate one of the leading U.S. based global management company, who will personally leave everyone message to contact management or even her to make it right. When was the last time you heard from the General Manager of a Hotel.

Here's the list, Michael Chrinko, Hilton Honors, Jessie Gomez, Front Desk, Jim Russell, Operations, Simon Amos, Assistant Manager. If you stay here and something is not right they will make it right for you. All you need to do is ask them. Please ask them nicely as they truly want to help you. By the way, if you haven't done so already, join Hilton Honors there's nothing to lose and a lot to gain! ", " This is a beautiful, large resort with many amenities to experience. We stayed in the Palace Tower and the room was comfortable, quiet and clean. Each room has a lanai with chairs and a small table. The views of the ocean and sunsets are spectacular! While there's no direct beach to the ocean the lagoon is perfect for snorkeling - many fish & sea turtles to swim among. If you want to sit on a beach, head over to the Marriott either by foot or take a free shuttle ride (less than 3 minutes ride). As many reviewers have noted the resort is quite large with trams and boats to get you from one point to another. The walkways are decorated tastefully with many forms of art to view. I found the staff helpful and friendly; however, those working at the lagoon beach were barely tolerable (but I don't think they are employed by Hilton, rather Ocean Sports). Highly recommend the table side guacamole at the Boat Landing Cantina - it was delicious! While the fruity cocktails are tasty, they are overpriced and I'm guessing cheaper liquor is used as I had heartburn after each drink. Overall, we had a great stay! ", " This is one of the best Hotels I've ever stayed at. It has it all great views and fantastic rooms. The Restaurants are also very good. Many pools and things to do on the property. You can get in a pool with dolphins also. You can take a boat ride to your area of the hotel on a boat. ", " This hotel is huge! Several different pools, beach access, surf close by, stores near & enough fun to be had for more than one stay. Great place to just soak in all the sunshine & play. Centrally located on west side of island to hit things north or south from the property. ", " Overall, this was an excellent resort. Wonderful, friendly staff (especially Andrew on the boats who has been there for over 20 years!). Only downside is that the property is huge. We were in the Ocean tower and it was over 1/4 mile from the front desk to our room. So, if you don't want to wait on the boat (which run from 2-10) or the tram (6am-12am) you will need to be prepared to walk...alot. The boat and tram \"schedules\" aren't posted, probably because there really isn't one. We found if we needed to be somewhere and we cared how long it took us to get there that it was usually faster to walk. The pools are great and offer a variety of settings for different ages and activity level. The natural lagoon with turtles and fish is a neat alternative to snorkeling elsewhere, especially for younger kids or beginners. We would stay here again and bring our kids if they had accommodations to fit our family of 6. Unfortunately, their biggest suites don't fit that many people. Also, be prepared. You will need to spend an additional $50 per day...$25 to park yourself and $25 for their \"resort fee\". ", " Great for kids. Dolphin experience was popular with kids and elders alike. A boat and a train to get back and forth on the long property along the beach. Nice restaurants. All this is pricey, but if you can afford it, go for the premium (new) area closer to the dolphins. Especially for kids, waking up, going to the veranda and seeing dolphins in the pool right outside is just a cool unique experience. ", " I have had excellent service at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The hotel is beautiful, but you do pay a premium, so the service is what makes the rates really worth it. There are a few people who are exceptionally noteworthy, Owana and her team at the Kohala Spa (a must do), Kami and Holly for massages, Crystal at the pool (definitely rent a cabana, especially if you are fair-skinned like me!), and of course, Kanilyn for room service. As a human resource manager of 22 years, I would say that these people make the hotel what it is in the most important areas of the hotel, food, and spa. Enjoy your stay at the Hilton Waikoloa! An experience you will be glad you had. Hit up Kohala spa and eat room service, after a fabulous day at the pool! I stayed 7 days! ", " Beautiful Hotel in an Awesome LocationWe recently stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a Winter Getaway vacation. As a Hilton Diamond Member, we were upgraded to the Makai Tower with lagoon & ocean views, and were lulled to sleep by ocean waves, since the weather was mild enough to not require the A/C at night. The room was spacious with a private lanai and refrigerator, and microwave upon request.Another perk provided to Diamond members is a $10 per day per person food coupon, which we used to purchase lunch at the Orchid Marketplace. The Breakfast Buffet is extensive but expensive, and would be best reserved for a late breakfast or early lunch. The daily maid service was friendly and welcoming, and beds are turned down with orchids and \u201cLegends of Pele\u201d cards. The grounds of the hotel are massive, with walking trails meandering throughout the extensive outdoor art collection. You can also ride the tram or take a boat ride between hotel destinations. There is also abundant wildlife on the grounds, including wild birds & Honu (sea turtles), and a \"Swim with the Dolphins\" experience. Parking is valet or self-park, and there is a shuttle available to the King\u2019s & Queen\u2019s marketplaces. Overall, the Hilton Waikoloa Village is the perfect place to spend a Hawaiian vacation. Aloha and Mahalo! ", " We were on the Walikoloa and wanted to have a great time at the luau on the Hilton grounds. We made the reservation and treated with great service on Jan 28 2015. The show was a great success with my family of four people. The dinner and all the people wer great are we were treated like Kings. Thank you for a great evening. ", " My husband and I wanted a place to relax for a few days without any worries. We did not rent a car or take any tours. This resort is large enough and the activities varied enough so that we were never bored. We found the walkways throughout the grounds to be beautifully landscaped with lots of artwork and quiet meditative alcoves. The ocean views were spectacular. We took the tram and the boats when we wanted to give our piggies a rest. Although the resort had lots of guests, we never felt like we were in a crowd. There were always plenty of comfortable chairs near the ocean, the pools, or the lagoons. Families with small children, young couples, and retirees seemed to be engaged in all kinds of water sports, golf, and other activities. The Dolphin Quest lagoons were so much fun to watch. Their naturalist spent half an hour with us sharing information about them. We loved the hot tub under the falls. We thoroughly enjoyed the luau, not your Vegas style hula babes, but rather a celebration of the myths and history of the island. The breakfast buffet was huge with fresh American and Asian choices. Since the resort food prices are high, at dinner we took the $2 shopping shuttle to the nearby malls. We ate at two outstanding restaurants for very reasonable costs. All of our interactions with staff were helpful and pleasant. We left totally relaxed and planning to return. ", " We were part of a company trip. The resort is large and there is a lot of walking. But the grounds are gorgeous with plenty to see and there are benches or sitting areas scattered about so you can rest if need be. The staff is very helpful and our room was very nice. You would never have to leave the resort but the trolley runs to two local shopping areas if you want to shop. We rented a car at the resort and went sight seeing. Very easy and no hassle and returned it right to the valet. I don't know about the pool temp, we toured the island rather than swim. We did enjoy whale watching from the shores at the resort but didn't get in the ocean there. We loved the resort and hope to return!. ", " The Hilton has 3 very large pools: Ocean Tower is mostly for adults. I recommend renting a cabana for 2 for $50. It includes 2 cushioned recliners with a canopy, towels, and wait staff for drinks, lunch, or an iced towel. Worth the money. The Lagoon pool is more for families and has a sand pool area for smaller kids and close to the Dolphin pool (where the Dolphine encounter tours are). The kids like watching the Dolphins. It's also close to food and rentals like kayaks, snorkels, & paddle boards. The Kona pool has a slide for kids, but mostly adults are there. Bar is nearby with waiters. Nice waterfall too. The Ocean Tower has birds that nest there at night. They are VERY load from 7pm and start again at 4:30am. You can hear them from your room, but after a couple of days you start to ignore them. ", " Kind of like a theme park hotel, and pricey like that big one with the mouse, but then, you are in Hawaii. We like to walk, so big is good. However, after long days away from the resort, it was nice to ride back to our Ocean Tower on the boat, or monorail. Fun place, well decorated, outdoor art collection, fun lagoon with turtles, and fish. I suppose a fun place for families, and kids, but we traveled as a couple, and never felt like we were in kiddie land. We found private places, and quiet places. All good. We are Hilton Honors travelers, and found our usual comforting Hilton amenities here as well. By the way, many thanks to the Hilton Honors customer service personnel who helped make our stay top notch. We had a big fun week at this big island resort. Only downer: the in room wifi did not work, and it's not free. Fine meeting, and convention facilities. ", " We stayed for three nights in the Makai building in Lagoon Towers. Room was on main ground floor over looking the dolphin pools and the greatest ocean views. Sat on the balcony whale watching the whole time. (bring binoculars) The grounds are beautiful. Take the walk ways around the ocean The ones inside the building, are a hike in the past with all the statues and museum pieces. The pool with the water falls and slide were our favorite place to hide out. Having that coffee shop steps from our front door was nice. Staff were friendly and helpful with every aspect of our stay. Bell baggage people,valet parking,front desk and especially the girl that escorts you to your room. Thank you Hilton for giving us a great time. ", " This place is incredible with its train and boat ride to get you to your block! we preferred to walk the incredible cloisters! long corridors with traditional sculpture and exhibits plus great works of art on the walls. The bar was great and we had cocktails whilst chatting to all the other visitors who were so friendly. The taxi driver was even a gem! The room was vast and well appointed and perfectly comfortable. I would visit again in a heartbeat! we were on our way to Maui to get married so we had a wonderful experience of the Hawaiin islands. ", " We spent four days at The Hilton Waikoloa Village. We traveled with our two boys, ages four and seven. For once I don't know where to begin........The rooms: we stayed in Palace Tower. Yes the rooms are a little outdated but that did not bother us at all. More important to us as a family, they were VERY clean. We enjoyed our partial ocean view from the lanai. The room was big and it had a large walk-in closet to keep our bags out of the way. On the bottom floor was the DVD rental machine (included with resort fee), my boys enjoyed stopping there to get games and movies for bedtime. The room also had a mini fridge which was nice to keep drinks in.The resort: by far the best thing about the property for us was the endless opportunities for enjoyment. There were so many things to do, as cheap or as costly as you'd like. Around nine am every morning we would head down and watch them feed the dolphins. The dolphin experience was a little pricey for the age our children are so we declined to do it but nonetheless enjoyed watching them. The lagoon was perfect for my boys, they enjoyed the calm water, seeing the fish and playing in the sand. They sold sand toys there at the shack at the lagoon ($5 or $10 set to choose from), we thought it was worth it as we took the toys down with us daily. We purchased snorkel gear at the store by the lagoon, it was only marginally more expensive then had we purchased ahead of time and was cheaper then renting everyday. One word of caution, the walk to A Bay is not worth it for families. It is a long rocky path, the lagoon there at the resort is much better. We spotted a large sea turtle in the lagoon several times. The pools, although too cold for me, were great for the kids (see pictures - lol). Two of the pools had a long curving slide my seven year old loved. The pool by Ocean Tower had a couple of small (and I mean small) slides my four year old loved. They do not allow floaties or floatations devices on the larger slide, and there is a height requirement (I believe 40\"). The small slides have no height requirement and allow arm floaties. We went to the point at Ocean Tower daily and watched the sunset and seen some whales as well. At times they were very far away and hard to see, other days a little closer so I recommend looking every day and bring your patience!Restaurants: we did not dine at the fine dining restaurant, so I cannot comment on that. We did enjoy the grill beside the dolphin lagoon (I think it was called Lagoon Grill) for lunch. We also really liked the pizza place beside Palace Tower. They offered outside dining and the food was very good. Some reviews have mentioned going to the King or Queens marketplace down the road, maybe a mile, to save money. We tried it once but wasn't impressed. The food was only slightly cheaper and wasn't as good or convenient and the service there was terrible. We did find a lot of cheap souvenirs there at the market that made the trip worth it. We also purchased bottled water to take back to our mini fridge.Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, the resort is huge. That was part of the appeal to us. My boys never got tired of taking the tram or boat. It was a big part of their day that they looked forward to. Just outside the main lobby they had some large parrots and a young lady came over and put them on my boys' shoulders and let them hold it on their arms and took their picture for us to purchase. The boys enjoyed it although we forgot to go back later to purchase their pictures!All in all we loved our visit, we made memories that will last a lifetime. If you are a family looking to visit Hawaii I highly recommend staying here! ", " This laid-back ethos of the Big Island influences even the large scale Hilton Waikoloa Village. Even with all its numerous restaurants, canal boats and trains, ended up being a superb place to unwind.It's right about now that we have to admit that we were surprised.While similar in size to its sister property, the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Oahu, the HWV skips the Friday fireworks in exchange for rolling sea views and to-die-for sunsets.(Their signature restaurant, Kamuela Provision Company makes the best use of these assets and is renowned across the island as much for its outlook as for its fish.)Yes, there's a boat and a train to carry you from one end of the resort to the other - we suspect these are to handle to mass of crowds that hit from March to April (more on that below) - but they're charming in their excess.Just let your inner child off the hook and ride the ferry as the sun goes down. It'll take you beneath the colossal lobby arches of each accommodation tower and, for a major resort chain, it's hard to not be impressed by the design.Ironically, staying at the HWV, with all its similarities to other big Hiltons, is different to staying at a huge resort anywhere else. If you ever feel fatigued by all the convenience and luxury you simply jump in your JEEP and drive an hour to Saddle Road and get completely alone, lost and wild.The brilliance is that you get to experience two kinds of travel. One with all the extravagance you could ever need, the other with dusty, raw authenticity on your doorstep. The HWV and the Big Island merges them together, allowing you to appreciate the value of both. ", " Came back in May 2014 with family to eat lunch and walk around the grounds. I first visited and stayed with friends on golfing trips in 1993 and 1994 when it was the Hyatt Waikoloa Village and always stayed at the Tower suites.Back then it was a marvel of a hotel: tennis courts, golf course, dolphin encounter, and 3 different hotel buildings with different styles of decor all linked with the monorail, boat and walkways. And in 2014, it was still really impressive. The only things are that some parts of the landscaping/statues/decorations are showing their age and need sprucing up. This is a place for honeymoons and longer than three days vacation so you can really enjoy this place and drive around Kona side of the Big Island. ", " We rented three rooms for a family reunion, three generations included. Everyone was delighted with the resort: large comfortable rooms, fish-filled lagoon, grand pools, not too tacky luau, really interesting and lovely art throughout the grounds, views and beautiful landscaping. There were lots of things to keep the kids busy, though now we wish we had also checked out the childcare. Yet, the resort was serene and quiet for our entire stay. A couple in our group wished for more sandy beaches, more extravagant brunch items, but I would still give this an \"excellent\" rating. ", " The hotel & services were great. Housekeeping staff was friendly & personable. The Restaurant & Bars provided timely and efficient service so you get what you pay for. It is a great place to getaway and spend a few days without having to hop on a plane! ", " Everything was of great quality. Some of the dining may have been a little over priced, and the parking sure seemed to be over priced, but overall it is a worth while experience. Since the review requires at least 200 words, I will go on to mention that when we arrived, customer service convinced us to pay for an \"upgraded\" room. The room was nice, but the view was over looking the roof and you could not see anything else except the tops of the some trees. The shower was stand up and since we had our 2 year old daughter with us, we returned to the front desk and asked for a room with a tub to bath our daughter in. they happily obliged and gave us a room on the 6th floor with a bath tub. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for 3 nights over a weekend. Our room was very large and easily accommodated a family of 4. We chose an Ocean Tower double/double room. The room was very comfortable and clean. Great housekeeping department always had enough towels etc.So many restaurant options. The highlight was swimming in the lagoon on site. Great for swimmers who are not very confident and don't feel like being offshore. We swam with so many fish and sea turtles that get to come and go as they please. Even though it is such a large hotel we didn't feel like it was busy. Lots of pool chairs and lounges. Loved it. ", " Easily one of the hugest hotels I have ever been to, this hotel just screams relaxing vacation! The location is slightly odd, away from Kona and a little in the middle of nowhere, but just close enough that you can drive to Kona (kinda nice being away from all the action, but be wary if you want to go out and have a vibrant city around you). There's a tram that takes you around the hotel and lush scenery abounding everywhere! Huge lagoon and lots of things to do! Rooms should be nice, I stayed in the Hilton Grand Vacations nearby with full access to the hotels amenities, so I don't know personally but it should be more than fine! Great place for the family! ", " I like to walk four or five miles a day when on holiday. The Waikoloa Village is my favorite place in the world to walk. I start at Buddha Point and walk along the path nearest the sea, stopping by to see the dolphins in the lagoon, to the Kamuela Provision Company Restaurant (great sunsets - see separate review). I return to the Ocean Tower by walking along the path beside the train tracks, looking at the vast wealth of art and statuary.Some have said that the complex with its three towers and conference center is like a Disneyland. I think the Village is a beautiful blending of God's natural beauty with man's inventive design. The white foam ocean crashing over the black lava rock is spectacular. Admittedly the only beach is the man-made one on the lagoon, so if you need an ocean beach you should stay elsewhere, although you can swim with turtles in the lagoon. There are also a great number of pools and slides for swimming fun. These pools and the adjoining statuary add to the beauty of the Village. We made a few side trips (one to throw snowballs on the summit of Mauna Kea), but remained and enjoyed the Village for most of our five day stay. This is our fourth visit to Waikoloa and it gets better every time. ", " Stayed there for a week before going on a time share presentation with Hilton Grand Vacations. The hotel is excellent, the rooms clean and spacious, the staff very friendly and accommodating.When we arrived, I had a very inflamed knee and couldn't walk. They provided crutches and had security wheel me around in a wheel chair for 3 days. They could not have been more helpful.In order to get to the rooms, we had to take either a tram or a boat, and everyone was so very nice. The room had a fabulous view of the Pacific, with waves crashing and surfers.After 3 days, my knee was much better and I got to see some of the grounds. There is a very large collection of Asian art and sculptures and absolutely beautiful grounds. Everyone gave us recommendations for restaurants in the area and we had a wonderful time.I especially wish to commend Sheldon from the front door and the security staff. ", " Stayed here for 2 nights and upgraded into a room overlooking the dolphins lagoon. Wow! It was so cool overlooking them from our balcony and listening to them talking!! We also had incredible views of the ocean and the rest of the resort.We ate teppanyaki at the Japanese resort which although was expensive, was fun. I have however had better teppanyaki experiences here in Australia, but still a fun night out for the kids.The breakfast buffet was also amazing.The kids did the dolphin experience, which although was expensive, was really a once in a lifetime experience. They had a ball! The tidal lagoon was amazing and kids ( & hubby) had fun swimming with the turtles.This resort also had boats that ran at nighttime to take you from one end of the resort to the other as it is absolutely huge!! I felt like I was in Disneyland!! It felt so surreal and magical!! The resort also had several pools with big slides. It really is an amazing place.One thing I really didn't like we're the people from the beauty salon calling out to you trying to sell their stuff EVERY time you walked past. It was actually very annoying- I do want to be badgered - I'm on holidays!! It got to the point where you had your eyes down and rushed past, hoping they wouldn't see you. Hilton would do well for them to shut down or tone it down.Anyway, saying that, this hotel is well worth a visit as it really is one of the most amazing places I have ever stayed in the world! ", " Lots to say, i'll try to make it brief:This is heaven for families with kids - lots to do, see, beautiful, versatile, wow - this place is mindblowing.Two cons: 1. if you stay in the cheaper building you have a very long walk everywhere, about 1 kilometer from the rooms to the main area. If you like walking like we do, it's not a problem, just make sure to take it into consideration. They also have trains and boats you can ride to get to places but sometimes you can wait like 15 minutes for them to arrive. 2. It's expensive, they add parking fees and additional local taxes, make sure when you book that you are aware of the total cost.The rooms we stayed at were the older ones but they are really great. Don't worry about that, they have pools all over the property, an amazing dolphin area in the compound, sand pools, bridges, a lagoon you can swim with turtles or kayak, jacuzzis, really, so much action. You must have a car to go out, can't do without one. Like 3 minutes away with a car there is a cute outdoor mall with nice shops and food. Bottom line, this place is beautiful and full of attractions, it's a bit expensive but i think it's worth it. ", " The service was good. The room had a great view and was very quiet. The building we were in was away from the busy area. They have a tram but does not run frequently. It was a bit of walk back to the lobby to get auto, but they have interesting art along the walk way. Food was very good but a little pricey Overall had a good time ", " This resort has everything you could ask for. There are 3 towers to choose from and really you can't go wrong with anyone of them. We stayed at the Lagoon Tower. It was closest to the main lobby and more central to other amenities. Staff were very accommodating and friendly. There are several shops on the property for very good shopping. Close by there are 2 shopping malls with good shopping and very good restaurants within walking distance.The boat and train are fun to get around the resort to get from one location to another.We upgraded to the Makai, and the rooms were very nice. The rooms were recently upgraded and were quite nice. Not sure what the rooms were like ii the other towers, but seemed to be similar.The only negative thing about the resort was the price of the meals. Man are they expensive, however the food is very good. There are a couple of alternatives on site, a fast food place by the Dolphin Pond, for lunch, a Pizza restaurant which was good, Chinese or Japanese. We tried the Japanese, but not the Chinese. Nice coffee shop by the main lobby if you feel like having desert and specialty coffees, or regular coffee. Overall the resort was amazing and we really enjoyed our stay there. ", " The Waikoloa Village Hilton provided my family with one of the most memorable vacations we have ever had. The resort was so expansive that we never felt crowded. We had too many choices for activities and places to eat than we could squeeze into our short stay. The resort is set up in such a way that every age group could find a comfortable place to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. It was immaculate in every place, inside and out. The meals are pricey, but lower priced options could be found. The Dolphin Experience is not to be missed. It was expensive but so worth it as an experience of a lifetime. ", " We spent 6 days at this resort and it was fantastic - full marks all around - immaculately clean, great staff, great facilities - lots to do - Lei making, ukeleli and Hula lessons were great - they really added to our experience. The complimentary cabanas overlooking the ocean were a great place to enjoy the morning coffee. We stayed during January and we got to see Whales breaching right in front of the resort. The Kings and Queens shopping centers were close by. Loved the complimentary mono-rail and boat to get around the 62 acres. We are taking our grandchildren next - water slides, multiple pools, lagoon, snorkeling, kayak rental - lots for them to do. Great place! Cant wait to go back ", " Let me just say that a week is not enough time to do everything here. It took us 3 days to discover all the things you can do at this 62 acre resort. The food is quite pricey, but if you rent a car, like we did, there are some wonderful places to eat with the locals. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately we just couldn't do our favorite things at the resort and tour the island like we planned. The highway traffic is easy to navigate around the island. Our rooms were just average, we are used to staying in nicer, but it was clean and comfortable. Who spends their vacation in their room anyway?! If you want one of the complimentary cabanas you have to be one of the early risers. They go fast.My husband loved seeing the mongoose running everywhere and the beautiful birds and tropical fish just added to the experience. I awoke early one morning just to see the whales. I can only say, WOW. I didn't need to be in a boat traveling over the top of them to appreciate their power and their beauty. I could go on and on about the things we did and the things we love about this resort... All I can say is you need to go and find out for yourself. We're planning to go back. ", " we enjoyed the water activities-We spent time in the Lagoon, the slides were fast and a blast. It was clean and quiet and fun for the family-There is something for everyone. Just a walk around the grounds is an adventure. Drop dead gorgeous sunsets over the weekend too. We love our stay-cations here. ", " My wife and I just returned from another unforgettable vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. We received the room we requested, the restaurants were great, and the staff was superb. If you go, say hello to Romulo and Rose in the Big Island Breakfast Buffet - They will treat you like Royalty. We saw the most whales breaching offshore in recent years and learned the most this time about the dolphins at the resort.This resort is for people of all ages, however young children won't appreciate the paradise that this is and anytime my wife and I heard a youngster wailing we said, \"There's no crying in Paradise.\"We can't wait to return. I would hope that the boats start earlier once again. Do they real save that much by starting them later? We miss riding in them to breakfast in the morning.  ", " We opted to upgrade to the Lagoon Tower as our original reservations were in the Ocean Tower. The stay in the Lagoon Tower was awesome...view from the room included the Dolphin Quest facility, the Lagoon and, of course, a beautiful view of the ocean...can't do a description of this view just with words. Ate at KPC over looking the ocean at night...this was really a special experience for us on our 10th wedding anniversary. ", " You can ride a boat or take the tram to get to your hotel room or one of the many restaurants, you can swim with the dolphins, there are coffee shops everywhere, there is twenty acres right on the ocean with many hiking trails and a small golf coarse that is close to the volcano on the Big Island in Hawaii! ", " We stayed here the weekend of the Ironman World Championship. Despite the number of people service was still fantastic. We even volunteered to work the race route and had a blast. We're looking forward to coming back with the rest of the family. ", " My husband and I celebrated our twentieth anniversary at the Hilton Resort.  One of the best choices ever!Although, it was Very expensive. It was worth every penny. The views are spectacular!!! The service was beyond professional, friendly and helpful. The restaurant's provided a verity of different types of foods. And their is a shopping center (Kings and Queens) located a mile away from the resort . There's a few great places to dine at. Mahalo, The Bridgets  ", " Bring your own food or get food at market down the street cause food and drinks are outrageous,,,but beautiful place and great pools and lagoon for kids and beds are small,and is a ways away from kona downtown.Takes like 40 min if slow driver in front of you. ", " almost like going to disneyland for adults and having luxurey in a paradise setting view whales from the grounds or your room many restaraunts to choose from but a little pricey beds are comfortable and outside noise is pretty quit except for the birds ", " This is another Hilton Hotel that describes itself as a village. It's really more like the Emperor's seaside palace or a theme park. First surprise for us was the monorail that runs all along its length, then the boat that runs late afternoon and evening along a waterway that roughly parallels the said monorail. Taking it at night with all the features along the way seemed a bit like Pirates of the Caribbean or The Jungle Cruise without the music or commentary.It has by far the most impressive collection of Pacific and East Asian art I have ever seen and it's everywhere, especially along the walkway that leads to all the various towers. We stayed in the Palace Tower, which has a vast interior space open to the sky, which was an aviary around sunrise and sunset.It has several swimming pools but the biggest water attraction was the inlet leading directly to the ocean where you can , sunbathe, swim and commune with the sea creatures that make their home there (and are free to come and go, most notably a lot of sea turtles. There is also a large dolphin pool, with an area bigger, I think, than in any water park I've ever seen. I counted 9 dolphins who were very active. It was a real treat watching them as we had lunch.The whole place is a destination with surprises at almost every turn. It has a luau which has, for about a $40 per person savings, a show only option, which we took. It was quite entertaining with a Don Ho sound-alike and the most impressive fire eating act I've ever encountered.The next time we go to Hawaii, this is a must destination. ", " Awesome hotel. Have stayed there three times, each time in a different tower. The Lagoon tower is definitely the best and the Ocean tower the worst. Ocean tower is farthest from main entrance and parking and loudest due to birds and the proximity to the pools. The staff at the hotel is top tier. Never passed a single one that didn't speak. The only knock is there is no beach directly on the property. The \"A\" beach is a short walk down the coast maybe 5 - 10 min but well worth it. The A beach is very calm and the water is beautiful. At the Hilton there are many restaurants and you really don't need to leave the complex. The lagoon area is great for swimming and snorkeling. There are pools everywhere. Absolute great place to stay. ", " Just spent three nights with my family, total of 5 rooms, at the Hilton Waikoloa. What a fantastic weekend. The adults and kids alike had a good time. The rooms are spacious, it's fun for the kids to ride the tram and boats, and the multiple pools and slides are outstanding! Great family fun. The rates are competitive, the service is good and the food was reasonable.There are multiple shops and restaurants in the resort and on property. You will not be bored. In fact, you will need a vacation from your fun vacation. Perfect for families and friends get away. The resort fee includes free wi-fi. ", " Many have complained about this resort being too big. That may be true if only staying a few days. In that case you may not be able to explore the whole resort because it is massive! We stayed for 8 days and would have been happy if we had never left the resort however there were many things we wanted to experience since this was our first trip to Hawaii. It is true that it can take some time to get from one side of the resort to the other but the beauty of the resort makes even long walks very pleasant. The art pieces that are on display throughout the property are amazing. It is like having a hotel and a museum combined! Like everything in Hawaii expect to pay high prices for just about everything including food, parking, etc. By the way I highly recommend valet parking your vehicle. The walk from the regular parking lot is very long and the cost is not much less than valet. The staff were all very nice and accommodating. We had a Deluxe Oceanview room in the Ocean tower. While many have complained of noise from birds in this tower we did not have any issues with this. For what its worth we do usually travel with a white noise generator so that may have helped. We enjoyed the cantina in the middle of the Ocean tower and took the monorail often when we needed to get to the lobby or elsewhere on the resort. We saw many whales from our balcony which was absolutely spectacular! We can't wait to come back again! ", " This place is incredible. It is very large, but easy to access by tram or boat. The lagoon is amazing with great snorkeling. Very relaxing and enjoyable stay for my husband's 70th birthday celebration! ", " Overall, an outstanding experience with beautiful grounds and a variety of onsite experiences. The pools and lagoon were a treat. This hotel was within walking distance of shops and a deli. It was also a gorgeous walk along the clean beaches to watch dolphins and sea turtles. The Kohalo Spa was amazing and so were the fitness/yoga classes. I have traveled to the Hawaiian Islands many times and do plan on visiting this site again. I have also recommended to hotel to others. A truly wonderful and relaxing break. ", " We played at the Hilton Waikoloa Tennis Centre during our stay on the Big Island from mid-November to just before Christmas 2014. The facilities are great, and the staff are outstanding! We have stayed at tennis-centric resorts on three continents, and the Hilton Waikoloa was far and away our most enjoyable tennis experience ever. The energy and enthusiasm of the Director and instructors is contagious, and you can't beat playing a great sport in a stunning setting like Waikoloa on the Big Island. We had friends come out to join us for a week, and they enjoyed the tennis so much at Waikoloa that since they returned to Canada, they have changed from occasional players to full-time tennis fiends. We kinda feel the same way. ", " Upon walking into the grand foyer we were awestruck by the size and opulence of the estate. Canal boats and trains can take you to your room (you need to use them the place is so spread out!). A lagoon with turtles and tropical fish, whales (I saw 4 within 10 minutes from up on the point near budda statue). Rooms excellent, big and clean. Plenty of eating options with many restaurants to choose from, also bars for an evening cocktail. All staff friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this resort. What a wonderful introduction to Hawaii!! ", " This was my first time to Hawaii. I loved the resort. This is a gorgeous place. We could either walk the resort or take the monorail. It is a very big resort. We enjoyed the bars especially the one near the lobby. The meeting places were spacious and the food was very good for our meetings. I would definitely stay here again!!! ", " I was planning an anniversary trip to Hawaii, and considered the Four Seasons on the Big Island, but decided rather than stay one week at the Four Seasons, that I might consider staying three weeks at Hilton Waikoloa. I was a bit apprehensive but checked into an ocean view room that reeked of cigarette smoke. I called the front desk and they moved us to an ocean front room at no additional charge. The property is very large, but my wife and I enjoy walking and did not mind the hike at all. The food was very good, and we really enjoyed having 13 restaurants to choose from. While the experience is not Four Seasons quality, we were quite happy to be spending three weeks in Hawaii, rather than one week. We finished our trip with an additional three days at the Four Seasons and it was fantastic. That being said, the Hilton staff was very courteous, the room was special and well serviced and it was a great time. I highly recommend the property as a good alternative to $800 a night. Thank you Hilton! ", " I have been staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for over 16 years....during that time I have toured many other hotels in the area and have yet to find one that offers the same beautiful grounds and value. I find their staff extremely friendly. The facility is large, and there will be a lot of walking, but I enjoy that. ", " Not only was the hotel amazing but our experience with rentals at Ocean Sports was fabulous too. Crystal that helped us was awesome! Once you stay at this resort, you won't want to stay anywhere else. ", " Hotel is vast. I do not think I have ever been to anything so magnificent. To get to the room you have tram or boat provided. Rooms are clean and nice. View was nice golf course and ocean in the distance. We did time share tour and got special card for discounts on our excursions. Really makes a difference when you have 4 children. Staff was very nice and friendly. Kids had great time. I personally did not enjoy Luau food was cold, show was long but I think because did not have enough alcohol in me. Kids loved it though. Could not listen to \"auntie\" songs. We did tour of volcanoes and we watched manta rays at night. My kids jumped from the South point. My 6 year old did it too and the man who was watching us said he was the youngest he has ever seen to jump. He did not want to do it again. It is scary but fun. Time share was not for us. I would love to go back but not every year and I like to explore different hotels although with Hilton you now you get quality. ", " I am another one of those travelers that have stayed here 10,15 years ago. Yes, overall it is an older resort, but they have kept everything beautiful!You can not beat the facilities. There is so much to see and do for the kids. The rooms, like bath tiles can receive a facelift, but we only slept in the room. The negative:self park is now $25 a nightlots of walking (hard with little ones) and hard to find elevators to maneuver with a strollereverything including a cup of coffee is expensiveThe positive:the groundskids campmuseum art through out animals from nene, flamingos to dolphinslagoon safe enough for kids to snorkel with ocean fish and turtlesdespite the size, the room areas were quiet ", " Wow. there are not enough pictures that can do it justice. There are boats and a tram to take you around to different spots within the resort. The breakfast/brunch is spectacular with a great view. We swam in the lagoon which had fish and a sea turtle within the hotel area. There are a series of interlocking pools which we didn't quite get to explore. Wonderful place- we would love to return. ", " We went to the Christmas buffet. Our server Kenith was quite handsome very friendly awesome service although he couldn't accomidate me with some crab legs he did bring some shrimp and champagne mahalo for a great Christmas weekend away from Kona . Aloha heather ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village was a great place to stay, it had a tram, a boat ride around the property, and a ocean fed lagoon inside. They also have a hallway full of musuem artifacts that are lovely. I don't really encourage you to go the Dolphin Quest, because it doesn't really look that entertaining. The Christmas Buffet and the service were very friendly. This Hilton can keep you busy for quite a long time. Although one thin is, the food is expensive and the price of the stay is expensive. Otherwise, it's a hotel that's worth a stay. ", " There is something for everyone here. Great restaurants, wonderful pools. The scenery was breathe taking from the whales and sunsets off Buddha point to the Lava rocks each view is breath taking. The cultural events daily were fun as well as the Hawaiian events. A great place to relax, and do whatever you please. I typically get bored easy but that didn't happen here. ", " Great hotel, self enclosed. Highly recommend the hotel guest discount card for the restaurants in the hotel. We tried the restaurants and it was good. Hotel was located next to some of the best beaches on the island. ", " My husband and I went here for our honeymoon, and we LOVED the site + the staff. The best part by far though was how well they took care of us concerning allergies. I have a lot (really, a lot) of very uncommon food allergies, and the whole staff was most excellent and cooperative in making sure we ate and ate well. They helped create a schedule for us that would be safe and allergen-free, and the chefs of all the restaurants were more than accommodating and understanding. It was more than we could have hoped for, as we were ready to eat peanut butter sandwiches all week if need be, and we ended up eating like royalty for every meal. If you have food allergies of any kind, I would highly recommend this resort + restaurants for staying/dining. I simply contacted the resort prior to our stay, and the desk connected me with head chefs. Most of the time it is very difficult/frustrating/scary to eat out with food allergies, but I felt safe with all the chefs and staff here. Highly recommended! ", " My dinner buffet with family was the best ever ... Also the weekend stay..... Our server Kenneth was very nice and helped us allot and showed the Aloha spirit. That we live our selves and love to see all the time...... Aloha Lana ", " This hotel has it all, seriously!!! Such beautiful grounds and so much to do. Didn't need to leave the hotel to experience beautiful Hawaii. The food at the Cantina restaurant was great, and the hotel transportation via train and boat was amazing. The view of the ocean from the point where the Buddha is at, was breathtaking. The only thing we didn't like were all of the Hindu gods and Buddha statues all over the place, it was kind of creepy :-( ", " We got put up here after our flight home was delayed overnight. Big resort. They have a tram! It's beautiful though. They have a whole lagoon that is connected to the ocean you can snorkel in or paddleboard or canoe or water bike. They also have a dolphin research center with lots of Dolphins that you can watch while you lunch. You can also pay for a dolphin experience. The food isn't bad, the rooms are nice. The ice cream sandwiches are to die for...huge and delicious. ", " the grounds are beautiful, staff very attentive. it's a large resort, so be prepared to do some walking. numerous outdoor dining options, many offering great sunset views. make reservations days in advance during holiday stays. ", " This is an incredible vacation resort, the people are friendly and helpful, the staff is incredible and the resort has so much to do. The ocean lagoon was the favorite place for the kids to see fish and touch turtles. I highly recommend heading out to the other side of the island for zip lining. ", " Stayed here for four nights before checking into our two bedroom two bath timeshare! Had some serious issues with our first nights room, but after talking to Kenneth the manager, a very efficient, and qualified man, we were upgraded to a very satisfactory room over looking the dolphins pool area! We would return to the Hilton at Waikola on the island of Hawaii. ", " We had a wonderful time. Love riding the boats at night with some hot choocolate. Wish the boats ran during the day time as well. The water slide was great as well. Buffet was yummy and we may have eaten too much. Couldn't decide what to eat to much to chose from. Can't wait to go back. ", " This is a magnificent and massive resort. It was spotlessly clean and the attention to detail was obvious, Disney World without the rides. We stayed in room 5072 on the 5th floor of the OceanTower with a spectacular view overlooking the ocean. My bride and I used the monorail to get from the check-in desk to our room with our luggage. There is no convenient access from your car to your room . The interior courtyard of our unit was filled with lush vegetation and a much appreciated very quiet adults-only pool.The negatives were expected so I did not let them influence my rating but you should know what they are. Everything at the resort is VERY expensive, even for Hawaii. If you don't have a car, I suggest you take the shuttle to the small plaza next to the hotel for various sundries and maybe a carryout wrap for lunch by the pool. The hotel is self contained but in the middle of nowhere, 15 min. drive to the airport and another 15 minutes into Kona. I was aware of the daily resort charge but still found it VERY annoying.Would I recommend this property to a friend? Yes, just as long as they know what to expect. ", " Beautiful resort, loved it. Will certainly stay here again. The staff is the most friendly and helpful I have ever experienced. Wilma in the main bar area was so helpful and made us feel welcomed after a long plane ride. ", " We spent our honeymoon vacation here and it was such an amazing experience! You can easily just stay in the resort since there is so much to do. We had a blast swimming, snorkeling and kayaking in the lagoon. There are several restaurants on site but are pretty costly, however Dona and Toni's (pizza and pasta) is reasonable and extremely tasty! There are lots of shopping options at the resort as well. Would highly recommend staying here and plan to stay here again next time we visit the island! ", " We stayed in a Presidential Suite - Palace Tower - 6251. It was a great room, well appointed - though the piano was out of tune - seriously! The bathroom could have been a little cleaner and the room service could be much better, but on the whole it was a very good stay. ", " What a fantastic resort! It is huge and spectacular. You can walk or take the train inside the resort to get around. There are several pools, a water slide, and many great restaurants. There are Dolphins on site who live there. They also have beach areas where you can snorkel or just lay out. We saw many sea turtles by just snorkeling within the resort. The ocean water within the resort is open to the sea so the sea animals can come in and out as they please. This was so by far our favorite vacation we've ever taken. ", " Me and my friends were on Hilton Waikoloa Village, which is getting extremely popular around the world. It is spread over several acres and you can find everything you might need. I knew that Hilton was known with it food, but however I impressed with it restaurants. Here you can also find dolphins, which are definitely beautiful creatures and Pacific Ocean is in front of you. I think, that this experience cannot be replicated. Before I decided to go there I have read one fantastic blog, which content is definitely true. Here is link: https://hiltoncomtmtp.com/book-hilton-waikoloa-village-on-your-next-vacation/ . I believe, that Hilton Disney resort would be greater than Waikoloa. Thank every Hilton Hotel employee for such a good service. ", " I stayed here for 2 nights. Upon arrival to the hotel we checked in and had the layout of the hotel explained to us with a map. This is a really big hotel! There are shuttle trains running very frequently which will take you to different areas of the resort. We stayed in the Palace Tower which was about the third stop on the train from the main reception area, I think you could walk instead of catching the shuttle train but it's handy when you have all your luggage with you. Our room was spacious and clean, the decor is a little dated but it's not terrible. We had a balcony with a beautiful view of the sea, beach and palm trees. We rented films free of charge from the lobby of our tower and watched these on the PS3's available in the room. We explored the surrounding area and the resort which is pleasant, there is lots to do here if you are bored. The staff were friendly when approached and there was a generally happy atmosphere. As it was our honeymoon, a chilled bottle of champagne was left in our room with a congratulatory note, to me this was a really nice touch and showed thoughtfulness and that they are interested in their customers. There is a great shopping centre just down the road from the hotel (about a 10-15 minute walk) which is easy to find and has clothes shops, Starbucks and a supermarket. The main issue I had with this place was it's location, it's quite far from the airport, we caught a taxi which cost around $50 each way. We could have rented a car but this does cost money to park at the hotel as well. Overall this was a nice hotel and I would happily stay here again but I would look for cheaper transport to the hotel (maybe they offer an included shuttle from the airport)! ", " I wasn't even sure they would let me stay in a place like this! It's immense ! More like a museum or an art gallery, it absolutely beautiful ..useful train and boat to get you around , but we walked everywhere to appreciate the sculptures and artwork...everything you could ask for in a resort ...it was a little on the pricey side but it is a Hilton so kinda figures ..would recommend if you want to chill out and do nothing...it can be a bit difficult to get tours to pick up but most will get you from the Kings shops which are only a $2 bus ride away...certainly one of the most plush places I've ever had the pleasure of staying in ", " This place has so many resort fees but has an amazing view. Its on a beach with great dining, several amazing pools and Jacuzzi's all over the property. The parking lot is far. They charge you for parking which sucks because its on the resort... they also advertise this time share class where if you sit through, you get all this free stuff. I feel that's wasting time seeing the island. The room was no where near as fabulous as the lobby and the tram. It didn't match. Loved the wild turtles and swimming with the dolphins was awesome! Make sure you go to the shopping center and buy your own water and snacks. ", " This hotel is in a lovely setting and was truly paradise! The service was excellent and the food was very, very good. Rooms need updating but, all in all, it was an excellent value and a very enjoyable experience. ", " I absolutely loved the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort! The setting is absolutely breathtaking. Our oceanfront room provided us the opportunity to listen to the waves and watch whales breaching right off shore. The amount of wildlife on the resort was incredible. From the sea turtles and tropical fish in the lagoon, to the parrots and dolphins, there is so much to see and enjoy. The service is also exceptional. Everyone at the resort was beyond friendly and accommodating. I had a particularly great experience at the Boat Landing Cantina. Not only were the margaritas awesome, but our server/bartender, Scotty, was so nice and personable. He is most definitely an asset to the Hilton Waikoloa as a whole. Another can't miss event is the Luau. I have been to many, and it was by far the best I have ever been to for both the food and the entertainment. The fire dancers were absolutely magnificent! I could go on and on about how amazing this resort is. It far exceeded my already very high expectations. The management is certainly doing an outstanding job! ", " Even with the bird \"happy hour\" noises starting early for about an hour, the resort is great. We stayed in a renovated room in the Lagoon Tower that overlooked the tennis courts and ocean. The bed was great, the room large, and the walk-in glass shower was so big that we could have fitted all of our Thanksgiving guests at one time.Walking was enjoyable and hopefully burned some calories gained from dining.Be sure to dial \"54\" from your room to make a reservation for the Kamuela Provision restaurant. We were seated literally at the edge of the ocean about 30 minutes prior to dusk and it really enhances dinner. The blackened ono special was incredible.Birds are not a problem at the restaurant probably due to a wandering cat on patrol that passed our table. Since it is open air my cat allergy was not affected.The Big Island breakfast has a buffet although we opted for a la carte. The omelet was good and there is a big pot of coffee provided.Although the Kirin chinese food was good, it was not outstanding. Perhaps it was because the high standard bar set by the seafood restaurant tempered our enthusiasm for it?Kids will like the monorail & the boat ride. Be sure to check out the hotel website prior to going to make sure you get your bearings.We rented a car at the Kono Airport. From our hotel it was about a 1.4 hour drive to Hilo and another 25 minutes to Volcano National Park. This is a \"must\". Be sure to ask the hotel staff for the short cut to Hilo via the Daniel Inouye highway if your stay on the Big Island is short. ", " The property is beautiful and the service is excellent. The food in the restaurants was not very good. Overall is a great hotel with excellent facilities. The location is on the best side of the island and the area itself is beautiful. Great golfing, scuba, some shopping nearby and the sunsets are wonderful. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. ", " The views are fantastic, weather perfect. We have to admit however that the hotel furnishings are getting old. The food in all of the restaurants is really good - yet expensive! Save your money for this trip and for sure do it! ", " We have stayed at this property 5 times in the last ten years. Best overall Hotel on the island for families. The lagoon pool with live marine life and the dolphin watch keep kids busy. Really clean, great restaurants( but premium hotel pricing), courteous workers. take a tram or gondola to your room-kids loved this!(like Disney!) Definitely would stay here again. No onsite beach( due to lots of Lava), but the lagoon area still feels like it! Views of the water and grounds are amazing! Pools are really cool with water slides and fun, just the water temperature could be a little warmer! ", " excellent, clean, beautiful setting I live on the other side of the island and really enjoy the sun and beautiful trade winds. I also enjoy the kama'aina rate. The unpleasant part of this trip was the extremely long wait to check out of the hotel. Both lines for regular and Hilton honor checkouts were extremely long and I waited for approx 20 minutes to be serviced. Suggestion that more workers work to help check out guests during the checkout time. ", " My family and I went on a family vacation and were greeted by wonderful service! First at the pool slide in the lagoon tower pool, Brandon was the sweet young man manning the slide. He timed my entire family along with the others using the slide so we could all race! Fantastically fun! Next we rented a cabana that ended up being a bust in the sense that the sun was beaming directly into it the whole day, after the majority of the day passing with our cabana unused we encountered Britney, who not only comped our cabana for the day but also told us to help ourselves to any open cabana! Score! Then there was Roger, the extremely helpful server who made sure my brother received the blueberry cheesecake ice cream he had tried the day prior that today was not on the menu! All and all this resort not only is beautiful but everyone who works here seem to not only love working here but also care about the service they are providing to their guests! Thanks so much again to Brandon , Britney, and Roger for you wonderful service! ", " Our most recent stay at Waikoloa Beach Hilton was the perfect end to an outstanding visit to the Big Island. Looking down at the surf at Buddha Point from the Ocean Tower, we enjoyed gorgeous sunsets in the evening and equally gorgeous moonsets in the morning. Spacious room; great location; good food and drink; cheerful service everywhere. We have yet to be disappointed in any aspect of our stays here....other than that we must eventually head home. ", " The Hilton is a fabulous resort with everything a family needs for a wonderful holiday.Our kids loved all of the activities.My husband and I joined in the tennis clinics several mornings during our stay. We had so much fun that we highly reccomend playing there. The instructor Liane was awesome!We had a perfect holiday. ", " Beautiful resort with excellent customer service. The Concierge actually greeted us upon arrival and checked us in. It was nice to be serviced immediately and not have to wait in line. They also accommodated us with an early check-in, as we arrived just after 2:00 pm. Thank you for the superb service! ", " The only draw-back was the tram took so long to get to the Ocean Tower plus the boats were not running. When you are on a short timeline, that makes for a more organized stay if we knew ahead of time that the wait was going to be an issue, so we opted to walk, but with a 3 year old child, that proved to be a challenge.. Other then that everything else was excellent. Thank you ", " I had a chance to stay at Hilton for 3 nights for a conference that I was attending in nearby Marriott, I could not get a room at Marriott since it was packed and I am glad it was. Hilton proved to be a resort that I decided to come back to with my family. The resort is HUGE, with a spread that needs you to use a train (or boats in the afternoon) to go to your room from the lobby. Multiple pools with a huge lagoon seemed to be a hit with kids. Whatz not to like about Dolphins on the property :). I did not get a chance to actually swim with the dolphins because I was on clock but you bet I am going to do that with the family soon. The room was clean with a view to beat. I had a partial ocean view in the Ocean Tower. I can only imagine what oceanfront rooms would feel like.Negative: Expensive average food...but its a norm in Hawaii esp in big resortsExpensive parking: Again, something you have to live with in a resort like thisI recommed this resort for anyone with a family looking to spend time in Hawaii. ", " We live in NJ and come to Hawaii every year. We had bought a timeshare in Maui and usually always rent condos on the islands. We rented a condo on the big island which didnt work out. Keahou surf and racquet. See my review. So we found the hilton as a emergency place to stay. Wow. Glad we did. We booked a room in the palace building. Top floor one bedroom 1.5 bath suite. Room 7285 corner room. There are 4 balconies with chairs. Each with a different view. So many activities. Since its January they are only about 45% booked. This place has a train and boat to take you around the entire resort. Truly a place we will now be returning too. Thank you Hilton for saving our vacation.  ", " Wonderful hotel. Great amenities. Clean room, comfortable bed, super views. But be advised, this is a huge hotel complex so don't expect to go from the front desk to your room, to the restaurant, to the bar, to the beach, or to the ballroom in a hurry. You either walk, board a train or embark in a boat to go from place to place. Nice, for sure, but time consuming. ", " This property is one of the most beautiful that I have ever stayed. The property has everything you need for a fun filled vacation. Great rooms, perfect view, shops, bars, food, swimming with dolphins and access to people on staff that can arrange any off site activities. The staff were over the top. They make everyone feel welcome and important ", " Absolutely everything you may need in Hawaii rigth at one place. Excellent rooms, excellent stay. Two amazing weeks in my life, \"never-to-be-forgotten\", really great place and experience, you will enjoy everything at the maximum possible level, but your wallet or bank account will be crying! Breakfast for 30 bugs, lunch even more, but Waikoloa shopping centre is approx. 20 minutes walking in beautiful landscape. A lot of cars that one can rent here and see all the Big Island beauties (4x4 cars required when going to the top of Mauna Kea). It was very expensive, but I'll stay here again, absolutely amazing experience at all. ", " resort is huge, grandkids 3 and 7 loved taking either the boat or train to get around the resort. stayed in ocean tower, only negative is the birds start arriving in the evening, and they are pretty noisy during the night, impacted the sleep of some of the guests in our party of 8. ", " We planned on staying just one night, however extended an extra day because we once again found the resort so much fun! Freda at the front desk was wonderful and gave us the same off season rate for the 2nd night. The perfect time to visit this resort is in off season, Jan-Mar. It was u crowded, and we could whale watch from our room or the shore! The Kamuela Provision Company restaurant on site is wonderful, albeit quite expensive. The rooms are terrific and quite large. We opted for a Lagoon suite on 4th floor which gave us a wonderful view of the bay, dolphin lagoon and snorkel beach. The pools are large, with waterfalls and water slides and spas. Bust a wonderful place to relax! And the staff is amazing!! Rates during off season are good, especially if you take advantage of their email discounts. Love, love, love this place. Been coming here for 20+ years and its still one of my favorite places on the Big Island. ", " My Partner and I visited this resort to celebrate my Birthday. Check in was quick and receptionist very friendly and informative. On my Birthday Housekeeping left a special surprise for me in the room and KPC provided a special desert all ading to a wonderful time. Trams and boats are a lovely way to travel around the resort. Sunsets are amazing, resort is clean and staff helpful I cannot fault this place and would love to return one day. ", " This hotel is by far one of the nicest place my husband and I have stayed at. Great rooms, great service and always felt so very special. You want to go to a place where you feel like you being there is important to all the staff, then this is the place to go. ", " This is a great resort. It has everything you could want or need. It is massive - spread over three towers, with a monorail and boat to help you move among them. Several different eating options means that you don't get bored with one style of food. Our favourite was the Mexican cantina. My only complaint (mentioned by others as well) is the temperature of the swimming pools - way too cold. All of the staff were helpful, but I'd like to make special mention of Sally, our server at breakfast. She was very attentive and polite and made our mornings. ", " This place is the best for bus., couples, family, friends or if you wish to hangout solo. Always friendly and relaxing! We enjoy the Hilton Waikoloa as our Stay-Cation! Thanks for such a wonderful memory! ", " We were married here 10 years ago and were once again delight with the resort and friendliness of staff. We had a superb experience. And saw tons of sea life in the on property lagoon! Highly recommend this resort. ", " My wife & I along with our son & his wife were here for a week. Having the shuttle bus to get you around was a major plus not only for shopping, restaurants but to see the emencity of the property. As an older traveler this was a plus. While my wife & I had been here several years ago, so much has been added. From the pools, lagoons with tropical fish & turtles ........... well, it's just heaven on earth. ", " I am a planner and researcher when it comes to vacations and this one was a big one for us. I have read previous reviews and kept them in mind while planning. We just returned from our 8 day trip to Hawaii this past weekend and it was one of the best trip we have ever taken. Our stay at the Waikoloa was amazing!!! I highly recommend spending extra if you can and get a room in the lagoon tower. We stayed on the 6th floor overlooking the dolphins, lagoon, and the beautiful ocean. The room was very nice, clean, and housekeeping did a great job each day...no birds waking you up here! It was in a great location to walk to the lagoon, pool, restaurants, luau, and much more. We actually found it very easy to walk the property and enjoyed it. There are some great little shops and the tram and boat ran about every 10 min. The lagoon was AMAZING!! It was actually better than ooour snorkeling trip as we saw sea turtles galore, eels, parrot fish, monk seal, and all kinds of other fish. My kids (8 and 5) thoroughly enjoyed spending many hours there snorkeling and paddle boarding.The lagoon pool was very big. They had a great smaller pool connected to the big pool for little children. They also had a waterslide that my girls loved!As far as pricing yes it is expensive but you need to keep in mind it is Hawaii and expect that going in. Cocktails are around $12-14 while beer is around $6. We dined at the KPC which is a must simply for the view! We did not pay the extra for guaranteed lanai seating but we were sat there anyway. The food was good not exceptional except for the coconut creme brulee which is a must have!! The italian restuarant was mediocre nothing special. The luau was great!!! We paid the extra and got seated front row right in the middle. Unlimited drinks plenty of food and great entertainment!We also rented a car at the hotel. Quick, easy, affordable and a nice way to see the island! Would recommend to anyone and cannot wait to go back! ", " Expansive vibrant grounds lead the guest to all things beautiful! This Hilton has got it right. Expect some walking but well worth it. The one thing lacking would be that all amenities including restaurants and lounges (there is only one that stays open until 11 pm - say what?) Do not stay open or offer late night socializing. All else is wonderful. ", " Whatever you want, whatever you need, they have it here. Places to sit and have a Kona coffee in the morning. Talk to Paul and he will fix you up with a skinny coconut mocha. Talk to Ashley at The Lagoon Grill and she will get you a burger, fish and chips or a grilled cheese while you watch Dolphin Quest and enjoy the waves of the Pacific crashing on the shore. Stop by The Malolo Lounge to have a night cap and a pulled pork slider...Mmmmm. From the Valet to the reservation desk to the housekeepers, the staff of Waikoloa Village do their best to make you comfortable and relaxed. This resort is awesome and I look forward to returning with the family for another Hawaiian Adventure. Keep up the great work! ", " The Waikoloa Hilton has it all on one of the most beautiful properties in the Hawaiian Islands. The amazing property, with lush landscaping, views of the Pacific over to Maui, pools with waterfalls and slides, a lagoon filled with tropical fish and turtles where you can snorkel or rent paddle boats, canoes and more to explore, several tempting restaurants and eateries priced to meet your families budget, and miles of Pacific Rim artwork and artifacts. Whether you walk around the grounds or take the train or boats, you will find lots to see and do. The property also offers a chance to swin with dolphins for a fee. When the kids were younger they referred to this Hilton as a Hawaiian Disneyland, because it was so much fun and there's so much to see and do. The miniature golf course is another favorite activity. The resort has two golf courses, but my family rarely plays them because the tend to be flat and uninteresting, although some holes offer gorgeous views of the Pacific.We've stayed at this property over 20 times and still travel back regularly. Our family has grown up, but it's still our first choice when visiting Hawaii. ", " Beautiful location and grounds with lots to do for kids of all ages. Really appreciated the many pools including the Lagoon snorkeling on days it was a little rough at the beach for the kids. Great staff as well. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a very beautiful place and one of our favorites in the islands. Be aware, it is a large property - it was 1 1/4 miles from our room in the Ocean Tower to our self-parked car. My wife and I actually enjoy meandering the property but heard a lot of people complaining about it. They do have a train and boats to get about but we rarely used them.If you have a strict budget, make sure you read the fine print. There are add-on fees for many items. We rarely use some of the things but I could see a family getting sticker shock upon check out. Wi-Fi is extra but all the bars have free wi-fi. I am a Hilton Diamond, so that isn't an issue, but be aware. There is also a add-on resort fee daily.All the employees we met were very friendly and accomodating. We got a lot of tips for things to do not in the guidebooks. We especially like mixing with locals so those tips were helpful.The restaurants are generally good although there is a shift to more of a food court affair rather than individual restaurants, I'm not sure if I'm really crazy about that.If you want to save on your food budget, head down to the King's or Queen's shops. We walked but it isn't far. You can especially get good happy hour specials that served as dinner for us. At \"Tropics Ale House\" we had sliders and a pizza for $10. Rooms are fine, standard King room for us. Our favorite is the Ocean Tower where we could watch the sunsets from our lanai. It is also the farthest out from everything. There is a refridgerator in the room also so we brought some beverages with us after store trips. You can not have your cooler, drinks, etc. at the pools. So for us, it is a perfect place to stay but just be aware of the little extras. ", " I had the chance to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in 2010 and I really enjoyed it. I still remember all the beautiful moments I enjoyed with my family and I have always thought to go back when I have a chance. So I was curious to read what other people say about this hotel, and to my surprise and disappointment, I read so many bad reviews. I want to apologize upfront, but I totally disagree with all these bad reviews. The hotel was in a nice location, very clean and maintained. The view was breathtaking. My and my family enjoyed the walking around the hotel property. When I came back to Boston, I had never felt so relaxed, almost re-born. The hotel is large and expanded, but it offers a train and boat service, both very enjoyable, especially the boat ride. The restaurant might be expensive, but only a couple miles away is a small shopping area with a grocery store and also fast food restaurants, if you want to save some bucks. Definitely a vacation to remember. This hotel is the best choice and a great value for Hawaii... If I have to go back to the big island, Hilton Waikoloa would be again my first choice... ", " My husband and i came here almost 12 years ago before kids and loved it. We loved it just as much when we brought our 7 & 9 year olds. This is a great place to come and relax and spend time together as a family. Between the two pools and the lagoon, my water loving children were in heaven. It was declared better than Orlando despite having no Harry Potter themed amusement parks. We had fun at the lagoon trying out the paddleboards and kayaks. The views are amazing. For a hotel there is a huge amount of animal life roaming around the grounds, in the water, and flying in the air. We loved it. There are lots of activities around the area that you can book on your own or through the hotel. ", " My husband and I have been fortunate enough to return for our 4th visit to this lovely property. The staff is friendly and very helpful. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The rooms are clean and the grounds outstanding. This setting is truly picturesque! ", " After a year of eye surgeries and stress, a week in Hawaii and especially a week on the \"Big Island\" was in order. Although the Hilton Waikoloa Village is HUGE (63 acres, they say) my wife and I never felt overwhelmed by the sheer size of the resort. Considering the throngs of tourists/families in the resort at this time, it was still fairly quiet. The monorail system runs the two or three trains regularly enough that the time spent waiting to be moved from one area to another is never overly great, and the \"train\" is supplemented in the afternoon and evening hours with a couple of motor launches that wend their way throughout the property. If you prefer to walk from place to place, the walkways are available to take you from one end of the resort to the other, while entertaining you with murals, paintings and statuary from the Far East, The landscaping is amazing and adds to the \"tropical paradise\" feel of the place. ALL of the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. As a retired military officer with a bad knee and replacement shoulder, I had no problems walking the grounds to take in ALL that the resort had to offer. Lt. Col. Gary P. Hanson (Ret.) ", " Very much enjoyed the stay. Such a beautiful property... large and meticulously manicured. Terrific and accommodating staff, and great places to relax and enjoy the scenery. The one issue I had was when I arrived to my tower (Ocean) debarking the tram, I had no idea where my actual room was located and there were no signs indicating the location. ", " We stayed here for two nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We were amazed at the extent of the grounds and activities available for guests. Firstly we got a great rate on our partial ocean view room which was on the top floor of the Palace tower. It was very roomy and had everything we needed. Then we enjoyed the grounds and just exploring the paths and gardens. The pools were great and not very crowded and they provided towels for you as well. The main lagoon looked popular with lots of people trying the different activities like paddle board and snorkeling. We loved stopping by to watch the dolphins swimming and playing at the dolphin quest. They were so beautiful and great entertainment especially at night when there wasn't many people around and you could enjoy an ice cream from the cafe nearby while being entertained by the dolphins. Food was a bit more expensive but it was good too. We enjoyed dinner at the pizza place, the Chinese place and the ice cream shop for dessert. The coffee shops served a nice hot chocolate and banana bread at a reasonable price too. They have a monorail or boat you can catch to your part of the resort or you can just walk which we did quite often. The putting course was good fun too and also a great place to watch the sunset. Internet, DVDs and a few other activities are included in the resort fee which is great. Only negative is self parking is $25. We would definitely stay here again. ", " I travel for a living. Most weeks I spend 2-3 nights in hotels. When I take time off of work, the last thing I want to do is stay in another hotel.The Hilton Waikoloa blew away my expectations.From the moment you arrive you are welcomed with true Aloha spirit. Smiling faces, friendly people, and happy families dot the open foyer. The Train comes right into the lobby or you can wait for the next boat about 10 steps further. Both have their next arrival time displayed on a stanchion at each stop. (Note: the train and boat time is also shown on one of the hotel channels to help plan your days). Many on this site have had negative reviews do to the size of this place. I fail to see this as a negative. Each individual \u201cTower\u201d has restaurants, pools, bars etc. By no means are you forced to walk from end to end to go about your daily routine. If you do want to get to the far end of the resort then the air-conditioned train is both convenient and efficient. The Restaurants are fantastic. If it is in your budget, The Kamuela Provision Company is amazing; easily one of the top 5 meals in my life. This place is as romantic as it gets with a view of the ocean sunset and Maui on the horizon. The pools are pristine. If you are up early enough you will see the maintenance scrubbing the pools, pruning the surrounding foliage and setting up the cabanas for the day. The Kohala pool has smaller water slides for the little ones and has fewer people than the larger Kona pool. My Daughter was proud to count the number of times she went down the larger waterslide each day. (She topped out at 30). Reviewers have complained about the resort fee. I think it is worth every penny.The Lagoon was a favorite for my little ones. Soft sand and a snorkeling opportunity for them without the threatening waves was awesome. The Hilton Hhonors Benefits are perfect. I find the coupon system much better than free breakfast. I am not a Big Breakfast person and have no need for a daily buffet. Having the coupons to use at our leisure makes much more sense. Access to the spa is a huge benefit as well. If you are an early riser, the spa is virtually empty. The Steam room, Sauna, Workout facilities etc., are all top notch.I am not sure how there are those that can say negative things about this place. Some truly had me worried. Rest assured, the staff is amazing and the facility is impeccable. We will be returning to the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " Excellent vacation. Fun and activities for all ages. Anything you would want to do from golf to swimming, snorkeling, snuba, scuba, all available at one place. Location convenient to the airport, the city of Kona and the sights of the north coast. ", " I go to the Big Island a few times a year and this resort has it all. If you have kids, they've got all the amenities to keep them active. If you are going with another adult, you don't feel like you are at Disneyland with a bunch of kids. The resort is very large, but doesn't feel crowded. Shuttles are available to take you shopping but I would still rent a car. ", " This was my 2nd stay at this property and always thrills me to be there. It has everything so in a way its hard to see the rest of what the island has to offer because you just want to stay at the resort it has so much to offer. The locals call it the Disneyland of Hawaii and you will see why if you stay there. I love this place and hope you will too. ", " I had the best stay ever. And the grounds are amazing !!!!! I ate at the breakfast and it was amazing. The service in the hotel was outstanding . Valet was quick and always had cold water waiting me in the car. Maid service was top of the line. and the boat and tram where a great way to get around. I can't say enough about the best hotel stay ever !!! ", " There are plenty of things to do here. Be sure to experience the dolphin quest. My one regret because I didn't participate! Restaurants were expensive but the Imari was well worth it! They have great Japanese food. The tram and canal boats were nice but we didn't mind walking through the resort to see all the displays. Very quiet and restful room. ", " This was the best vacation in Hawaii, the Hilton has a beautiful property that is so family friendly. There was something to do everyday, free of charge for the kids. The pool was excellent, the best part a lagoon to swim in with amazing turtles, puffer fish - all friendly and captivating. ", " Beautiful resort! Comfortable beds/pillows. Ice machine on 1st floor was out of order the whole week. Not a big deal. Trams were exceptionally slow! After a few rides, just decided to walk to locations instead of wait for tram to move! Great exercise. Food was way to expensive, especially breakfast! ", " My husband and I recently celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary with a 10-day trip to the Big Island, having been married there - and Hilton Waikoloa is always our \"go to\" hotel for the Big Island. The location of our room could not have been any better - in the Lagoon Tower in one of the Makai rooms - with views of the dolphins, the lagoon, the ocean, and even the pool. We never bored of watching the dolphins, sitting out at least once every day to watch them. Restaurants were great as always, with KPC being worthy of two visits during the stay - and the same dishes both visits - short ribs for my husband, surf and turf for me. We were sad to go - and look forward to many more future stays. ", " We spent 5 days there. Room was spacious, grounds were lovely. No beach on property. Ate every am at the great Hawaiian buffet. It came with our room and it was very good. Lots of choices, fresh fruit etc .Concierge at the ocean towers was excellent. Her name was Caitlyn. She arranged a number of side trips for us . Definitely rent a car. We drove to the volcano. Amazing at sunset . Took a helicopter ride, pricey but worth it. Blue Hawaii air. ", " we stayed here in October. the check in was very fast and friendly service. we stayed in the makai tower. a beautiful room, very clean. and a nice view. we celebrated a special birthday and were given a bottle of champagne! that was a nice surprise! the resort is big, but when you are on vacation, does it really matter? one afternoon at the poolbar we met reina, she is fantastic. thank you again reina! we have absolutely no complaints about Hilton Waikoloa village. ", " Simply beautiful! We stayed here for our honeymoon and we couldn't be happier with our choice!I wanna say thank u for our server at KPC (Robin) she was awsome and kind and thank u for the free drinks to the restaurant maneger:)) mahalo ", " Located approximately 20 minutes from the Kona Airport, Hilton Waikoloa Village is the perfect resort to stay at while visitng Kona. The resort is VERY spreadout but offers a water taxi and tram as transportation on the resort grounds. The pool areas are perfect for relaxation and the lagoon is perfect for snorkeling. For those individuals wanting to be closer to the lobby, I recommend booking a room in the Lagoon Tower. The Lagoon Tower is closer to the hotel lobby and resort pools. The resort is convenient to shopping and several restaurants. ", " Check-in was more than efficient, thorough and quick, even though we arrived early. Property is expansive but pleasant on-site transportation to rooms. Room was large, clean, quiet and tastefully done. ", " This is the best resort we have stayed at. The property is large and lush but the rail tram and water taxis make it very easy to get around. If you do not want to rent a car they also provide shuttle bus service to the shopping center which includes restaurants and grocery and shops such as Macy's and Tommy Bahamas. A car is a good idea for trip over to Volcanoes National park. We did not have children with us but this resort is full of activities including a Dolphin Experience. We recommend you check out their website. ", " Tho place is huge. It has snorkeling, paddle boarding, swimming with dolphins, luau, severs pools, several restaurants, spa, etc. Etc. The list goes on and on. If your not careful you could only go here and not actually see the rest of this gorgeous Island. We rented a car and went everywhere. ", " Loved this hotel! All the staff was friendly and helpful. My daughter scrapped her leg on a hike and the front desk gave us band aids twice so we wouldn't have to buy them. The valet always gave us water while waiting for our car. The hotel photographers were taking photos but never pressured us to buy them (even though we did). Alice was a great photographer and worked hard to make my son laugh for the photos. When booking excursions, Grace went the extra mile in answering our questions and always remembered us when we ran into here later (around the property). The pools were fun and grounds were clean. The only thing that was hard was the place is so big it is hard to get from our room (in the ocean tower) to the front desk. Very long walk and the tram moves slow. Other than the walking the entire visit was outstanding!! ", " The Waikoloa Village Hilton offers not only several pools, both salt and fresh water, but also several exceptional restaurants (my favourite was the Kamuela Provision Company, awesome food, breathtaking view) and activities (including an interactive dolphin show). Additionally, the hotel offers a very well kept botanical garden with fabulous exotic birds and a very interesting museum walk, with gorgeous asian and polynesian art. I have stayed at several resorts on Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island, and the Waikoloa Village Hilton is my absolute favourite. A great experience indeed! ", " Great hotel which is very kid friendly. It has a monorail in the hotel to transport guests from one wing to the other. Has a adult only swimming pool if you want to relax in a quiet environment. Has a few pools including a man made beach. Even got a dolphin pool where you can sign up to swim and take pictures with them. All in all, a great resort hotel where adults and kids can have great fun. ", " Hilton Waikaloa is my family's FAVORITE hotel anywhere!! We loved it with kids...and we're loving it as a couple. The pools, especially the big Kona pool, are absolutely the best anywhere! And I have to mention Brandon, the guy at the slide. He really made us feel like family!! The restaurants are all good, the rooms are AWESOME, the boats, the monorail, snorkeling in the lagoon, the art walk...I could go on and on! ", " The rooms are wonderful, the service is great and the property is excellent. It's huge and just beautiful. You can take a water taxi to get around or a monorail, or just walk. The sunsets are gorgeous! We had a room between the dolphin exhibit and the pool, best location in my opinion! Could watch the ocean, the dolphins and the pool. The pool is out of this world!!! It's huge with a grotto and waterfall, bridges and beach area! It's expensive but everywhere is there. I would most certainly go back if I get the chance!!!! ", " we had the opportunity to vacation here during the iron man competition in early October. This resort is beautiful with a lagoon, boat and train system to help you maneuver the large property. Those of you who like wheel of fortune, pat and vanna film from here often. Sunsets are out of this world. I would recommend this hotel to both couples and families ", " Fantastic place to stay. Lots of people complain about the car park, monorail etc, but I was glad I didn't listen and went anyway. Would thoroughly recommend it to everyone. We were there during the hurricane in August and they made us feel safe and secure. Can't wait to go back in fact already booked. ", " What a wonderful resort! It is maintained in perfect condition and the artwork that line the walk ways is a real educational opportunity. Lots of pools to choose from and the ocean swimming lagoon. Plenty of dining options for all tastes and budgets and a very friendly staff. Waikoloa Resort is full of energy and fun. This is a great place for families or romantic escapes. ", " This is the best place in Hawaii to vacation or attend a business meeting. Excellent staff and plenty to enjoy. Fabulous sunsets! Many pools and activities. Excellent shopping on site or a short distance from hotel. ", " i stayed from September 21 - September 29th 2014 .. I requested an upgrade and I received the best upgrade anyone could ask for ! The Lagoon over looking the dolphin quest !!! My 4 year old grandson loved it . ( I enjoyed waking up to hear the Dolphins my self ) we did go the the lei making class and feel in love with Megan that taught our class ... If you get a chance please stay ... ", " We have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village five years in a row, and it gets better every time. I would have to write a short book to fully elaborate on all the reasons we think it is outstanding and exceptionaly memorable. For the sake of brevity, here is a list, in no particular order, of what we love about the resort (and I probably forgot a few things):The stunning view of the ocean, dolphins, lagoon, and grounds; The comfortable attractive rooms, bathrooms and beds; The expansive beautiful grounds, gardens, and waterfalls; The awesome works of art, sculptures and statues, especially the Buddhas; The swimming pools, especially the Kona pool, with its huge water slide, suspension bridge and waterfalls;The wildlife - dolphins (the Dolphin Quest program), giant sea turtles, mongooses, wild cats, beautiful flamingos and other birds, interesting fish, especially the jumping fish; The restaurants, especially The Kamuela Provision Company (our special thanks to Lily, Tiffany, Rowena, Thelma, Jordan, Julio, Warren, and all the chefs); The Legends of Hawaii Luau - see my separate review of this outstanding dinner and show; The great nightly music (we love to dance) at the Malolo Lounge; The meticulous care the entire staff takes to make the grounds and facilities immaculate, beautiful, and welcoming;The outstanding customer service - the staff goes out of their way to make your stay superb - nothing is too much to ask of them; The gorgeous coastal trails and beaches in either direction along the ocean;The wonderful spa, fitness center, and shops on the grounds; The peacefulness, as well as the tasteful, lovely and interesting architecture. Our thanks to all the wonderful staff. We hope to return many more years. ", " My family and I (two teenagers, two adults) stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa in October 2014. I was originally concerned about the hotel because reviews mentioned how big the property was and how hard it was to navigate around, find things, etc. Perhaps because I was expecting extremely long walks, my opinion is that it wasn't bad at all. I found the walk to our room from the lobby very pleasant. We almost always walked instead of taking the tram because it was faster to walk and I liked the exercise. I didn't find the distance a negative at all. I quite enjoyed the walk along the shops. It took about 8 minutes. Not a big deal. I would, however, highly recommend the Lagoon Tower. It's on the best side of the hotel, closest to the biggest pool and water slide, the gym, A Bay, etc. If you can afford to upgrade to a Makai room, do it! It is worth it! We had a fantastic view of the ocean, the dolphins, a pool and the lagoon. It was seriously one of the best views I've seen. Simply amazing. Ask for a room that overlooks the big checkerboard and you won't be disappointed. You also get a separate check in with Makai and other various perks around the hotel including premium seating alongside the lagoon at breakfast. You get a special wristband that tells the employees you are a Makai guest. The parrots are awesome in the lobby and we found the staff really extraordinary. They went above and beyond on many occasions. The only downside I would say is that when we wanted to do anything, go to dinner, etc., it is about a 35 minute drive to Kona which is where every excursion we took left from as well as the majority of restaurants. It's not bad to do it once, but every day gets a bit boring. It's like commuting which I didn't want to do on vacation. Although I loved the hotel and my kids loved the amenities, I would probably stay in Kona if I went back. If you are planning to just stay at the hotel and the surrounding areas, the Hilton Waikoloa is fantastic. We loved it. ", " Attending a conference at the Hilton Waikoloa - I was very impressed with the detail, service and overall beauty of the property. Having been to the Big Island before, I knew the island was a great place but the Hilton incorporates the wonderful surroundings into an excellent experience. ", " I finally got to return to this hotel and this beautiful locationunfortunately it was for business only, the room I stayed in was 202, it had a great view and was very clean and well presented as far as the design and the practical purpose of using it to organize all my work information. I tried several of the outlets as well as local restaurantseveryone was very helpful and supported me in any of my needs, the front dest was also very supportive ", " This Hilton is fantastic. I live about 30 minutes away and bring my family here at least once a year to stay. They offer everything you would ever need. The huge property hosts pools, water slides, a tram and boat ride for transportation around the resort. There are several very good restaurants as well. I highly recommend staying here. ", " If Wheel of Fortune films shows here you know it must have something very special. From the train that takes you from one end of the property to the other it is a Disneyland type of Hotel. There is so much to do you hardly want to see the rest of the island. Beautiful setting, Beautiful surroundings. Only down side is that going from the parking lot to my room took 20 minutes walking and taking the train. If I did not take the train there is a great walk way filled with Asian art..but then it is at least 35 minutes from parking lot to room. Their breakfast buffet is great but pricy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants something out of the ordinary..but then so are the prices for the middle class person ", " Best vacation I have ever taken! We spent 4 incredible days relaxing by each of the pools and enjoying the grounds. The property is kept in perfect condition and every where you look the view is amazing! I especially enjoyed all the artwork on display inside and outside the hotel buildings. The place is so big there is a train that will take you from one end of the resort to the other. Don't want to take the train? Then take one of the boats that run through the canal that winds its way around the resort. In short this place is stunning! ", " Huge resort which takes 40 minutes to walk a full circuit of. Very impressive with lovely views over the ocean. Two great pool areas and a lagoon where you can hire water craft. Well equipped gym one of the best I have ever used in a hotel. The resort has plenty to see and do if you are willing to pay the price. Meals are expensive ($20 for a burger with no fries) and if you don't have a car its a fair hike to the local shops.For a relaxing family holiday however this is the perfect spot to unwind and let the kids play and enjoy the space.Huge rooms, comfortable beds, quiet and clean.The service has been overall average with highs and lows in friendliness and consistency - which is not the Hilton standard we come to expect.The buffet breakfast is good but the service is patchy for example one morning our gluten free toast came really quick then another we had nearly finished eating before it arrived. It is a long walk from the lobby to your room and if you're lucky you can get your bags on the tram otherwise expect a good 1 hour wait for a bellboy to bring them for you - by the time our bags got to our room we had already explored half the resort and had a burger, means the bellboys miss out on a lot of tips I guess.Activity hire is expensive for the amount of time you get $25 for 30 mins. Wifi is \"free\" but you are charged a resort fee of $25 a day to cover that and DVD hire whether you use them or not.I rated this 5 stars overall though because we were able to relax and chill out, the resort wasn't too crowded and noisy and our room was very quiet. After working in high stress jobs all year this is exactly what the doctor would have ordered and my son has had a ball which always makes for the perfect holiday. ", " We stayed here as part of a reward from my husband's business. It was our first time away from the kids and this was the perfect place to be. We took the monorail to our beautiful room but we walked everywhere the rest of the time. The resort is large but it doesn't take long to walk anywhere, especially when the weather is so nice. Our room overlooked lush green surrounds with a small balcony that was perfect for reading a book before breakfast. The only fault in the room was one powerpoint that stopped working. We spent a lot of our time at the Lagoon, snorkelling, paddleboarding, relaxing in a Cabana. We FaceTimed the kids from in front of the Dolphin pool, which thrilled them no end. Breakfasts and dinners were arranged for us but we ate lunch at the Lagoon Bar, beside the shark pool. We both got a massage from Judy, who worked wonders! We attended three evening functions while we were there and the food at each was really nice, particularly the Coconut Creme Brulee. Our favourite waitress was Cora, she was such a happy delight and always gave us a giggle. While we were longing to get home to our kids by the end, especially since the hurricanes were coming, we had such a fantastic, relaxing holiday. We'd definitely return with the kids one day. ", " Went for sales club, and had a wonderful time. The Hilton Waikoloa is a beautiful resort, about 30 mins north of Kona Intl Airport. Grounds are immaculate, and the buildings impressive. Beautiful views of the mountains to the east, and spectacular oceans views to the west. There is not a direct ocean beach on property, but a 20 minute walk away is \"A\" Bay, where there is a fine public beach, good (not great) snorkeling, and first come first serve beach chairs. Hut for snorkle gear, beach toys, etc. The Lagoon Pool at the Hilton, is big. Nice and cool water, plenty of space. The lagoon itself also has some nice snorkeling, with some resident sea turtles. The best spot though, is the area around Buddha Point, nice and quite area looking over the bay and ocean, with cabanas. Loved the service we got from here, especially Mardi. What an asset and pro. The rooms were spacious, and well kept. The staff was very very friendly and efficient. We really admired the art work shown between buildings. This is a big resort, so be prepared to walk/hike, or you can take the tram or boat (a little slow though). ", " Daughter picked this hotel and it was excellent. Like all the hotels on this island you have to make do without a beach, but it has everything else! The highlight was swimming with (captive) dolphins - they do seem to look after them well and are into education. My concerns about having captive dolphins were outweighed by the care, education and overall professionalism of the staff. Swimming with wild turtles and fish that come and go from the main lagoon was another highlight. We mainly ate at restaurants elsewhere in the area as the prices were quite high at the resort. ", " This resort is absolutely amazing!! We did not want to leave and can't wait to return. It is beautiful in every way imaginable. It has everything you could possibly want and need. We really appreciated the tram and boats, the boat rides were amazing. We stayed in the Makai (Lagoon) Tower and had an breath taking view and it felt like we were sleeping with the dolphins!!! The Spa experience was also amazing. ", " Awesome experience. Very family friendly and excellent services. Grounds on the resort are beautiful. Food is average at best and overpriced, but that is to be expected of a resort. The pool and hot tubs and sunset views of the Pacific were spectacular. I would recommend this resort. ", " We stayed here for six nights for our honeymoon, and it was a great choice for us. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, which was recently renovated. Even though we weren't in the fancier Makai suites, our room was large, the bathroom was really nice, and the bed was comfortable. Our \"garden view\" room had a nice view of a roof and parking lot, but you could see the ocean and the volcano in the distance, too, which made up for it. This tower also seemed closer to a lot of things, so I would recommend staying there if you have a choice. We only took the tram when it happened to be pulling up in the lobby (though be careful - one time we ended up going in the wrong direction and it took three times as long to get back than if we had just walked). We only took the boat one evening to get a view of the rest of the resort.The pool and lagoon here are great. The public beaches were closed for part of the time we were here, so having the ocean fed lagoon was a lifesaver. We still got to enjoy the ocean, despite the fact that we couldn't go to the beach. We rented snorkel gear and were able to see some really cool fish. The Kona pool is great, with a really fun water slide. The views are incredible and the property is gorgeous. A-bay is nearby and they have a shuttle. If you rent a car, which you should, other amazing beaches like Hapuna beach are close by. Go early in the morning (before 10) to avoid the crowds.We were originally supposed to stay for five nights, but Hurricane Ana caused our flight to change. The front desk was so helpful, even though we booked our room through United Vacations and not through the hotel directly. They extended our stay and even let us stay in the same room, even though someone had been scheduled to check in. I was so grateful for their help.The staff in general was super helpful whenever we needed something. We forgot our toothpaste, and the housekeeping staff brought some right away. People were generally very friendly and welcoming.Yes, everything here is expensive, but if you know what you're getting into, it's not so unexpected and outrageous. If you've ever been to a Disney resort, it's similar in pricing. Meals are expensive, though the more expensive restaurant we ate at, KPC, was a better value in that we paid what we would pay for a nice meal back home (vs. overpaying for burgers and fries at the Lagoon Grill). Some restaurants are better than others (KPC was great). The resort fee of $25 and parking fees add a lot to the cost. You just have to know this going in, because it's unfortunately a fact of staying here, but if you know this ahead of time and plan for it, as we did, it's workable.One weird glitch was that Imari, the Japanese restaurant, took reservations on Open Table for a day it wasn't open, so check with the hotel first if you plan to eat there. They were only open on Monday and Wednesday evenings when we were there. ", " our hilton experience in Hawaii was just excellent we would recommend this hotel to everyone. if and when we go back to the big island we will diffently stay there again.. the hotel staff was very polite and helpful in every way that they could. the snorkle lagoon was one of the best experiences in snorkling that we could of found being beginners ", " It is a great resort, very big, with a variety of restaurants from reasonably priced to quite expensive. There is a happy hour on somewhere most nights. The real selling point is that the resort has its own lagoon where you can snorkel with sea turtles and tropical fish. You can hire canoes and stand-up paddle boards as well. The accommodation is very well appointed and the grounds are beautiful. It has a tram and canal boats to ferry guests around. ", " Good hotel with plenty of places to have fun, swim, snorkel. Was there on a business trip, conference rooms are well equipped. Food in the few restaurants we tried was horrendous, so try to eat outside. Luau was a good experience, but definitely VERY over-priced. ", " The Hilton Waikaloa is an excellent family experience. 2 large pools with a lagoon connected to the ocean (but quite safe) make it great for the whole family. Very relaxing atmosphere with lots to see & do. As with all resorts, most activities cost extra so this won't be a cheap stay. The lagoon was a highlight, where beginner snorklers will see a lot of different fish & turtles! We weren't able to enjoy the restaurants but the Japanese place looked good. Be sure to check out the Ale House on the hill outside the resort for some good beer. ", " Went to Kona for business and pleasure. Was blown away by how grand this hotel was. What a tram to get to my room, how exciting. I immediately thought I need to bring my kids. The room was huge with a great view and the service everywhere was excellent. I'm returning with family! ", " I stayed here in July while working a conference being held on-site.There's really nothing I can think of to complain about. The place is enormous, has a tram and boat travel system, all sorts of things for everyone of all ages to do, and to top it off, they also handled a large meeting very efficiently from an events standpoint.I hope I get the opportunity to stay here again! ", " Excellent Hotel in every way from the Staff and Service to the cleanliness Swimming with the Dolphins and the Lagoon was a BonusI would recommend the Lagoon Tower for a spectacular view and easy access to all the resortHas to offer ", " We recently stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at Waikoloa Beach (a wonderful time share resort) and decided a week on the Big Island wasn't enough, so we booked a couple extra days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Hotel resort. This is an amazingly large resort with wonderful ocean views, beautifully manicured grounds, many pools, restaurants and bars of all types, a fantastic display of mostly Asian art work throughout, shops, tours etc. Probably the best views and grounds of any resort we've ever stayed at.You get to your room on a tram ( that looks like a small lite rail train), on a boat on their canal system (where you can also arrange for private dining from one of the many varied theme restaurants) or you can walk...very nice walks if you are not pulling luggage. We even passed a oceanside church service Sunday morning that had a Hula Dancer as part of the service. Much to see and do from golf courses to close-up dolphin experiences to paddle boards, kayak and peddle boat rentals to Luaus, entertainment (America played the weekend before we arrived), beach lounge chairs both at the many pools and along the ocean side along with many more private cabanas you can reserve. Many varied types of restaurants. An amazing place!This is a high end hotel, so be prepared to pay for everything...$$$$ for parking, drinks and meals, renting equipment etc. Hilton Honours members do get free WiFi and it is available at several pools and bars throughout the resort, too. Otherwise that is $14.95 / day. There are of course spa and massage facilities located throughout the resort and many high end shops along with a large convention centre, plus most others services offered at fine hotels worldwide. The concierge desks are always available to book all types of activities and excursions for you.All the staff is very pleasant and helpful, which adds to the resort's ambience.Try a few nights or book a package when travelling to the Big Island!You won't want to leave. ", " we stay here EVERYTIME we visit the Big Island. I cant say enough about how amazing this place is. They have trams and ferrys that shuttle you around the resort as it is HUGE and walking takes awhile. Lots of little \"shopping centers\" within this resort. We always stay in Ocean Tower and get AMAZING views of the ocean. We also pay for the breakfast buffet which includes omelet stations, waffle stations, drinks, any food you can think of. There are several pools throughout the resort with water slides and waterfalls. A dolphin pool area to see dolphin shows and swim with dolphins, lots of restaurants, lots of beach. Its a must do when in Kona!! ", " A pleasant surprise for a family holiday on Kona. A 30 minute drive north of Kona airport through a lava moonscape, you arrive at the Hilton Waikola Beach Resort. We had a room in the Ocean wing. Close to the pool , about 10 mins walk to the lagoon pool. Wild turtles access the lagoon pool and you can swim with them. Bring your snorkels with you. The rooms are spacious and a roll out bed was provided at no extra charge so our daughters could have separate beds.The only down fall is there is you need to allow 20 mins to get from your room to the car park. It seemed to take the same time to walk or to catch the tram. But we were on holidays so we didn't mind. A well stocked ABC store is nearby selling great pre-prepared meals for lunches or dinner. Also a cheaper alternative for breakfast. A great coffee shop was located at the bottom of the Ocean Wing. The watersides in pools were a big hit with the kids. The Hilton is also well located for the drive to the Volcanoes national park along Hwy 19. It takes about 90 mins to drive the Hilo and 2.5 hours to drive to the volcano national park. Beware - there is a $25US charge compulsory resort fee charge plus a $19/day charge for parking your car (self parking). A car is a must if you stay here. ", " We have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa a number of times over the years and have always found our stays to be thoroughly enjoyable. The hotel is spacious, spread across three accommodation towers accessed from the main lobby by a tram & boat network which are always on time & efficient. For those wanting to walk, it's a short 15 minutes from reception to most towers.The sprawling complex has islands of birds in the lagoon network, including Nene's, a number of pools and their own sea water lagoon containing sea turtles and tropical fish. There are also numerous dining options on the property from simple cafes & bars, to fine dining options. The Kohala Spa is one of the best we have experienced on any of the Hawaiian Islands, and service across the entire hotel is impeccable. Our favourite time of year to visit is around Christmas when there is a special magic about the property, beautifully decorated and plenty of children's activities.The hotel is located approx. 30 minutes from Kona Airport and has a number of small shopping malls close by - it's the perfect location for a relaxing holiday and for those who don't want to do too much. Activities can be organised including trip to Volcanoes National Park - though be warned this is a full day excursion due to the size of the island, and rental cars on The Big Island are extremely expensive one all taxes etc. have been included - as a guide - 3 days on The Big Island was the equivalent of a week's car hire on Maui.We thoroughly enjoy every visit the Hilton Waikoloa and look forward to many many more ! ", " this place is a copy of fantasy island. Boat and tram takes you to your tower. The grounds artwork I can't even describe.$6 million worth of art throughout the grounds. Swimming with exotic fish, green sea turtles was awesome. Dolphin pools and shark pool on the grounds were beautiful. I would definitely stay there again. We had an incident in one room, but staff was more than happy to change our room. Overall, the hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. ", " We stayed down the road at Kings Land (more of a one bedroom suite vs a hotel room) and had access to the grounds at Hilton Waikoloa Village. We mainly went there to enjoy the huge pool and to look at the dolphins. As the reviews have stated before this place is HUGE!! Just getting to the pools from the parking takes about 10-15 minutes. It's great that the hotel has a tram to take visitors from one end to the other. The toddler loved the pools and we went two out of our five day stay in Waikoloa. Can't really say what the rooms/restaurants are like, but we really enjoyed the pools and the beautiful views of the ocean. ", " I have been coming to this resort since I was twelve years old. Twenty years later I am bringing my own family here and it is always fantastic. I have stayed here on over twenty different occasions and never have I been let down. If you ever need to just escape, this is the perfect resort to do just that. My last trip here was this past Fourth of July weekend. A long weekend turned into a week after we extended our stay because it was just too good to leave. Relaxation and loads of fun awaits! ", " Well we knew that the Hurricanes were on their way to The Big Island (of course the week we had planned for over 8 Months) We traveled with 6 Adults and 4 Grand kids) When we got there Check-in was a Breeze and where in our rooms with in 20 minute the Staff at the Desk were very Professional and very Helpful. They explained every part of our room and (Ocean View Tower) When we go to the Room was Very Spacious and Comfy the Bed was wonderful. Next day we explored the Complex what a Great Layout and Lots to do with the Grand Kids lots of pools. The Night Glow Golf was a Nice Treat for them too. Our Grand Kids did the Dolphin Experience they Love it (3) year Old and (7). During the Hurricane the Staff kept us up to date with Bulletins on The TV. Then to Top it all off the Next morning we felt a 4.5 Earthquake!! The Grandkids still talk about that.. Will stay there againDaniel and Janice ", " Spent several days here with extended family. Amazing rooms and they had lots of things for families to do during the day. Located near Queens and Kings Shopping Plaza, dining and gift needs are easily met. Well worth the investment. ", " We were mildly surprised as we left the lava fields between Kona and Waikoloa and arrived at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. As we entered the lobby and looked through to the Resort's lagoon we immediately felt tension leave. After a quick and helpful checkin we made our way to our room in the Ocean Tower part of the complex. The room was spacious and had a great view of the golf course and ocean. The Village is well laid out with numerous pools, one of which is an adult only pool. We enjoyed the tropical drinks available from the nearby bar. Be sure an avail yourself of the $29 meal and drink card, you will pay for it many times over as you save 10% on every meal and drink. The main lounge is roomy and had great entertainment on the night we visited. The Kamuela Provision Company, great food but an even better sunset as seen from the out door seating area. The resort has numerous walkways throughout the complex which allow your to stroll through the grounds. There is also a tram system running from one end of the resort to the other or a boat system that follows the tram system running from 2pm to 10 pm. The employees of the resort are outgoing, friendly, helpful and courteous. the only downside to our stay is that Wheel of Fortune was filming during our stay and the set was on our side of the complex. Several areas were limited by the activities of the show and the crowd noise was loud especially on the first night. If we had known the impact this show was to have on our stay we would have booked a room in the Lagoon Tower portion of the resort. We will definitely return to the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort.If you plan on staying at the Resort be sure and go to the nearby Lava Lava Club for dinner. The sunsets are SPECTACULAR as you sit feet away from the beach. The food was outstanding Mai Tai was great. Look for the nearby Cat Refuge as you stroll to the restaurant. ", " There are numerous publications that prepare you for what you will find. If you want clean, service oriented and friendly facilities, this is it. If you don't want to walk and want all resort amenities close together, look else where. My feeling is that you can be busy or relax anywhere in the complex. I don't see any reason to complain. We had visited several on site restaurants and weren't disappointed. The only negative that I can add is prepare ahead for the last of any food or bar options in the complex close up by 10:00pm even on the weekend. ", " We origionaly booked a room in the ocean tower, however they were setting up bleachers right below to film \"Wheel of Fortune\" so we were upgraded to the Lagoon tower. We had no idea how much we would enjoy watching the trainers work with the dolphins all day. We could hear the dolphin's sounds and watch them play with all kinds of toys. It was way better than a Sea World show! Our room (6313) was directly above the 2 smaller holding areas. It was so interesting and fun, we didn't want to leave our lanai. There were several other unique things about the resort we liked. Looking for shade, there are tons of lounges under the caves at the Kona Pool, along with a fun slide and many waterfalls.It was easy to put our fins on at the lagoon because they had the lounge chairs sitting right in the water, even though the clarity wasn't great, we at least snorkeled there once, also going over the rope and under the bridge outside the lagoon.The walk to the King and Queen's shopping areas is doable (15 min.) for active people, or they have a free tram running every 20 minutes. But our favorite hike was along the coast to A Bay. About a half hour on rough gravel and lava, seeing turtles along the way. Snorkeling there wasn't great, but better than the lagoon. If you have a car, go elsewhere. One of our favorite meals on the island was at Lava Lava at the far end of A Bay. Lovely setting near the water, food was piping hot, fish and chips, kahlua pork sandwich and sweet potato fries all outstanding!! The hotel was not too busy as it is off season- so it was nice there weren't a ton of noisy kids at the pools. The whole month of Sept. they have the \"Wheel of Fortune\" going on so this will impact the Ocean Tower area. No mini golf since that is where the bleachers are. ", " The parking and the resort fee should of been mentioned on my print out. It seems as though it deviously not excluded.The person at the check in desk was not very people friendly. She was like a robot. ", " This place is HUGE! It has it's own tram and water taxi system to get you to and from your hotel tower. When we stayed here, there were families of all shapes and sizes, and couples who were spending time by themselves. We had a 5th floor room in the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Woke up every morning and sat on the balcony before we started our day. We had a single, king sized bed in the room, and the room was good sized, with a large bathroom. The room was clean and comfortable. The grounds of this property are immaculate. While technically located on the beach, they do not have a beach on the property. However, there is a beach called A-Bay that is less than a mile away, and it's a good beach for swimming and for families with small children, as the water is relatively calm. They do have a lagoon on the property that you can swim and snorkel in, and the lagoon is fed by the ocean, and it is filled with all types of coral and wildlife, including a sea turtle. They also have a couple of dolphin pools where you can see the dolphins swim, and if you pay about $250, you can swim with them. Lots of pools, including an adults only pool in the Ocean Tower. There's a pricey, but good restaurant on the property called KPC-all the tables are outside with good views of the ocean. Do not eat at the Big Island Breakfast. It's a breakfast buffet that's way overpriced, even for Hawaii; it was over $70 for the two of us. The resort is located in Waikoloa, close to two outdoor malls that have all sorts of shops and a couple of restaurants in them as well. There are also a couple of golf courses on the property. Kona is about a 20 mile drive south.All in all we had a great time, and we would definitely recommend this resort to anyone who was planning a trip to Hawaii. ", " We spent a week at the Waikoloa for our 25th anniversary. We had our 3 teenage daughters with us. We had two ocean facing rooms in the Ocean Tower of the resort - so space was not an issue. View from each room was nice and due to the building design each room had a very unique view. We enjoyed the amenities of the resort (pools, dolphin quest, lagoon) and the dining choices. The size of the resort can be an issue - it was long from one side to another - but to us and the way we vacation we enjoyed the size and made the walking/monorailing/boating part of the experience. Although it was far if you forgot something in the car and just remembered about it when you were almost to the room!! Waikoloa is a great location to get to anywhere on the big island. We literally traveled to each corner of the island on one day or another. Shopping and food choices are nearby (Kings and Queens shopping areas) and other options are within a 15 min drive. ", " We stayed here for 3 nights 4 days with a family of 4. The accommodations are wonderful we had the ground floor opening to the dolphins with two lounge chairs. The rooms are large and spacious. The bathroom was big enough to accommodate us all with the separate sinks and shower tub areas. The pools are beautiful with waterfalls and slides we were in there for hours. The boat ride or trams help you to get around from area to area easily because the property is so large. We did not want to leave we had so much fun ", " We experienced a wonderful family vacation celebrating our 50 the wedding anniversary with our children, their spouses, and our grandchildren. This is a great property, and has a wide variety of areas for activity, or just lounging. One of the highlights for our grandchildren was the Dolphin experience. There are several different areas for safe swimming and snorkeling. The grounds are extremely well maintained and the staff was friendly and helpful. We rented three condos in the Hilton Kingslad Vacation Club area - one for each family. Each two bedroom condo was well equipped, very nicely decorated, very comfortable beds and were located convenient to all the activities. ", " The tennis clinic and instructors at the Hilton are great. Attended several clinics and was very impressed. The director of tennis and fitness, Liane Depontes, is one of the best instructors i've ever had. She is energetic, always positive and knows how to teach. The staff is very helpful and they make for a great addition to this wonderful Waikoloa location. You do not need to stay at the Hilton to use the tennis facility. For a fee, of course, you can set up private or semi-private lessons or get to use a court. Liane will make it happen for you. ", " Staff very friendly and extremely knowledgeable and helpful about island activities, which tours are best suited to the type of adventure you desire, etc. Food is not cheap but is top quality at all venues. Housekeeping efficient and thorough - room made up rapidly, spotless, etc. Huge place with plenty to do right at the resort - you could spend your week right there but then you would miss the rest of the island! We slept great with the balcony door open - the AC shuts down automatically when the door is opened, and the evening temperatures were good for sleeping. ", " I would not hesitate to book another trip to the Hilton Waikoloa. Everything about this resort is amazing!! I have been there two other times and would go back again. The pools are GREAT and the young people who are employed to service the guests around the pool areas are very sweet people. We stayed in the newly renovated Lagoon Tower rooms and were very happy with our accommodations. ", " I stayed here with my company and enjoyed a few extra days with my family. I did the dolphin swim, my son did the scuba training, and my mom enjoyed the sea turtles. The food is not cheap, but after spending a week in Waikiki, I realized that in HI. I specifically knew I planned to spend money to enjoy my time in Waikoloa. There is a bus that takes you to the city center, but the food is limited and again expensive. I loved the ocean view that I woke up to everyday and loved the three swimming pools including the one that is fed by the ocean with sea life. I did the kayaking and laid out and enjoy the beach. Save up for Hawaii and you will be glad you did. This is not a cheap hotel, but the amenities are great and I did not care about the price with how much fun three generations of my family had. Once in a life time enjoyment. Staff was great! ", " This hotel takes resort expectations and throws them out the window!The room is nice but you will probably be too busy exploring the incredible resort grounds to notice .The staff is friendly but the grounds are huge so you might sometimes feel like you're the only guest at the resort (trust me it's an amazing feeling)Oh and check out the island too! ", " We stayed at HWV for 2 night.Hotel is huge - divided into 3 towers and all towers are connected with train which is operated by hotel and a boat is also available.While we were there hotel was not so busy as it was end of busy holiday season.We stayed in Palace tower and had a good access to hotel pool and lagoon and restaurant as it's located in center of hotelLocation - the whole Island is divided in small parts and the Waikaloa village is a posh area where you see similar type hotels, condos and residences and time shares. We took speedy shuttle from airport which was comfortable as quick took us 30 mins to reach hotel smooth ride. Very close to hotel is kings and queens market which is a good place to get the groceries and food items, plus some shopping also.- rooms - room we got was ocean facing and was spacious - again cleaning was not very good could see dust around the room, but was comfortable and staff was helpful.Play station was a good add on as you can get free DVD from lobby - there are lot of DVD rental machines in lobby of each tower. I liked it as for extended stays this can be a great benefit - movies were available in different languages plus games were also available.Sound proofing in rooms are ok, no major challengers for us.We tried 2 restaurants - Tonys pizza place. Very good pasta and awesome pizza with open air outside dinning - a great setting. Price was reasonable .Last night tried KPC - great good, awesome ambience open air on the ocean and good breeze, very delicious food and service was friendly and very well trained staff.We tried 2 pools but we liked the ocean tower pool as it had slides and was not so busy. There is actually no beach in the hotel - you have to go outside and walk a few minutes - actually Marriott have a good beach.Have lots of activities for kids and extended stays.We had a great time. ", " September after kids are gone back to school is time to make a great vacation here. Pool is great. Walking around this huge complex is a picture to be taken every turn. Rent a car and explore Waimea and other local restruants for great food. Love this place and the Big Island in all. ", " Every team member that we had the pleasure of meeting was very courteous and helpful. We were congratulated numerous times for being there on our honeymoon. The team members remembered us and went out of their way to make us feel at home. Michelle with the tours and activities was especially helpful and Kaitlyn that did the orientation made sure we got the most out of our vacation. We went snorkeling and charter fishing on her recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased. We were sad to leave, but we will be back again one day. Thank you all for delivering the value that we have come to expect from a Hilton property. Aloha ", " The grounds were immaculate. The room was showing some age and use, but didn't bother me. The employees were always nice. I'd stay again.This is a family place. We spoke with locals who said thy do stay-cations here with their kids. Great pools. It is really spread out. Just allow 15 extra minutes to go anywhere, including the car.Our kids saw us on the hotel web-cams back home...Checkout was packed. They had 8 counter people so the wait wasn't long. We thought all the fake \"art\" in their \"collection\" was kind of funny (art by the pound from China), over the top. But with the spectacular scenic views at every angle, who cares. Incredible views. ", " My husband and I just left Kona today heading home, it was our very first visit to the Big Island. This was our very first stay at a Hilton hotel so it was kind of a big deal for us. I read up the place before we went and nothing quite compared me for it once we arrived. It was awesome! Just like the reviews that I had read, the place is HUGE. We stayed in the Palace Tower, which I highly recommend because it sits pretty much in the middle of everything. I had read several negative reviews about the place being too Disney Land-ish...umm, I didn't see anything that would even remotely lead me to think of Disney Land. It was nothing more than the perfect place to stay for a vacation. My husband and I loved taking the monorail to and from our tower to the main building. We took the boat to our room once, it was cool but we liked the monorail better. Everyone was really nice, very accommodating and professional. The property was kept in tip top shape...it was gorgeous. We rented a car and opted to park in the general parking lot where you're charged $17/day. We could've paid the $5 extra/day for valet but the walk down to the main parking lot and back was great exercise that we didn't mind getting AND it's not even far. It's an overall fabulous experience and we would definitely recommend Hilton Waikoloa to our friends and family. ", " This hotel is a great destination for families. Between the train, the boat, the dolphins and the children's beach, my 2 and a half year old son was thrilled. And that made our stay great. We booked through Coscto which includes buffet breakfasts, the luau, an upgrade to ocean view and a rental car. Definitely recommend this offer for a great value. Also, this part of island is beautiful, even when the other parts are rainy. We will definitely go back. ", " We stayed here for three nights to round out a three week trip to Hawaii. We loved it. There was so much to do on the resort with the kids. They loved the pools, waterfalls, slides, mini golf, etc. You get free PS2, games and DVD included in your booking. Rooms are reasonably spacious compared to other hotel rooms. We found the staff would go out of their way to help us. We stayed in the Palace tower with golf course views - we simply could not afford the double the price ocean views of other areas. Did we mind, no. Yes, it is a bit expensive and things such as mini golf and other sports could have been cheaper.Why do you get charged for parking? Yes, the monorail and boats can get tiresome if you just want to go for a swim etc. But overall, we had a great time and could have stayed another three days. The hotel is a bit isolated from Kona but you have the Waikoloa village nearby. A warning, with so much to do, it is difficult getting out and seeing the rest of the island. ", " All the accommodation where right there in one spot and Crystal Botelho the manager of the lagoon made great suggestions on what to try and do and everything was easy and we had a blast.All pool area's and the lagoon where clean and well kept & managed. ", " The locals nickname can be supported by the tram that takes guests from the lobby to the 3 separate hotel buildings and restaurants. It takes 10-15 minutes by tram or by walking to get from the Ocean Tower to the Lobby. The food at the restaurants that we ate at on site had menus with a wide variety of choice and the food was very good, but the prices outrageous. Luckily, we discovered the Queen's Shops and King's Shops (2 shopping centers across the street from each other) down the street with less expensive but good food; at Queen's there was a food court and a small grocery store (sort of a like a mini-Target). By the way, parking at the resort is also quite expensive. I really think this resort is more oriented toward families with pre-teen children or those who don't have a car and want everything in walking distance. There was an adult pool at the Ocean Tower, which was very nice; thank you Hilton for thinking of adults without children! It was great to go into the pool just before sunset and listen to all the birds in the trees. This Hilton is located in the hottest and driest part of the big island; if you get too hot, go for a drive elsewhere, however, if you have gone elsewhere, it is always nice to return to a warm sunny Waikaloa! Other than the expensive restaurants, the only other real downside were the tiny beds...they must have been full size beds because they were much too small to be queen size; I really wish they had been king size beds since that's what I sleep in at home and there were 4 of us staying in that 2 bed hotel room. ", " Wow, this was just simply beautiful . I love dolphins and we got a room the viewed them as well as the beach. We took the boat a couple times as well as the monorail. The place is HUGE!!! I hope we can come here again and bring our daughters. ", " Very disappointed in the original rate quote and come to find out it was a much higher rate which started me off on the wrong foot and a bad feeling in my heart. We ordered room service for the kids one night and the food did not arrive for an hour or more and one of the kids fell asleep without any dinner, ", " This was my fourth visit to Hilton Waikola. My first visit was over 20 years ago but the place still looks just the same. They have kept it up very well. Excellent ammentities. Multiple pools with slides. Good for families, friends, romance. Swim with the Dolphins program. Really enjoyed it. ", " The resort is so huge that it provides tram and boat for internal transportation. It has several pools with slides and falls at various size. There are parrots, turtles and even dophins in the resorts! 2 big shopping centers are nearby. Our family stayed there for 3 nights and we had a forgetable experience there. Room facility is modest, but clean and comfortable for stay. ", " A beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing retreat.It was such a large area that we never felt crowded and were free to stroll along the shore and hotel grounds at our leisure. Watched the whales and sunrise over the ocean from our lanai . Beautiful ", " I was very happy with the accomodations, staff, cleanliness, and amenities. We had an oceanview room in the lagoon tower, which was fabulous. The view can't be beat. It was an easy walk to the lobby, pool, and parking lot, so we didn't have to wait for the tram. I could see how that could get old. The restaurants are WAY expensive, so if you have a car, I recommend going out to eat. The golf course restaurant had a decent breakfast and lunch menu, and Starbucks at the Queens shops is about half the cost of Waikoloa Coffee. If you have a car, or would like a little exercise, both are not far from the hotel, about a 20 minute walk. ", " My husband and I spent 3 days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in June 2010. It was one of the most memorable and romantic getaways we have ever had. The resort is a destination in itself with a private lagoon, dolphin swimming and a lightrail that takes you anywhere on the resort. Highly recommend this hotel for a girlfriends weekend away, to a honeymoon, or family vacation. ", " We loved this property. The lagoon with the fish and the green turtles was the highlight. The pools were nice. The restaurants were quiet pricy and not that great. Breakfast was very good. If you are planning to spend a lot of time at the resort get the 10% card that the sell.The ice cream place was good. The rooms were OK a little cramped. We booked a multi-island package through Costco so breakfast for the adults and the resort fee was included. Parking was expensive. They have dolphin encounter too for an extra fee. The rooms had free wifi. ", " Our trip to Kona and our stay at Waikoloa Village was the perfect vacation. We spent a week in a suite that overlooked a lagoon that we swam in daily with sea turtles. Sunsets were something you only could dream of and we sat in hammocks every evening to see them. The pool was big and the kids loved the water slide. The room was very clean. The restaurants onsite were expensive but that is everywhere in Hawaii. There is a grocery store not even half a mile up the street . I can't wait for the family to go back and have the most relaxing time again. ", " Seriously two of the coolest dudes I've ever met at a Hotel in Hawaii!! Brian is super friendly and generous; he makes a mean Virgin Pi\u00f1a Colado and Chocolate Smoothie for te kiddos and a kickass Lava Flow w floater for the adults. When my 5 year old dumped his smoothie in the sand before even sip one, and he returned to Brian with his empty, pebble-strewn cup, Brian said \"You don't even have to ask! I got it\" Stellar dude! Brandon was fun and friendly, giving all kinda of good tip on how to et maximum speed and full velocity on the big slide.Highly recommend this hotelAnd their amazing staff! Hilton Waikoloa is the bee's knees!! ", " It's a perfect place for families and couples. You have to spend at least a couple of days on this resort to enjoy all the fun stuff.It's well maintained and excellent service from all aspects of their day to day operations.Tips:Makai rooms are worth the upgrade. Other parts of the property is just as good, just a little more time is spent to get to the lobby. But not a deal breaker, their is a tram and the walk is not bad.Enjoy the breakfast at the restaurant once, but the coffee shops are a better option.We tried all the restaurants and all of them are great, sunset dinner is a must.Thanks Debi for an excellent team, stay was overall a great experience. We are planning for a return trip in 2016. ", " I stayed her for a night with my family ( parents, sister, niece, nephew & family friend) during a trip to the big island. The rooms are standard resort hotel rooms. Nice, clean, nice toiletries.This resort is Huge! They have a tram and a both ( both are kinda slow) it has several pools, including a lazy river, kiddie pool and adult pool, a lagoon and a couple of water slides!It is a great place for families with children.We received amazing service during our stay! We had a small problem that the staff was able to help us with and resolve, ensuring our stay was wonderful. Kelly and Charlie were amazing! ", " Overall a great stay! Brandon from the pool gave us helpful tips to go faster on the slides, just a really cool guy. The staff was very helpful in the directions, rooms were nice and clean. The pools were amazing they have three or four pools for the you gets kids and for the adults there's a huge water slide. Great weekend!!!! ", " Loved the hotel but the internet fee of $25.00 per day is pretty costly.The grounds were very maintained and the decorations were exquisite.The flowers in the lobby were real as were the parrots. I think it would be nice if a continental breakfast were included with the room fee. ", " We came here as part of our honeymoon and we stayed in the Ocean Tower. The hotel itself is very impressive and you can see great sunsets from several places on the property. The lobby has several parrots/tropical birds on stands that make for an interesting (and fun) experience just sitting in the lobby. The resort is massive, so there is a tram to travel around. (There was also a gondola service if you're feeling more extravagant/ludicrous, but it doesn't run the full day.) We stayed in the Ocean Tower, which is the farthest away from the front desk and the parking lot. It was probably a 40 minute walk from our room to self parking if you missed the tram; the walk is made more interesting by the route being through their art collection. The room itself was very nice, spacious and comfortable, and our ocean view was as beautiful as we expected. We had the Big Island Breakfast every morning as a part of our hotel package and we found it to be very good. There were tons of options and you could eat enough in the morning to last you most of the day. We also went to the Boat Landing Cantina at the base of the Ocean Tower and thought it was a tasty option with good service that wasn't too expensive. Many of the on-site dining options get very pricy, so be aware that there are many more reasonably-priced choices a few blocks down the road at the Kings' Shops and Queens' Marketplace - we quite enjoyed Ippy's Hawaiian BBQ, but there were plenty of other possibilities around as well.One good thing to know is that there are feral cats all around this property (a problem throughout Hawaii, not really any fault of this Hilton). They didn't cause any problems, but one of our waitresses told us they came around some of the outdoor eating areas in the evenings, which could be bad if you have allergies. The hotel had a very nice, large pool with beautiful landscaping. It wasn't as lavishly complex as some resort pools, but it had a very nice waterfall and bridges crossing the pool. It did seem like a great place for kids; the hotel rented inflatable floats for kids (ride a killer whale!), and there was a separate section of the pool for very little kids (with an artificial beach that leads into the pool). We went to the pool early in the morning, so it wasn't crowded, but we could see it getting very full of kids and families later in the day. Overall, a very nice place to stay, with lots of activities, food options, and a friendly staff. We'll likely stay here again when we're back on the Big Island! ", " This hotel is the resort experience. Family friendly and romantic, it is a breathtaking hotel complex. The rooms are lovely and spacious (with an empty fridge to fill up with snacks or beverages; we chose to fill ours with poke and champagne). The views are tremendous. Everywhere you look it is beautiful, from the art filled walkways to the ocean lagoon filled with sea life. During our stay, the waters around the island were a bit choppy so having the lagoon with sea turtles and tropical fish meant we still got to snorkel and be active. The large pool complex is fantastic, with waterfalls, a slide, lava hot tubs, and a bar with the tropical blended drinks you envision on holiday. There is a little boat that takes you from the front desk to your hotel or the pool and spa. We stayed in the Palace Tower and loved it. Little recommendations while you stay here:Do the valet: for five dollars more you get a crack staff of valets who know how to get it started to cool down before you even get in. They have great advice. You can ask them for help getting to A bay around the corner for a bit more diverse fish for your snorkel.Restaurants are expensive, but you are paying for the views: You probably can't eat on site for less that 25 a person for food that ranges from normal to delicious. However, if having a burger next to dolphins doing flips and black tip reef sharks doesn't add value to what you are doing, I think the value system needs a bit of a reshuffle. I would plan to bring some food to your room, but don't miss out on enjoying yourself on site. Staff are great: We got help with anything we wanted to know. People were very friendly.Walk the path: The art at the resort is phenomenal. Drums from Papua New Guinea. Balinese statues. There is a tour about the art. Do the activities.Sunset on site: Walk to the far end of the resort beyond the Ocean Tower and find the massive Buddha sculpture, watch sunset from here. Thank you Hilton Waikoloa! This resort is part of the reason I like the Big Island best. Aloha! ", " Our vacation started on the Hilo side of Island, where we rented a house. Then Hurricane Iselle hit and we were left with no power or water. After two days and no end in sight we packed up and headed for the west side of island. Hilton Waikoloa is a beautiful resort with something for everyone. The suite in Palace Tower was wonderful, although the sofa bed was very uncomfortable and my son ended up sleeping on the unopened sofa instead. Service here was very good, the lagoon is great for all water sports and rentals, and 3 pools from water slides to adults only make it perfect for those with kids or without. Restaurants are below par though, so head out of hotel and into the \"village\" portion of the resort where you will find a shopping plaza and a restaurant/marketplace open air mall. Better variety of food there and lower prices. Location was perfect for seeing things on both sides of the island. Highly recommend this hotel. ", " I stayed here from 8/12/14 through 8/19/14 in the Ocean tower. The room 4042 was clean and comfortable with a ocean and golf course view. The boat ride to the room docks at the Boat Cantina restaurant in the center of Ocean tower. My kids loved the ride on the boats and tram to our room. The resort is very large so getting around on them helps little kids at the end of the day when swimming in all the pools. There is so much to do at the resort that its hard to leave the grounds. The resort is absolutely beautiful. The only downside, if any is the price of the restaurants. We ate at the Island market in the Queen shops to keep the cost down a little. I would definitely go back to this place again. Enjoy Stephen. ", " My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa for our 5 year wedding anniversary. The resort has all the amenities you could ask for. Our 2 year old daughter enjoyed the pools, the trams, and the dolphins. We had a great time. ", " This place is fantastic, you don't get that impression from reviews, but it is very large, it has great pools, great lagoon, beautiful parks and the halls are fantastic (they all have superb decoration, almost looks like a museum). Great views of the ocean from anywhere in the hotel. We got an ocean view room, and it was fantastic (ocean tower). People in the hotel overall are nice but the \"Service\" per se is terrible. From check in they tried for about 10 minutes to convince me to upgrade to another room (seriously was like being at the car rental in LA when they try you to get an insurance) , when I politely said no 50 times, the woman (Frida) rudely said \"so you just want to keep your room???\" (again this was a deluxe full ocean view, pretty nice room), then she went on to try to sell me some discount card, to what I said no. When we later inquired about the Luau (to somebody else) we were told how the regular rate sucks and we should get an \"upgrade level\" to a better seating spot etc, we ended up not doing the luau. It was sad, because it gives the impression that their base services are bad, and they are not (of course they are working on commission). So, I would stay there, but not talk to anybody and try to avoid their services. btw, we ate at the pizza place and it was quite good. ", " I have never seen anything like this resort. It is like staying at sea world with flamingos, parrots, dolphins, sharks, turtles etc. Complete with a train to get from one side of the resort to the other. Several restaurants and walkways resembling a museum. A man made lagoon and several pools. We stayed in the ocean tower and had no problem with noisy birds as some have described. It is a unique and showy resort which was a lot of fun to explore. ", " Fifteen years ago my husband and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and this summer we brought our children, a long journey from the East Coast! Again, we were in awe. Beautiful resort and amazing accommodations.You should know that this resort is HUGE! The journey from the lobby to your room is going to be at least 15 minutes...walking, by tram or by boat. Our room was wonderful with a huge luggage room, perfect for those of us with enough belongings for two weeks! We arrived on the day Hurricane Iselle was set to hit the big Island. The hotel was prepared, delivering flashlights to each room, appointing staff identified with specific t-shirts throughout the resort with up to date info, and updating guests by phone, letter and on the TV. They prepared for the worst! These preparations did include closing up all shops, most restaurants and even the pools well in advance of the storm...which actually never hit our side of the island---so the lack of things to do was a bit disappointing. They set up a make shift dining area in a convention room and for $29.95 pp you could eat a buffet dinner which we would best describe as fair...but they tried. Our room was cleaned very early each day and the shampoo, soap, etc. were outstanding! Self Parking is not included but is very convenient to the resort's main entrance. This resort is a perfect example of what is the big island...lava, beautiful flora and much aloha! Can't wait to go back. Hopefully in less than 15 years this time!!One last note---my daughter (10 years old) did a Dolphin Encounter at the Dolphin Quest location on site...it was amazing!! ", " It was a wonderful treat to be and stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. This was our 2nd stay here, the last about 5 years ago, and we enjoyed every minute. Our room was on the top floor in the Ocean Towers with a garden view. We were certainly pleasantly surprised during the busy summer months to obtain this great room with a nice view. We booked the cheapest room they offerred just knowing it would be fun just being there and not being concerned about where our room was. What a wonderful treat to have it on the top floor Ocean Tower. We did not have any ocean view but we did have a nice view of the gardens and property. Though the room location was close to the elevator (1st room next to it) we never heard it at all. In fact, it was extremely quiet in and around our room area the entire stay. The rooms are large, plenty of space for 2 people, and do have small refrigerators which was a blessing. We spent most of our day time at the lagoon sunning and snorkeling. There are plenty of \"beach toys\" to rent an enjoy. We did not go to any of the other pools. As far as the restaraunts, they are pricey. Even more so than you would expect. If you can live off sandwiches and cold foods, it will save on food expense. The parking fee is $17 per day for self park. All in all, we really did enjoy ourselves and we would definitely stay again. ", " Great resort for resort holiday. There are some very nice touches that really make this sort of thing. The lagoon is great and provides a fantastic opportunity to swim with turtles. They were everywhere. Even by the pool there is sufficient amount of seating so that you are not wandering looking for a chair. Food was pretty good and we didn't really have a bad meal. Staff were always very friendly and went out of our way to help, even when we had a small crisis which says a lot about the people there. It is a resort so be prepared to pay. ", " Best Hawaiian trip ever! This place is huge with dolphins, sharks, turtles, private lagoons, and pools with slides. Costco travel was great as the package included air, car, daily breakfast buffet, luau, and resort fee. They beat out Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Our server, Sheryl greeted us every morning by name and remembered our drink orders. Our OJ and coffee was brought without our asking. Jairus and Stephen, the servers' helpers were always attending us also! The breakfast hostesses were also greeting us by name every morning. The hotel resort is huge with a tram and boat service to your room tower. It takes about 20 mins to the lobby, so don't forget anything. Otherwise it can be a long round trip. My only complaint is that there is hardly any fish in their natural lagoon. If they can house dolphins / turtles / sharks... Why not more Hawaiian fish like humuhumu, yellow tangs, and moorish idols? This way we can safely snorkel there with the kids instead of paying $$$ to go out on a boat. ", " The hotel is anything but ordinary. First, it is huge and it is especially well located. The open sea lagoon gives you the opportunity to swim with sea turtles who come. Our room overlooked the pool with dolphins. Brilliant! The dozens of statues, Chinese vases and other artifacts that decorate the site is worthy of a museum. I would go back anytime. ", " We stayed here for a week with our two kids. Hands down, this was one of the best vacations of our lives. The grounds are immaculate and immense. You can choose between multiple pools, swimming with the dolphins (for an additional charge), the ocean, or the lagoon. They were all wonderful, but the lagoon was our favorite. Our kids enjoyed snorkeling under the waterfall and watching the large turtle and other fish.There are multiple high quality restaurants on site with anything you or your family could want.We hired a photographer from the hotel who spent over an hour photographing us throughout the beautiful grounds which was one of the greatest values of our entire trip. ", " My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa with family members who were visiting from the Mainland. We love coming to the Hilton Waikoloa anyway but it especially felt like a vacation for us even with our large group. The views and grounds are incredible, the rooms are super comfortable and quiet, and it was an excellent experience for all nine of the people in our group. ", " Hilton Waikoloa is beautiful. It has the ocean and its man made lagoon. The resort is huge but has a tram or a boat to take you to one end to the other. Its clean well maintained and the room in the Lagoon tower was beautiful. The restaurants inside HWV were convenient and delicious. It does not have beach access but there are plenty of beaches nearby that you can drive too if you prefer the sand. Wonderful wonderful place in Hawaii. ", " Debi Bishop is extremely nice and very welcoming. Crystal Bach and Andrew Hoffman are in my opinion the two best people that work in the Guest Transportation department. Crystal and Andrew always do more than they need or are required to do. They are both very welcoming. They take pride in what they do. They are EXCELLENT EMPLOYEES. Stayed in the Makai room and was nice. We were there during Hurricane Iselle and we were well taken care of and we felt very safe. We were provided with a flash light, updated at least once a day of what the hotel was going to do via TV, Twitter, Facebook, and paper handouts. Extra bottles of water were placed in our room in case we had to stay in the room for a long period of time. We had a great time and can't wait to go back a visit again! ", " This was our first trip to Kona and to this hotel, before we got there we were skeptical due to some bad reviews, but we decided to experience it and make our own opinion... Not a bit of negativenes! Everything was great, location, accomodations, staff, what a pleasure experience!!! I felt like being in Paradise...love it love it love it! and would love to come back. Huge piece of land, so there is a lot of walking to do around, bring comfortable shoes. There are birds everywhere but they didnt bother me because my room was facing the golf ourse, anyways I loved hearring the birds because it gave me the feeling of being in an Island. The luau's are not every night so you need to plan accordingly or attend the Luau's at any of the other hotels nearby. Great experience, great hotel. ", " I love Waikoloa !! If u check out spa services, try Tonia she was amazing and it was definitely one of my favorite spa experiences to date !!! I always have the most fun at Waikoloa due to its location and spacious facilities !! Escaping the city life and experiencing inner peace and outer beauty is what makes this an annual destination. Have some Longboard drafts, kiss the Buddha, & watch some amazing sunsets on the big island. I'm Waikoloa's biggest fan !!! ", " My husband, son and I were here for only four nights of our eleven in the state of Hawaii. We are Hilton Diamond members and were treated wonderfully (0nly one bad minor incident, which was handled very well). The place is beautiful -we stayed at the Lagoon Tower and our view of the ocean, lagoon and dolphin tanks were awesome. I hated to leave the hotel each day for our \"outings\". In fact, one night I stayed while my husband and son when on a boat and snorkeling outing. Fabulous pools, the lagoon is full of fish and sea turtles, the dolphins are always active. The evening Hilton Honors Desk Manager was wonderful-we had a problem with the concierge not being friendly concerning booking a Luau for us. The HH evening manager apologized and gave us a 50 dollar credit. Our air conditioner wasn't working properly-the same manager had someone up to fix it very quickly. Even when I made a mistake (and called to apologize) about our room not being clean (it was, my son went back in and messed it up while we were out)-he was wonderful and sent someone up with extra towels and shampoo! Great hotel, every one friendly (the concierge staff with the exception of one man were extremely helpful and friendly). As a diamond member, they gave us 80 dollars in credit for food, we didn't pay the resort fee and only paid for our parking! We were upgraded to a great room and allowed to enter at 10:am in the morning (instead of the usual check in time, since we arrived early). My husband and son loved the spa (which, we were allowed to use for free-diamond status!). This place was so beautiful I could not stop taking pictures. All and all I wish we would have just spent our entire 11 days here! This place is beyond believable -it is now my favorite hotel. I can't wait to come back!! ", " Most Hilton properties in US is not as good as the ones overseas, but definitely not this one! This is probably the best Hilton stay for me so far! Spacious rooms, quite a few restaurants and bars, transportation from lobby via tram or boat! What great experience! Definitely would recommend anyone who is going to Waikoloa Village to stay in this property! ", " We love coming back to the Wiakoloa Village. It feels like home and everyone shows the Hawaiian Spirit at every turn. We were not supposed to be in Waikiki on our way home from the Big Island, but hurricane Iselle had a different plan. Great hotel complex, everything is first class. . We ended up having to cut our visit short and head to Waikiki two days early. The staff at the HGV hotels were great, they looked after us and kept us updated as the hurricane approached. The folks at Wiakloa Village, Kings Landing allowed us to stay in our unit until our departure time. Hilton Grand Vacations group is definitely is the top of the tops for timeshares. Thanks again. ", " I always stay at this Hilton when I visit the Big Island of Hawaii. No matter if I go for business, or as a vacation get-away, I always stay at this Hilton. The staff is friendly and very professional. The shops, fitness center, and restaurants are all five-star in my opinion. So, no matter if your going for business or pleasure, I highly recommend this Hilton if you are going to visit the Big Island of Hawaii. ", " Very nice and comfy hotel. Central with shops and restaurants that are convenient and close by. Roy's restaurant for excellent dining, There's a decent market close by as well. Excellent place to stay on the Kona side of the big island. ", " What an awesome, enormous, beautiful, resort. I had a great time swimming in the lagoon with the turtles and tropical fish. Available for use are paddle boards, canoes, wake boards, and bicycle paddles.Three enormous separate hotels with near sound proof rooms. Beautiful views of lush tropical plant life. I took pictures of just about every statue, art work and painting along the open air hall way that leads from one hotel to the other. Very interesting sections along the open air hallway having painting, statues and art work that cover different countries like Japan, India, China and of course legends of Hawaii. About a half mile walk from the Ocean View towers past the Palace Tower to the Lagoon Tower Hotels and roughly a 3 mile hike around the entire site past the luau out door complex, 2 huge swimming pools, Dolphin Quest Village, a water fall, the lagoon, Buddha Point, to the main lobby and the Grand Stair Case. The trams and boat rides will get you to the 3 hotels. On my honeymoon in October 1971 the Kona coast was nothing but lava and now parts of the coast have been transformed into a tropical paradise. A place for singles,newly weds, families and friends. I'd recommend the Hilton, Waikoloa, Kona, Hawaii, the Big Island to everyone!!! AWESOME place for a tropical vacation in paradise. I hope to return for more vacations at the Hilton Waikoloa, Kona, Hawaii. ", " Our stay at the Hilton was booked through Costco as part of a package; airfare, hotel and rental car. Our room at the Hilton was clean, large and modern. The property was well maintained and beautifully landscaped. Staff were professional and friendly and all the extra amenities offered by the resort came in very handy; shops, restaurants and access to onsite and offsite activities. One of our favorite activities was the luau. We had a great time but agree everything was very expensive, or involved an extra fee which forced us to burn through our budget faster than we had planned. I guess if you are budget conscious, you shouldn't stay at this resort. ", " Waikoloa is a beautiful property, but our check-in experience was horrible. We waited in the check in line for about 20 minutes when a gentleman came up to us and offered to help us. While proceeding to check us in he seem to have some difficulty with room assignments and left to check on a room, thus another wait for 15 minutes. When he finally returned he said the room was not ready, the maid is still in the room cleaning. We were given the room keys and check in envelope containing the parking lot exit key. We were told to wait for a cell phone call, then call the four digit number he gave us for the room assignment. We were told we are assigned to the Palace Tower, so we took the tram to the Palace Tower and waited in the lobby. One hour later no call, so I called the four digit number and inquired about our room. A girl from the front desk answered and said we must continue to wait for the call. Half an hour later still no call, so I called the number again to inquire about our room. A girl answered and said we were not suppose to be at the Palace Tower and that we should go to the Ocean Tower and see the Concierge for our room. We had a wedding to attend at 5 0'clock and it was 4:30pm. We lost a lot of time waiting, wrong building assignment and no phone call. Finally after reaching the Ocean Tower, we received new keys to our room and barely made it to the Wedding. If I did not call back to keep inquiring about our room, we would have missed the wedding altogether. This is a nice property, but chaotic at check in. The parking key did not work, so I could not leave the parking lot until some one came to assist. With the lobby a good hike away, it was not fun trying to get assistance. ", " We can't wait to return to this hotel. I loved all of the birds that flew into the hotel every evening and left every morning. Once they got settled in, the noise wasn't so bad. (Palace Towers) You must drive down the street to Hapuna Beach. Explore the left side of the beach, you won't be disappointed. ", " We usually don't make a habit of returning to a hotel year after year. The Hilton Waikoloa Village has become an exception to our general rule. The property is large, with a small boat and tram system to facilitate getting around. Even in high season, you do not feel crowded there. It is a stunning setting, with plenty to do on site. Minature golf, tennis, golf, all water sports in the inlet ocean lagoon, dolphin interaction experience, traditional laua, three pools, and about 10 restaurants. However, the property is centrally located on the Big island, so that day adventures are easy to accomplish, and you do not feel stuck at the property. Rent a car. The staff is knowledgable and willing to assist with room accommodations, restaurant reservations and suggestions (on or off property) and activities. There are 2 shopping centers located just about 1/4 mile walk from the hotel where you can purchase whatever you may need or may have forgotten. Its definitely a great find. ", " Incredible destination! Service impeccable with incredible amenities. Free shuttle between resorts. No need for rental car unless you plan to travel the island. Abundant wildlife and beautiful landscaping. Community grocery well stocked and not over priced. Having lived in Hawaii; I still consider it an A+ destination. ", " This resort is very nice. Beautiful grounds and friendly staff. There are lots of beautiful pools and the lagoon gets visited by lots of turtles. It is very large and you will do a great deal of walking to get anywhere but they do have the tram and boats that are a nice option if you want to get around leisurely. As others have mentioned, the restaurant prices and coffee are high. That is pretty much expected at a resort of this type. Everything on this side of the Island is expensive. The big Island is awesome with lots to do away from the hotel. I would recommend getting a rental car to explore the Hilo side of the Island where there is much more rain and very tropical. The hotel staff was very friendly and always provided great service. I did have some issues with the parking lot being full a couple nights and complained about my issues to a manager that resolved my issues above my expectations. We were there for eight nights and the resort was at full capacity a few nights. It never was crowded with the exception that the self parking did fill up and it was difficult to park a few nights. Overall it was a great vacation to the big island. We will be back again. I would highly recommend it. ", " Disregard any negative reviews of this resort. It is seriously one of the best resorts I have ever been to. Yes, it is huge. Yes, if you try and walk this 22 acre resort and you are out of shape, you won't like yourself for it. Yes, it was built in the 80's and still has some relics from that era (like gold elevators) but c'mon. It's a very nice hotel and well taken care of. Everything here is beautiful. The lagoon is prime space for safe swimming with the family, and we saw so many turtles while snorkeling here! The location is great...away from the bigger cities on the big island but there is plenty of shopping and restaurants. Food, however, is extremely expensive...but you are going to find that on just about any resort. ", " We stayed just this month for a week at Waikoloa Hilton. Family of 4, two kids 4 and 6. It was amazing!!! We love to travel and know good food. We were very pleasantly surprised by all the resort food-- excellent dinner at KPC, big island breakfast is fantastic, Italian restaraunt was great! We didn't care much for the Boat Landing Cantina, but we are from TX and love our cantina food. The Grill by the main pool was awesome!! Bacon avocado burgers were of high quality too! This resort allowed us to check out, go to the beach and come back to a courtesy room for an hour to shower and change before our flight home since we didn't leave til 11pm. I thought that was super nice of them!! They even offered to restock the towels and shampoo in this room if we needed it. Every employee we encountered was personable and accommodating! We never ever felt unwelcome. This hotel is also in a great location!!! Ten mins from Hapuna Beach and a short drive to the Waipio Valley! The Kohala Coast is beautiful and yes there is lava rock, but there is also fluffy white sand beaches! Way less populated than Oahu. If you want a low-key and family friendly tropical paradise, the Big Island is the place for you!! Waikoloa Village also had plenty of hidden hot tubs and romantic spots for couples. Kids are there but we never saw them acting crazy or being annoying. Everyone had a great time!!! Would highly recommend this hotel. Rooms were nice too. It is big so if you have small kids, ask for a room at the Lagoon Tower. It's closest to the main lobby and best pools! Contrary to some other posts prices weren't that bad--it's a hotel in Hawaii!! And children 4 and under eat free at all restaraunts. Dolphin Quest was majorly expensive so we didn't do that and the kids didn't care. Rent a car and see the rest of the Island too!!! It is spectacular!!! We did Sunshine Helicopter volcano Delux tour and saw breathtaking waterfalls and lava. Gorgeous!!! Have fun!! ", " This is a great property from top to bottom. My family and I stayed here two years ago, and we couldn't wait to come back. This trip not only lived up to our first experience but exceeded it. We stayed in the Makai rooms which are there most recently upgraded accomodations. I strongly recommend these if you want the best experience. They are all ocean views and are right next to the main pool. The staff were extreemly friendly. Both concierges I worked with were outstanding, the bell staff was very friendly and welcoming, and the front desk set the tone with exceptional service by making me aware of all of the benefits I could take advantage of. The resturants on property are great (and I regulary eat at some great resturants throughout the United States, not chain locations). The Provision Company is one of my favorites. I planned on eating there once, but went twice. The same for Imari, great sushi and overall experience. Finally, for the family the Pizza at the Italian Resturant below Kirin has some of the best pizza I've had (who would of thought Spam and Pinapple could be so good). Speaking of Kirin, I had to roll myself back to the room after a great Dim Sum lunch. For those of you who stay at Hiltons on a regular basis, there is no executive lounge, but they make up for it by offering vouchers which for us equalled roughly $200 ($20 per day for 10 days). This property is perfect for family vacations. I can't wait to return. ", " We were picked up by Jun's Taxi, a taxi service that we reserved to pick me up upon my arrival at the Kona Airport. Very nice guy, he told us about the Big Island, as it was me and my families first time to Hawaii. I asked Jun about the beaches, our hotel, food places. He assured us that we were going to love our hotel, to make sure we had local food (poki, spam musabi, Kailua Pig), and told us about the local beaches.Upon being dropped of at the Hilton, we were already overwelmed by the entry into our hotel.... nice trees everywhere... friendly valet and bell staff who immediatey approached us, grabbed out bags. As we walked into the hotel, i immediately noticed the grand staircase. BEAUTIFUL!!! Right near the little pond where people were stand up paddling and kayaking. I also noticed the tram that takes you all around the hotel, as well as little boats!When we got out room keys, we had a nice ocean view. I could not believe what a beautiful view we had!! We immediately dropped our things off and went to the beach.The one thing i LOVE about the hilton is the STAFF. thats what makes it even more beautiful. Everyone is sooooo nice.After the beach, we grabbed some breakfast at the waters edge buffet. BEAUTIFUL restaurant, tall windows looking out to the ocean. Our servers name was Rose, she was the nicest lady! Very personable. She asked us where we were from, stated that shes been in Hawaii for 20+ years and gave us tips on where to go. Rose along with everyone else at the hilton were so kind.... we were treated like family!BEAUTIFUL property, friendly staff..... amazing food. We will definitely be back here!!!! ", " This is a beautiful property with plenty to do and see that one could easily spend a week without leaving the grounds. We stayed in a One Bedroom Suite that had Ocean and mountain views, well worth the added expense. We didn't have time to wait for the tram or boat as they were slow and long waits. I used GPS on phone and it was exactly half a mile from self parking to our palace tower room. The lagoon was great for snorkeling and swimming with turtles and fish but I was not impressed with the dolphin pen. It seemed like a lot of dolphins segregated in small pens. Gas on the property was more than a dollar more than the rest of the island and two dollars more than Costco. ", " Beautiful and large property, with a few pools and an ocean-fed lagoon (ideal for snorkeling). A number of restaurants and stores on site, and a free shuttle to close-by shopping/restaurants. Everything you need for a nice vacation. You don't need to rent a car. You can arrange tours from the hotel (it might be best to do this before you arrive). It's a large hotel, but no venues seemed overcrowded. The staff was very friendly. Note that much of it closes by 9:00 PM. We'd like to go back someday. ", " 7th visit, always perfect. If you do not have kids, do not stay here as it is geared towards families with kids of all ages. yes, food is expensive, resort fees are not optional, nothing is inexpensive here, tram waits can annoy some, luau is not 100% perfect. point is to know all this before you make a reservation and just accept it. if you need options, rent a car, if you need a sandy beach, prepare to drive to it - that's it, do not show up then complain, do your homework first. confirm your building prior to check-in. lots to do on the island. definitely check out the top of Mauna Kea with a Jeep, reserve tour slots at the Subaru Telescope T W Th @ 11:30am for English speakers NAOJ.com also KEK twin telescopes always open to the public. Waimea market on Saturdays, Kona market Wed - Sun Hawaiian Style, Huggos, Poncho & Lefty's, Maria's, Merriman's in Waimea, Lava Tube north of KOA airport, Kona Brewing Co, Panda Express, WalMart, KMart, Target, Safeway for shopping, Waikoloa Town, King & Queen shops. Hawi, Waimea, Honoka'a towns, Waipio Valley overlook. ", " A travel program in Australia featured the Hilton Waikoloa many years ago and I remember thinking if only one day I might get the chance to stay there it would be a dream come true. Well my husband,16 yr. old daughter and myself have just returned from a week at this remarkable resort. It was everything I hoped for and more, the size did not faze us as it was so enjoyable meandering through the grounds and if we wanted to be lazy there was always the canal boat or tram. We never queued or waited for anything, the choices of restaurants was amazing and we tried them all and by Australian standards not at all expensive particularly for the quantity you received. A highlight for us was snorkelling in the lagoon with the beautiful green sea turtles and a game of golf at our doorstep.The staff were delightful,the grounds were immaculate, the facilities were spotlessly clean. Our accommodation in the Palace Tower was perfect for our family and we loved being in the middle of the resort. My dream came true and we are already planning our return holiday. Thankyou Hilton Waikoloa you will see us again ", " I could make this the shortest review ever by simply saying; this hotel is not cheap, it does not do everything well, but it does some things very well, it's a safe, remote place to take your kids, and if you are planning a trip to Hawaii, and thinking of going to the Big Island, you should consider going here. You must experience this place, because it has a unique grandeur no other place we have ever been has. I have been there 3 times since it was built. This hotel is rated as a 4-star hotel. I have never bothered to research what all the criteria are when a hotel is assessed and given it's star rating, but I am sure there are many criteria......for example, there are other more luxurious hotels, hotels with more amenities, hotels with more staff, hotels with.....you get the idea. What this hotel has is an ambiance like no other. Let me try to take you there;When you walk in to the lobby, it's open, breezy, large, but not too large, and not unlike what you would expect of this and other hotels with a 4-star rating, but it's what comes next that is quite unexpected and unique;This hotel is sort of \"U\" shaped, wrapped around a lava bay. There are 3 main building complexes, one at each end of the \"U\" and one sort of in the middle, connected by a long hallway, open to the air and ocean on one side, with an amazing art collection along the wall on the other side and all the way to the next building. These hallways between buildings are probably about a quarter mile long, maybe longer, but you get so immersed in appreciating all the art, you don't notice! You do notice a canal between you and the ocean with some interesting boats going by now and then. The other two ways are quicker but no less amazing. One is the monorail they had at Expo 86 in Vancouver. I live in Vancouver. had ridden on this during Expo 86 and the first time I was at this hotel in 1989 I was pleased to see it had gone to a better place. This hotel purchased it and had it installed albeit at ground level, between the buildings. It's fast, clean, air-conditioned, convenient.The third way comprises these Disneyland type boats that go between all the buildings following a canal that runs just outside the connecting hallways. These boats might hold 6 or 8 people, but they are seldom that full. You feel like you are on the jungle safari ride at Disneyland, you expect any moment to see the hippo come up and attack the boat! It's quite an enjoyable way to get around. We are never in a hurry no matter where we are, much less Hawaii, but if you are in a hurry the monorail might be quicker, or, if you are in for a nice walk take the connecting \"breezeways\". Enjoy and marvel at all the art, investigate the many places to eat, the gorgeous, lush greenery, and breath in deeply that intoxicating aroma of the many flowers...the same one you smelled as you got of the plane except even more intense if that's possible.This was one of the first hotels when it was built where you and your kids could \"swim with the dolphins\", it's not so unique in that respect anymore, but they have made it a much more interesting and inviting experience, one not to be missed. The food here is a cornucopia of wonderful tastes. The many and varied restaurants, menus, and venues will leave you little time to get out of this hotel, off the 60 or 70 acres it's on, and enjoy the rest of this huge island, which has much to offer. One thing I should mention is there is no beach at this resort. There is a nice beach close by next to it, and there is a neat lagoon, which is in front of the hotel, connected to the ocean, with a beach, where you can swim, snorkel, even rent kayaks. My son and I did so one day and had the pleasure of seeing and following sea turtles in this lagoon. It's not very deep, so they were easy to follow and see. Anyway, if you are thinking I have been quite smitten by this place, you're so right. It's not going to be everything to everyone, but I would go back in a moment, and have 3 times. That said, there are so many places to see and stay and so little time. If you have never been to this hotel, do so, you won't see another like this anywhere.Oh, before I go, if you do go to this hotel or the big island itself, you must go into Kailua Kona and have dinner at, or spend some time at the bar, at the old, Kona Inn. This is the place was built in the late 20's I think, and it's still exactly like it was, complete with many stuffed fish on the walls of the lobby. This is where Hemingway, Errol Flynn, John Wayne, etc. used to come to stay and go marlin fishing. The restaurant with the old, leather fan belts running between the ceiling fans is too much, but it's the bar you must experience.The bar has about 6 or 8 seats facing the beach, sit here, order some of the amazing red tuna sashimi and your favourite bevy, mai-tai's for me, and realize when you are sitting in one of those seats, you are sitting exactly where they were sitting, doing exactly what they were doing, all those years ago.....it gives one a perspective not often experienced.Anyway, enjoy the Hilton Waikaloan Village, it's unique, the big island, it's got so much to offer, like Hilo, and as always, have fun. ", " We arrived at this very large property and were pleasantly surprised with the ease of check-in and the great valet service. I mentioned that we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and were provided with a spectacular room to accommodate all four members of our family. There are many ways to get around this property. There is a train, which has times clearly posted at each stop. There is an electric boat, again with times clearly posted. You can also choose to walk, which we did on various occasions. We ate at several restaurants on the property and were pleased with the selection and quality. The staff was amazing in every area. They greeted us with a smile and helped meet and exceed our expectations.The look on my children's face was priceless when they saw the sea turtles cruise through the lagoon and snorkel to see the delightful sea creatures. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at KPC and were treated like royalty. It's also definitely worth taking a day to tour the island. It is a journey on to its self. This was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it for families and couples. ", " This is the first time I book a Spa at the Waikoloa Hilton, the reason is we play golf and there was never enough down time for me but due to aching body after three round of golf, I decide to take a day off and I had booked two session with them at the spa, the first one was a salt scrub and wrap session and the second one was a massage, while the first session was really unsatisfied because the masseuse was afraid to touch me and the wrap afterword was just the blanket that I was laying on, it was dumb and unsatisfied to the core. Thank God I didn't leave right away because the next treatment was Awesome! My massage with Carol Scholz was magical, she has unlimited knowledge on your body parts and she knows how to work out all the kinks in your body, originally I only have one hour with her but I have to extended to an hour and a half because she was just that good, after Carol's excellent message I forgot about t the first experience I had with them. When it's time to check out I had told the staff who's working there about the two separate experiences, she did not charge me for the salt scrub and that's where I need to give my props to Waikoloa Hilton for taking customer's word in a constructive way and stride to continue to provide excellent customer service to the customers. \"5 stars\"I immediately book a session for my husband with Carol Schultz, of course he also extended his time longer because he felt 1 hrs was just not enough with her. We talked about it afterward and we felt that she is the person that we will be coming to every year when we visit the big Island, she is the masseuse to go to \"folks\" Carol Schultz!!!! ", " My wife and I spent part of our anniversary trip at the Waikoloa village and had a great experience. We arrived late at night and check-in was a breeze. We stayed in one of the Makai rooms with an ocean front view. Even though our room was on the ground floor and right by the coffee shop, there was very little noise even during the morning breakfast rush. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We had dinner one night at KPC, the food was very good though very expensive. We sat on the patio by the ocean which had a perfect view of sunset, however after the sun goes down it does tend to get windy so make things that are likely to blow away are secured.We also ate at the Chinese restaurant that was good but not worth the price of the entrees. I had the Mongolian beef and it was not like the Mongolian beef I am used to, it seemed to be more bland than normal. Everything was a la carte, so sides like rice or noodles were extra. The lagoon was one of the most surprising features of the hotel. The Hilton lacks true beachside access and the coast along the hotel is volcanic rock so it is unusable as a beach. The resort has crafted it's own salt water lagoon with a sandy beach. It doesn't have the tidal action of the ocean but there are lots of tropical fish and sea turtles in the lagoon that make it almost a perfect place to snorkel. The hotel rents snorkel gear or there are several shops nearby that rent the same gear for cheaper prices. We rented gear for a week since we had a rental car and were driving to different spots on the island but the lagoon was the best snorkel dive we had all week. We are both looking forward to our next visit to the Big Island and staying at the Waikoloa Village resort. ", " We booked our trip thought Costco's Travel Service, and as always we got great value and an excellent property. Hilton Waikoloa Village is a village - its huge! We stayed at the Ocean Towers (there are like three different main areas to stay in this property). There is a tram that takes you to the various areas, or you can enjoy the multi-million dollar art collection that decorates the beautiful walkways throughout the property. The room was lovely, with a breathtaking view. Every day we woke up relaxed and happy looking at the view - the perfect way to get into the 'island' frame of mind. Our Costco package included the breakfast buffet (pricey at $30 per person per day if you don't do a package). Buffet was excellent - omelet and egg bar, and fresh fruit to die for - papaya and pineapple the brightest starts. Every staff member from the front desk, maid service, servers and property staff were excellent. It is not easy to make a property this size feel friendly and warm, but they do! We also at at Imari the Japanese restaurant on the property. Pricey as expected, but really a good value because the sushi quality and inventiveness were remarkable. Overall great place - we'd go back! ", " We stayed at Hilton Waikoloa Village in June. It was a beautiful place to stay. We had a Lagoon Tower Ocean and Dolphin room. View was spectacular. It was lovely to watch the dolphins regardless of the time of day. Yes you can get around the resort via boat or monorail. You could easily spend your whole vacation on the property. Pools were excellent. Restaurants on site were good. Shuttle available to the nearby King and Queen Shops. ", " This Hotel is perfect for families and couples. The hotel has all the activities suited for families, snorkeling and swim with the turtles in the Lagoon, photo with dolphins, nice polls and excellent surroundings. It has also adult only pools for a more quiet environment. The Legends of the Pacific Luau Show inside the Hotel completes the experience, thanks to Banquets Dept. for their excellent service and good food. ", " AWESOME!! We recently spent 7 nights on the Big Island and LOVED our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The resort is HUGE - there is a monorail and canal boat to assist with getting around, although we tended to walk. Yet it didn't feel crowded even though we were there over 4th July weekend. We stayed with a 13 and 15 year in 2 Inter connecting Rooms in the Lagoon Tower - they were the front rooms called Makai-Oceanside. I would rate this the BEST Tower within the resort based on views and location. It is an easy walk from Reception area, located at the Dolphin Lagoon (our rooms on the 6th Floor - 6318 + 6319) overlooked the dolphins - beautiful. We also had 180 degree ocean views. Our other family stayed on the bottom floor (level 1) and their 2 interconnecting rooms had level access to the grassed area in front of chess set - great for those with younger kids (Rooms 1324 & 1325 from memory). You can watch the littlies play as you lay back on your private sun lounges, drink in hand, watching the beautiful sunset each evening. RESTAURANTS: We dined within the Resort most nights. Lots of choice. The Mexican Cantina was our favourite, and we also liked the Italian (casual pizza night) and the Chinese. The Japanese looked great too, although we didn't go. We even ate in the Bar area near the pool tables (Malolo Lounge) one night, and the pork sliders were delicious! Grabbed fresh salads and snacks each day for lunch at the Orchid Market - so easy! ROOMS: The rooms are a great size. Good size bar fridge to stock with supplies. Highly recommend catching the trolley to the Queens Marketplace and visiting the Island Market for all food & alcohol supplies. Top quality. SHOPPING: A few shops on site for basic supplies, or head on the trolley to the Kings Shops and Queens Marketplace (a few minute scenic drive). GOLF: My husband played a few rounds and highly recommends a visit to the Mauna Lani Course - worth the fee! His fave out of 3 he played. TENNIS - Lianne the resident Tennis Pro runs a great clinic each morning. Highly recommend to hone your skills (racquets provided) - she is a real blast!! And a great workout. SERVICE: Top notch. All Resort staff were friendly and went out of their way to help. Our room had a leaky AirCon Unit night 1 and we were promptly moved the next day to 2 more inter-connecting rooms with a great view. This was much appreciated. TOURS: Make sure you do a volcano tour, and a helicopter one if the budget allows. WE WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR FOR SURE!!! ", " I enjoyed my second stay/second year at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for four (4) nights in June. I have been in both the Palace Tower and the Ocean Tower ... both are great in their own way. The walk or travel time to the Ocean Tower (and to my room, which was ocean front) was quite long ... but there are more amenities in the Ocean Tower (coffeeshop, cantina). There's probably not a bad room on the entire property!As a return guest, I can offer these recommendations:1. DEFINITELY participate in some of the free cultural activities! I thoroughly enjoyed the flower lei-making class; the feather lei-making demonstation (led by Lahela takati); and ancient Hawaiian games; the fishes of Hawaii walk.2. Walk the museum galleries (walkways) slowly and with appreciation! There are beautiful and historically significant works of art throughout the property -- take time to appreciate them.3. Visit the mini-zoo to glimpse the endangered nene goose/geese. Read the plaque and appreciate the sad fact that there are only 300-500 left. Appreciate and help protect them.4. Visit the buddha on the west point near the Ocean Tower at sunset. Please, do not let your children climb on him! The serenity and peacefulness were shattered on two nights I was there at sunset by clueless and rude parents who allowed their small children to climb up and over the buddha -- absolutely photo-bombing and ruining the experience.I can't recommend the Hilton Waikoloa Village enough -- if you travel there, please respect the property and appreciate all it has to offer. ", " We really enjoyed our stay here. This is a beautiful resort with a lot to see and do. The setting is spectacular and the grounds very well-maintained. I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful. I would recommend staying in the Lagoon tower because of its proximity to most of the resort's amenities. The room was spacious and housekeeping did a great job keeping it clean. Favorite experiences include the luau, paddle boarding on the lagoon, swimming in the Kona pool, lei-making, Shaka ice cream, an early morning latte at the Waikaloa Coffee cafe, and watching the sunset from the KPC restaurant. Overall, I can't imagine a better place for a family to stay at, and my kids can't wait to return. ", " First, the property is massive. There's a monorail/tram thing that transports people from point to point. It's that MASSIVE. So, I think the best thing to do is to lay out the pros and cons. Here they are from my perspective.PROS:*No question the property is attractive and kept up well. In the morning a garden crew army and pool maintenance folks attack it to be sure everything is picture perfect and functioning correctly.*Three pools (one of them for adults only in the Ocean Tower) and a large ocean water-connected lagoon. Two of the three pools are pretty substantial as is the lagoon, with all of that water space the crowds at each seemed smaller than they actually were.*One of the pools has a nice sized water slide and another long linear pool is connected with smaller water slides. Good for kids.*There is a boat that travels a river-like thing that runs from early afternoon until 10PM. It takes maybe 30 minutes to run its route and is a fun booze cruise in the night.*The towers are not all that tall, maybe six stories or so, and the elevator wait is not long.*They provide you with a DVD rental card that allows you to rent as many movies as you'd like, one at a time, during your stay from their rental boxes a la Redbox in front of each of the three towers. Very cool with a good selection of flicks for all tastes.*There is an off-grounds running/walking trail that can be 2.5 or 3.5 miles depending on which route you take. Starts at the hotel lobby. They have maps for you.*Ice water in the lobby during the day. Good for after the run.*Ocean views from the rooms with them, ours had one, are outstanding. One of the best sunsets ever, or at least in two weeks, happened while we were there. People were stopping dinner and getting out of the pools and standing and staring at it. Or snapping lots of pics.*There is a self-use laundry on site. Kinda weird that the machines are credit card only while the detergent dispenser is change only. There is a cash machine in the laundry. Four washers and four dryers. Couple bucks each per round. Ocean Tower.*The concierges were very helpful and each tower has one dedicated to it, along with those in the lobby.*Many on site restaurants and places to get a drink. Good coffee at the joints at either end of the monorail. Japanese, Chinese, pizza, Italian, American, \"Mexican.\"*All of the activities you would expect, e.g., hula lessons, ukulele lessons, mini golf including the night glow version, etc. Mostly pay-for unless you are Hilton Honors Gold or higher.*Some off site walkable restaurants and shops, including a mini-market with milk, beer, sandwiches, sushi, bread, fruits, snacks, and stale nuts. The hotel also has a shuttle if you'd prefer. But the shops are all close, no more than a 1/2 mile. (And the art walk at the hotel is 3/4 of a mile!)*Staff are friendly and try to be helpful.*If you are Hilton Honors Gold or higher they give you ten $10 coupons for use at the hotel complex in lieu of an executive lounge, which the property does not have.*Rooms are nicely appointed standard Hilton fare with attentive and quick room staff. AC works great and turns off automatically when you open the sliding glass doors to the lanai. Eco-wise.CONS:*It's quite expensive and everything on the grounds is expensive.*If you are for some reason unable to walk well, the grounds are MASSIVE and you will have trouble getting from one place to another, unless you want to spend large amounts of time waiting for the monorail. And even then you will still need stamina to get to 80% of the property. This didn't bother us, and as soon as we realized that walking was quicker we stopped using the monorail. But this makes getting around kind of slow. I can't emphasize enough how large this place is.*This is a paradise for most kids. So if you've got kids and can afford to go here, they'll dig it. Now if you are not with kids\u2026 maybe one of the other resorts in this area would be better. Maybe. It's cool regardless I guess, because the grounds are awesome.*The mai-tais were pretty so-so. And we had many at many different places on grounds and off. The \"lava flows\" are a good fru-fru drink.*Self parking, at $27 per day, is steep and depending on what's going on can land you with a bit of a hike just to reach the hotel lobby (and uphill, btw). If it's full, and it was one night when we were there, add another $5 for valet plus tip plus wait. And there aren't really other options.*The hotel is about 18 miles from the airport with essentially nothing between, and nothing nearby (that would be within a couple of miles). So when you are there, you are there. And that is certainly Hilton's point. Captive audience.*Although very nice, some of the staff seem kinda clueless when you ask questions about where something is, how to get to something, can you get something, what time something closes, etc. I don't know, it happened several times. When in doubt, talk to the concierges as they were on top of it all.*There isn't a beach coterminous to the hotel, but you don't need one. The ocean is right there and you have many water options. Beaches are fairly close with a car, maybe 15 minutes.*Anyone who has seen CNN's \"Blackfish\" will cringe when they see the dolphins in the small pond that's used to entertain guests who want to swim with and touch those animals. We've gotten to the point where we don't like to see big, highly intelligent, highly social, highly mobile mammals be they dolphins, orcas, elephants, or lions caged for our entertainment. If that doesn't bother you then you can have a swim with dolphins, for a fee.*The spirit of Aloha is alive and well on the 4th of July. Yes, that's a Con. Check it out 7/4/2015 and you'll get it.There you go. I give it a five circle rating because the place is impressive. Many things are beautiful and wonderful about it. The downsides are mostly tied to size and the manageability of that size. It's expensive, but it's Hawaii. What do you want? ", " The South Pacific Body Ritual at the Hilton Waikoloa Village- with Tonia was amazing! I have had a similar treatment at the Miraval but the massage portion at the Miraval was FAR shorter and less intense and didn't include the warm water shower during the scrub in a wet room. Quite the experience! My friend also had this treatment with Don (?) who was also fantastic. I often hear from local friends that this spa is less \"hawaiian and local feeling\" but I thought the treatment and facilities were outstanding. The steam steamed up in an instant- faster than any steam that I have ever been in and the sauna went up to 190 degrees if desired (you can adjust the temperature). Everything is super clean, the service is excellent, and overall I can't recommend this spa enough. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is beautiful! The art display around the entire property is magnificent! Great property with awesome views of the mountains and ocean! Very quiet and peaceful property. Check-in was fast and friendly.We enjoyed the fish, landscaping and awesome views! ", " Had a great time with Grandkids. We are from Kona so a pleasure to take the Grandkids there The staff and help was great will try it again.When thay come visit us again or we have other vivitors we will plan on visiting the resort again. ", " Have traveled around the world and by far this is the best hotel I've ever been to. Since it is in a remote location the many inlucded ammenities make it possible to be satisfied. Such a beautiful please to stay. ", " Stayed here for an on site wedding. Really impressed with the property and staff. Bring comfortable walking shoes in case you take the tram going the wrong way because 64 acres is a big deal. Felt a little guilty to be there without the kids, so we'll be sure to bring them with us next time. This place very family friendly - lots of things to do to keep the kids occupied! ", " We stayed here for our wedding anniversary. We loved it! The pool amenities are awesome! We spent a whole day just lounging in the pools and lagoon. Great bar service too for food and drinks. The resort grounds are huge but there is plenty of transportation to get you from one side to the other. No complaints from us regarding this. There are many shops and restaurants to choose from, which we loved. The resort is beautiful and the rooms were comfortable. We had a great view of the ocean and dolphins from our room too. The resort also has a spa, which was excellent!I am so glad we chose to stay at this resort and do recommend! ", " Definitely stay in lagoon tower if you have kids..close to everything you need..pools, slide, dolphin, lagoon, lobby, tram, luau..booked Macai package 2 queens oceanfront..perfect for us and our 2 kids with a view that was incredible of both the ocean and the dolphins. Kids loved the tram and boat for transportation but we also walked lots of times just for exercise and to see things in the hotel. Snorkeling was great in the lagoon..slide at lagoon pool was the best but slide at ocean pool was very fast and fun too. Food very pricey..went to walmart in kona and stocked up on breakfast and lunch foods to save money. Also a target, kmart and costco in kona near the airport. ", " W-O-W !!! That is the best way to describe the Hilton Waikola Village Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii. I thought of words like\u2026amazing\u2026or incredible\u2026or even unbelievable. However, those words just don\u2019t give it justice. After checking in and as we rode on the tram to get to our section of the resort, we kept looking at each other and silently mouthing the word \u201cWOW\u201d to each other. The grounds were beautiful and the variety of artwork that you experienced with every single blink of your eye left us all without words and with our mouths gaped open like idiots (and this is coming from a family that has done quite a bit of national and international travel). Within 1 hour of arriving, we started making calls to stay longer. So, in an effort to keep this as short as possible\u2026I will truly attempt to summarize this DON\u2019T MISS RESORT! I\u2019m adding some of the pix that I took too, These are all from the resort grounds. The resort consists of 3 hotel building communities. Each of these are connected by walking galleries, a tram train and a tram boat. There is also a golf course and a putt putt course (that has glow in the dark at night). Each has an assortment of places to eat/drink, activities (options for kids and adults), pools, fish, birds and variety of large scale artwork. While the art was in a vast array of styles, our family was most impressed with the large scale sculptures in marble, wood and stone. They were huge and with incredible detail! The resort has several pools with waterfalls and slides. There is a protected beach lagoon to snorkel, paddle board (lights underneath for night), kayak, and more. They have a top rated dolphin encounter program that many of the locals even recommended. The island\u2019s most popular Luau is also on site. There are loads of activities to sign up for, our daughter especially enjoyed lei making. In addition, it is rated the island\u2019s BEST VALUE! I truly could rave on and on, but instead will close by saying, \u201cYOU MUST STAY HERE!\u201d. Our family enjoys visiting new places each time we plan a trip. However, we have all agreed that we are coming back to this resort! I guarantee that your entire family will love it! ", " Spent a week at the Hilton Waikaloa Village to attend a family wedding. The resort is amazing with lush tropical gardens leading down to the ocean! It has many swimming pools, a beachside lagoon with fish and turtles, international restaurants, dolphins, trams and boats plus spacious accommodation. Well worth a visit! ", " My husband, son and I visited this resort in May. We had a wonderful time. This was our 4or 5th visit to this resort. One of the main reasons we come back is the excellent concierge service, Wesley Martinez was very helpful in assisting us in planning our week of activities. The resort was beautiful and very clean. However the only thing that might be difficult if you have trouble walking is that it is a very large resort and there is a lot of walking. Other than that it is absolutely beautiful. There are turtles and fish in the lagoon. You can watch the dolphins every day while you sit near by and enjoy lunch or a drink. There are multiple pools some are great for entertaining young kids and teens. Other pools on the property are perfect for adults to enjoy and relax. The spa is awesome a must while you are there. Be sure to go off the property to try different restaurants as hotel is pricey and food is mediocre. ", " It's all in what in you want and where you stay. I was concerned by the reviews I'd read about people spending too much of their vacation time getting around and out of the resort. With three large towers spread over acres of \"park-like\" land, distances can seem daunting. We had done some online research so we understood the resort's layout. Our originally assigned room was located in the Palace Tower, which is in the center of the resort, but with the assistance of Frank, we decided on check-in to upgrade to an ocean-view in the Lagoon. We are so glad we did. The Lagoon Tower is the closest to parking (an easy five minute walk to your car.), as well as the lobby, major pools and lagoon. It also has the most updated rooms. Our room, on the second floor, was just steps away from the coffee shop, where Cindy provided coffee and pastries with a smile. We could easily have taken the train or boat to access the rest of the resort, but found that nothing was more than a ten or fifteen minute walk away, made all the more enjoyable by the art and crafts displayed along the hallways. The front desk has free copies of a book with the descriptions and history of each piece for a self-guided art walk. An enjoyable way to spend 30 minutes to an hour. We loved spending our early mornings watching the waves as we sipped our coffee on the lanai. Outside activities included taking the stand up paddle boards out on the lagoon. The lack of waves and clear water made it fun and easy to look for turtles and fish. We did not participate in the Dolphin Quest but did enjoy watching others do it. We have seen reviews that ding the Hilton for it's lack of beach. They really should ding the entire island if they find that a problem. The majority of the shoreline is lava rock. There is a beautiful sand beach an easy five minute walk north of the Hilton. We did not have too much interaction with Hilton staff, but were very pleased with our housekeeping service. On checkout, there was a small problem with one of our charges which Josh took care of immediately. It was so nice of him to tell us that he didn't want us leaving remembering a problem rather than our good time. He was professional, friendly and a great ambassador to the hotel. He left us with a smile and two bottles of cold water for our drive to Volcano Park. ", " This was the second time I stayed here - the first time was back in 1991 when it was a Hyatt Regency. The hotel has aged well. As other's have stated, the property is huge - the plus is there's something for everyone; the minus, of course, is the long distances between various venues. We chose this resort because it seemed like the best one on the Big Island for kids. Our nine-year-old daughter loved it. While I thought she'd be most interested in the network of pools, with interconnecting slides and waterfalls, she truly loved the lagoon. This resort has a lagoon fed by the ocean, which provides a great place for snorkeling. There is a large diversity of fish, and the lagoon is frequently visited by Green Sea Turtles. It is incredible to see these amazing creatures up close, and was thrilling experience for my daughter. After snorkeling in the lagoon, my daughter never returned to the pool.The dining, as expected, was expensive. We booked a package which included the breakfast buffet in the rate. Thus, we usually ate a large, late breakfast, then followed that up with dinner at the Lagoon Grill. The burgers there were fantastic, and the seating offered a view overlooking the dolphin pool. We usually went there right before sunset, so we could watch the sun slowly sink into the Pacific.Unlike others have reported, we had no problems with check-in. However, we drove over from Kilauea, thus didn't arrive the same time as dozens of others on the same flight. We were in the Lagoon Tower, last room on the south end. We thought the room location was fantastic, it seemed to have the best ocean view at the resort. Supposedly, these rooms also came with the \"MAKAI Experience\", which was supposed to include all sorts of extras. Most of these we never saw - the only \"extra\" we appreciated was the two free bottles of water each day.Overall, this is a great hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ", " First class...food, room, everything about it and the tours they offered were awesome..imagine going to breakfast from your room by boat??? Saw whales, just breath taking views and service was first class. Again, our entertainment one night was Cheryl Crow, a luo?? Our room faced the golf course which was okay with us...just an awesome place..hope to go back one day we have been married 38 years and just maybe one day we will go back.First class. ", " Excellent stay and location. Beautiful resort with lots to do. Location is central to everything on the island. Food expensive but great quality and selection. Try Lava Lava Beach Club for a romantic dinner. ", " This was our second stay in 6 years and despite other reviewers complaints of this resort's showing her age, we still found the resort to be a gorgeous place to stay. As Hilton Diamond members we were thrilled when we were given an upgrade to an ocean front room on the 6th floor of the Ocean Tower. The view from the room was awesome and we could watch the sunsets from our balcony. The balcony was narrow but very long so you could see different areas of the resort. Yes the restaurants were very expensive but we were given vouchers that saved us $20/couple. Loved the breakfast buffet. We picked up a lot of snacks and lunches at the Queens Marketplace down the road. Loved eating at Lava Lava Beach Club for sunset dinners right on the shores of A Bay. Wnjoyws snorkeling with my 4 turtle buddies in the Hilton's lagoon. Best time to snorkel is in the morning -- water is really clear and the turtles and fish were easy to watch. You can also swim out to the bay that feeds into the lagoon. The later the day, the more people, paddle boards, cloudy water, ugh. Yes, there is this 'towel card' program that is a pain but you can still request extra towels. You're either just given the extra towels or a log is kept with the number of extra towels you checked out. The nice covered cabanas are no longer free, however. I believe it's $50 for the whole day but if you grab one by the Ocean tower your chances of using one for free are pretty good. We noticed the trams were running pretty often with 2 always in transit at the same time going in opposite directions. It's a lovely walk to the lobby if you decide to skip the tram or the boat. We had a late flight out but staying at the resort was no problem. Had a late check out then checked our bags for the afternoon. You can also request a hospitality suite so that you can shower and change in a regular hotel room before your departure. They are available on a first come first serve basis so given yourself some extra time just in case there's a wait. We left around 4:30 pm, went shopping in Kona, had dinner and made it to the airport with only a couple hours to wait. Am eagerly awaiting the next time we can stay at this resort. ", " This place is big, but it is pretty amazing. Perfect for folks traveling with kids, like us with our 4 year old. Awesome water features with lots of fish. The lagoon is awesome and offers paddle boarding, snorkeling, and swimming with lots of wildlife such as turtles and fish. Food on site is great and the dolphin experience, while costly, was a highlight for sure. ", " This is our third visit to the Hilton Waikoloa and we still love it. The grounds are stunning and the new Makai rooms are beautiful. I highly recommend staying in the Lagoon Tower (Makai). It is close to the pools and the main lobby. The views of the ocean and dolphins are also stunning. Many reviews complain about the size of the resort. It is a large resort and I love that. If you do not want to walk this might not be a good choice for you. We love the walks. There is so much to see and experience. Everything is beautiful and all the walking routes have art or landscape to enjoy. It does take time to get around so if you are in hurry this might not be the place for you. We come to Hawaii to slow down so we enjoy the walks, team and leisurely boat rides. I recommend taking a boat ride around the resort during sunset at least once. It is beautiful and relaxing. Food is expensive here. If that is a concern there is economical and good food at the Queens marketplace. We stop in Kona and stock up on drinks and snacks at Target. Overall, this is a fabulous place and I highly recommend it. I think it is especially well planned for families with kids of all ages.  ", " There were 17 family members of all ages staying at this resort and it was amazing for all of us! We couldn't have asked for better service, staff or comfort for our stay. We all felt pampered the entire trip and it was a dream vacation for all of us. ", " If you come here you will NEVER want to leave!!! My husband and I got married here and all of our guests except one stayed at the resort and the only complaint they had is that it is big (which really isn't that big of a deal). The resort is BEAUTIFUL and there is so much to do! Sometimes it;s hard to motivate yourself to get off the resort and explore the rest of the island, but again, not that big of a deal when you are at such a beautiful place. The rooms are comfortable and spacey, the suites are even better. If you get a chance to use their spa, do it! It's amazing and totally worth it! My only real complaint is the internet is SLOW and you have to log in every single time you use your device which is kind of annoying! Oh and they only process credit cards, it's weird. At check-in I had this whole ordeal because I was using my bank debit/credit card. They said I couldn't use put anything on my room (e.g., room service) since I didn't have a straight credit card. However, my maid of honor used her bank debit/credit card so maybe I just got someone who wasn't that helpful. ", " It's Hilton so it should be great.And it is.Love this resort. Just want to stay here next time and don't want to go outside this resort because you will get everything here what you will see in Big Island.One of the best hotel(resort) I stayed. Very nice view of ocean and palm trees. Watched sunset from buddha statue on longest day of the year.!Only problem is we have to walk too much from valet parking to our partial ocean view room (5063), which was awesome. It was like ocean front room from were you can watch sunset without any obstruction It's 700 meters.!! and if you wait to boat or tram it will be take longer.! so except this when you book it.Once inside hotel you will not feel to go outside hotel and that's the reason I stayed in 2 different hotel during my stay. One this one and other in Courtyard Marriott next to Kona Pier(downtown). Valet parking was very nice as they were bringing cars very fast. (You can see them running for your car.!)Food is expensive but that's what you get when you stay in nice resort.! ", " A great value as we booked through Costco Travel. The view is amazing and the grounds are beautifully landscaped and cared for. The customer service was fantastic. I have to give an extra thanks to Desiree at the Big Island Breakfast. We had mentioned we were leaving early the following day for an adventure in Hilo. The next morning when I walked in, the hostess greeted me and said she had my boxes prepared, reached under the counter and offering to go boxes, cup holder, two insulated cups with lids and of course plastic utensils! I was pleasantly surprised and very appreciative! There are many choices but if you are looking at this hotel the view of the dolphin quest is worth booking alone for that. You will not believe how close you get to the dolphins on the walkway. That may have been my highlight of the stay. :-) My husband enjoyed the lagoon. Fantastic resort! ", " What a huge property! There is so much to do or just rest with a book by the pool or by the lagoon. There are so many pools on the property and a beautiful lagoon. There is also a dolphin areas that you walk right up to and watch them play.Food is great also. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is the most wonderful resort I have ever seen. Their Lagoon was awesome, the boat ride to our hotel. Crazy fish and birds are along the waterway to your room. I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but it was sort of pricey for a breakfast. ", " Beautiful grounds with lots to see and do. Amazing views, great rooms, and wonderful experience. The only draw-back was the cost of food and drinks. Either bring your own, or walk or take the trolley to the King/Queen shopping centers for more options. Unless you plan to drive around the island, you don't really need a car. ", " Great family vacation, loved the resort, all the amenities, the food, the pools, and the beautiful lagoon. Nice variety with all the restaurants on the property. Very easy to get to other attractions on the island. Very close to the airport as well. ", " Well, here I am, going on 3 years of marriage and finally writing a review of the Hilton Waikoloa. Shame on me for waiting for so long, as it was a tremendous trip. I love this place. Clean, neat, and lots to do. I loved using the SUP in the lagoon; I loved walking the grounds; I loved the gym. We never used the boat ferry; we walked everywhere and lo and behold, after a week of eating and drinking I think we both lost weight. As I mentioned, we were there on a honeymoon in September. Since school had already begun, there were no kiddos around and the pools were near empty. If you are able to, and if you don't want to navigate around many children, book your vacation in September and October. That being said, I can imagine this is a great, great place to take families. There is so much to do and see. The pools are amazing, the staff was so nice.We booked our vacation through Costco and had the breakfast buffet everyday - also highly recommend. The omelette bar was to die for. Look online for deals; they are there and then you won't be nickeled and dimed for everything. Mahalo Waikoloa Village and aloha a hui hou :) ", " Went out here with my sister and kids. They have something for everyone. There are many restaurants, the Kamuela Provision Company had unbelievable steaks and fresh local fish, the Luau was the best we've seen, then there is sushi and lots of comfort foods in the beach bar & grills (there are several). The rooms are clean and comfortable and either mountain or water view are both beautiful views. The grounds are amazing, spread out there are several buildings of rooms each connected by a tram train and a boat system. The resort activities included lei making, hula classes and ukulele classes. Really a great experience. ", " The Makai Towers are quite nice, especially the rooms overlooking the dolphin pool. The property is spread out but if you are unable to walk the 5-10 minutes between locations, you may take the boat or the train/tram. Both are quite slow but you are in Hawaii. The restaurants are all quite good including the Cantina and Italian restaurants for casual dining. Lots of pools and the \"beach\" is actually a lagoon inside the property. This features a number of activities including stand up boards and snorkeling. Wifi is very good in rooms. Pay for either valet or self-parking. Quite a bit of shopping on site and upscale shopping center and then off property dining with 5 minutes. ", " I will always make this place a destination vacation! I am relaxed every second i'm here. The views are spectacular of the ocean and the Lagoons. Between the tram and the boats the grounds the feeling is purely magical. We did everything we could! Swam with the dolphins (since we could watch them daily from our room we could not resist!), Snorkeled, Kayaked, Ocean side dining, and of course the Luau. You can do everything on the property, however we also took a catamaran snorkel tour with Ocean Sports that was a must do too. We have been to the volcano which is worth doing at least one time if you have the time. We also love Hilo and Kona! There is too much to do on this island you will never get board. I love a combination of relaxing and exploring. I tried the Lomi Lomi massage and it was different then a typical massage, I loved it! I have done lots of traveling with and with out my family and we all agree this is one of our all time favorite places. Here is my must do list: Everything above plus - indulge in a fresh flower lei they sell them everywhere, Go to Kona farmers market, shopping and dinning downtown Kona and Hilo too, drink Kona coffee, eat the fresh fruit and mac nuts, especially Papaya and Apple Bananas are the best. Try a MALASADA (Tex's is on the other side of the island). Listen to local island music stations. Attend a Luau. They never ever get old to me! Everyone is different. The one here had the best food I've ever had at a Luau, lots of drinks, and the show was about the history of the Big Island. The fire dancer was AMAZING! I totally love and miss this place! ", " The best place we ever stayed at. The resort was unbelievable. Great place for families and couples. We will be back! Our trip tp the big Island would not have been nearly as enjoyable if we stayed somewhere else. The resturants were pricey but the food was great. It takes 900 people to run this place. You always get what you pay for. I believe it was a great value compared to other places we could ave stayed at. The atmosphere is wonderful here and feels like fantasy land. That is what vacations are for. ", " I just thought I'd take a moment to share our experience at this wonderful property. My wife and 2 kids (preteens) accompanied me on a 3 day stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. We stayed in a one bedroom with king sofa sleeper in the lagoon tower with the Makai experience package. The room is very spacious with 2 balconies, large sitting area, and dining area, and separate bedroom area. Seems renovated well. The perfect size for a family of four. The grounds are very well maintained. The architecture, artwork, and integration of natural beauty gives this property a local character second to none. Some may criticize the size as being too Disneyland like, but my family felt like it allowed us to explore and feel fresh throughout our 3 day stay. We found ourselves taking new routes back to the room just to explore the beautiful property. The kids enjoyed the tram and boat options to explore the property. Although there is no large sand beach on the ocean, a well marked path leads to Anaehoomalu beach which is a fifteen minute walk. The water slides were managed well by staff and we felt comfortable letting the kids go up and down without our supervision. Also the kids loved the chance to check out dvd movies. The selection was good and they found something every night. However there were fewer available ps3 games so if your kids want to play it may be helpful to bring your own. The check in process was very smooth, well prepared for our arrival, and staffed well. There was no line to speak of. It was a Sunday arrival which may be a little lighter load perhaps. My only suggestion for improvement for the entire stay is to analyze the needs for staffing upon the drive in arrival. There is a valet parking counter, and those attendants are working hard to keep afloat of guests retrieving cars as well as new check ins. These attendants are spread too thin for handling the luggage coming out of he new arrivals, and those exercising the self park option were stacking up waiting for luggage to be handled. I self parked, then checked in while my wife waited with the bags, and even after I completed my check in process, still no attendant. But that was soon forgotten as we experienced outstanding service from the Hilton staff. We found the staff as a whole to be very friendly, helpful, and concerned about our comfort during our stay. I wanted to mention specifically Leilani who works in the tennis/fitness center at ocean sports. She went out of her way to move us to a court with less \"distractions\". We spent one hour playing tennis and she came by about 4 times to offer cool towels, pitchers of ice water, and to check and see how we were doing. My only other comparison would be to the Omni Amelia Island where there was no court side service of any kind. I'll see how Grand Wailea fares in comparison, to see if this a Hilton standard throughout the chain. The restaurant staff were friendly, readily available, and attentive to service. I found the housekeeping staff to be efficient and room readiness for daily service and upon arrival was prompt and well handled. We stayed during the first week in June and the property had plenty of space around the pools for easily available stretchers. The property felt like guests were present, but by no means over run. The main Island Breakfast buffet near the convention center was excellent and the omelet station was manned by what seemed to be a master chef handling 6 simultaneous orders of omelets, with no burned eggs or mistakes. I have never seen that at even a Ritz Carlton, or JW Marriott property.All in all would love to return to this property and would not hesitate to recommend this to friends and other colleagues. Thank you to the entire Hilton Waikiloa staff for a great vacation. ", " What a gorgeous property! We stayed here while we were visiting the big island. We rented a car and drove ourselves around, but I could totally see never leaving the resort. Our room was large and quiet with the exception of the birds that woke us up in the morning, but that was part of the charm. The gondolas were not running while we were there as they were under maintenance, but we knew that ahead of time. The trams were perfectly adequate to get us around, but walking was nice, too. Highly recommend! We would stay there again in a heartbeat! ", " If you are not lucky enough to be staying here while visiting the Big Island, you must go for a visit.Ride the gondola from the lobby to the end and grab a coffee on the way down to see the dolphins. Its a beautiful property. ", " My husband and experienced the beauty and tranquility of this part of Hawaii . It is wonderful to rent a vehicle and do your own driving. Very safe and scenic, the Hilton has everything one could possibly desire,pleasant staff, not a bad room, they all have ocean views. We would love to go back again. ", " Easy to lose oneself in this location - plenty to do for families, consider hiring a car if you want to see local sites. Distance from lobby can be a disadvantage if you miss the transport options. The resort has a captive audience so think twice about eating in-house, however quality of food very good. Kings and Queens offer excellent alternatives. ", " Wow what an interesting property! It is a little time consuming getting from place to place. There is a tram that you board to take you to different locations on the property. You can also walk, but it will take you a considerable amount of time. I was a little concerned for the safety of children that were not paying attention when the tram came through the lobby. This seems more like a hotel suited for business travelers attending conventions. We were charged an additional resort fee upon arrival that I did not expect. There is also $30 parking fee for rental cars. The staff was outstandingly wonderful! I was shocked that some of them even remembered me by name. Some of the buildings appeared to be more recently built. There are restaurants, coffee shops and small variety shops. They can be expensive, but there is a shopping center a short distance from the hotel. We found it less expensive to go outside the property for a meal. There are a lot of lava rocks that collect little pools of water. In the evening I had a very difficult time with mosquitoes biting me. This hotel seemed much more laid-back than the hotel property on Waikiki. It is a beautiful property, but be prepared for the expense. Take an evening walk and enjoy the sunset. ", " a fun sprawling hotel with Disneyland like ambiance.visited July 2011, we got a family daily pass for about $80, just the use of the pools and the grounds.We were staying at the Marriott nearby, so there was a lot more to see and do there.It was fun taking the train around and exploring all the areas.Good for family with pre teens. ", " This was a dream vacation.We arrived there on 5.24 and stayed until 5.28 A couple of quick notes for anybody that has never been here.- You don\u2019t even need to go anywhere \u2013 they basically brought everything to you. The lagoon is amazing \u2013 you will be swimming with sea turtles. ( We went snorkeling on a boat and unfortunately didn\u2019t run into a one in the ocean.)- They have dolphin quest \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan of this as well but if you\u2019re a dolphin freak like me it is a great option to get closer to them.- Hotel gives you almost all the opportunities for any tours in the Island. (helicopter to zip line , snorkeling to day trips) ( I strongly recommend a tour (Volcano tour (takes your whole day) and tour guide (Marcus)- If you can request him \u2013 he is such a great tour guy!)Thank you Hilton Waikoloa Village and our amazing tour guide MARCUS - greetings from Dallas ", " It's again a great resort. I used to visit this Hilton property once every year and I can say that it's still impressive! The environment and facilities (including fitness center, spa, swimming pool, outdoor facilities) are great, the food (especially the KPC with wonderful sea view and the Kiran with nice Chinese food) is excellent though it's a-bit over-priced. It's everything one would expect to stay in a resort! ", " This property is truly amazing - multiple towers, tram service between towers or take a 'water taxi' style boat. The lagoon is great 'beachfront' with tons of water sports for kids. Dolphin Lagoon is always a lot of fun. We've been here many times and it never gets tired. Stay in the Lagoon Tower - newly renovated and closer to the main lobby so you can walk if you want to. ", " My wife and I recently returned to the Hilton Waikoloa only 6 months after recently being there. This hotel does an excellent job and its size and location make it ideal for a wonderful Hawaiian experience. Let's start with the fairly new \"king bed\" cabanas. Wow, once we tried one on our earlier stay, we booked it again for 8 days straight. Unbelievable e.g comfort, view, service - it doesn't get any better!!! Then there are the rooms, especially in the Lagoon Tower - very nice!! Lastly the food, what can I say.....you could stay a week, never leave the property and never eat in the same place twice and BTW, the food is very good. Before discovering this gem, we were staying at the Grand Wailea, the Mauna Lani or the Four Seasons, not anymore. Did I mention those king bed cabanas??? :) ", " We have been to Europe, So. Am., the Caribbean, & all over the USA but we have never stayed someplace like this. Expansive, manicured, rail & boat travel to move you around the village, pools & waterfalls, restaurants & bars, lounge chairs & cabanas, all take in beautiful views of the ocean, lagoons & man made rivers & falls.  The employees are happy to see you & serve you, the staff keeps it looking clean & neat, & their art budget has to be astronomical. This place is worth every penny. ", " Amazing resort in Hawaii. You feel like you are driving in the desert and all of a sudden you come across this lushness paradise. Definitely worth the stay and the Island is only so big...meaning that you can visit just about anywhere from this resort. ", " We spent last week at this resort due to a convention my husband attended and we really enjoyed it. If you've never been to the Big Island of Hawaii, prepare yourself- coming to this resort from the Kona airport means seeing lots of lava fields. There are several other climates on the island, but this area is lava beds. Don't fear, though, they've carved some lovely resorts out of the lava!I see very mixed reviews on rooms, but ours in the Ocean Tower (rm. 2060) was just fine. It looked out across a golf course hole and lava shoreline onto the ocean- really peaceful. I've read complaints about loud birds either waking people up or keeping them up, but while I could definitely hear the birds at this location, the air conditioner drowned them out fine. I recommend purchasing the restaurant discount card at check in if you're going to be there several days and plan to eat on premises. You'll get 2- $10 vouchers plus 10% off all food AND drinks. We saved quite a bit using this card (take a picture of it with your phone in case you forget it- they can get the numbers they need from the picture).So, here's what we loved about this resort: 1.) The pools are really lovely. There was a smallish one for adults only outside our room door, which is a nice option. There was a long group of small pools near the Ocean Tower that are connected by little waterslides- very good for small fry. Over near the Lagoon Tower there is a HUGE pool area (Kona) with a \"sand\" bottom for little ones closed off by a low wall, then several bigger circles leading into a waterfall area where there's a fun \"big kid\" waterslide. There's also a hot tub tucked away in among the waterfall area. You can get drinks and food poolside from the pool bar in this area, and there was also a smaller bar area and roaming waitress in the Ocean Tower pool. Food and drink abound everywhere!2.) The lagoon was fun. If you like the idea of a beach area, they have a lagoon right in the heart of the resort where you can swim and snorkel. My husband and son (age 11) enjoyed the snorkeling (we packed our own snorkels and fins, but you could rent them). At this location you also rent paddle boats, kayaks, and bikes on floats. There were large turtles in the area in the mornings and snorkelers were paddling along beside them. Pretty cool. 3.) Transportation- The resort is really large, but thankfully they have two trams that take you from one side to the other (we rode them in swimwear- anything went). There are TV-like screens at each stop that will tell you how long it will be until the next tram will arrive so look for those. They also have Disney-like boats that go from place to place (on a rail system or something like that- no steering required) which start running at 2 p.m. each day. You can also see how far away a boat is from the nearest stop on that TV screen. The boats are particularly pleasant in the evening- you can see an amazing amount of stars without all the city lights I'm used to! Very nice way to go back to your room from dinner, or just take a cruise around the complex. Be prepared though- if you're trying to get somewhere at a particular time, LEAVE YOUR ROOM EARLY! Or wear your walking shoes- we ended up walking several times when it was going to be a long wait for the trams. There are generally several ways to get somewhere at this resort- either walking through the open-air corridors past some pretty amazing Asian artwork- or over bridges and through beautiful lawn areas.4.) Lots of on-site restaurants. We ate at most of the restaurants since we were there so long. Here's a rundown:- Big Island Breakfast- A very nice breakfast buffet, including making omelets to order. It was $29.95 for adults and $10.00 for kids under 12 (take 10% off with the discount card). I could rarely justify this price for myself for breakfast, so I ate off the menu once. I didn't save a lot, but I saved some that way. This place has huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the lagoon- really a beautiful view. Give them the discount card when you check in at the front desk at the foot of the stairs.- Lagoon Grill- Great place to watch the dolphins in their little lagoon (TOO little lagoon) or watch the ocean if you sit in the right area. Burgers, salads, etc. Food was fine. - Boat Landing Cantina- This was right near our room. Comfy location for quiet meal. Mexican style food. Food was fine. You can catch the boat here and it's right by the end of the line for the tram in the Ocean Tower.- Malolo Lounge- My son and I stumbled on to this one right near the lobby one night and ate on the back patio which is shady and nice. If it wasn't cloudy, I imagine you could see the mountains behind it. They had some healthier options like pita bread, carrots and celery with garlic hummus (which was a rather unpleasant shade of yellow but tasted good), salads, etc. And I saw another Trip Advisor review indicating they had a GREAT Mai Tai, so I tried it...it WAS GREAT! It turned me on to Mai Tais for the rest of the trip, although few were this good. They have music in here some evenings, and on Luau nights, you can hear the Luau very clearly.- Waikola Coffee Co.- We had smoothies made with beautiful fresh fruit here, plus banana nut bread, croissants, etc. A light breakfast or lunch place.- KPC- Kamuela Provision Company- Wow, what a view if you sit outside! Best view of the ocean in the whole place. Definitely make reservations. If you want to ensure an outdoor seat, you can pay an extra $25 per person in your party- we made an early reservation at 6:00 (they open at 5:30) and it wasn't a busy season, so we got an outside table without problem. You could spend a lot of money here, or go for salad and appetizer and spend less. The guy who lights the torches all around the resort every evening started out here by blowing on a shell horn. Kind of fun! If you want to feel like you've dined with the best view possible at this resort, this is the place to do it. (They did have a nice kids' menu, too.)-Orchid Marketplace- We didn't go in here but ordered food at the Kona pool from here. It arrived poolside, which was fun. The pizza was good. One thing to note: This is a big resort and they feed a lot of people every day. The food wasn't outstanding anywhere, but it also wasn't bad anywhere. We ate dinner at Roy's at the nearby King's Marketplace and it was fine, but also not spectacular. Keep your expectations in line and be happy when you get a great meal. ;-)We used the concierge to book several tours- I'll list them separately with reviews in the activities area, but here's a quick rundown:- Hawaii Forest & Trail waterfall tour- Takes you north 45 minutes to a rainforest area of the island. Much greener than the lava area where you're staying! Highly recommend if you can get around well- lots of climbing and descending of steep stairs in the forest. Chance to swim in a waterfall. GREAT tour guide in Matt. Terrific fun riding in a Pinzgauer! (I didn't know what one was either- check out their website!) GORGEOUS view of a cliff area that you'll never forget.- Ocean Sports Champagne Dinner Cruise- I can't recommend this one unless they offer boarding at \"A\" Bay (long Hawaiian name- they just call it \"A\" Bay for short). They hadn't notified the concierge desk at the Hilton that they board at some times of the year at a very industrial location 30 minutes north- NOT PRETTY. The food was okay, the open bar was all generic, but the crew was terrific. One of their tours apparently loads very close to the Hilton at A Bay, which would probably be great.- Legends of Hawaii Luau (right at the Hilton)- Everyone said you should go to a luau at least once and they were right. This was fun. Buffet food was okay, free drinks were beer, a couple generic \"white\" or \"red\" wines, or one of few frozen drinks. We paid extra to sit in the \"royalty\" section where you sit closer to the stage and have a waiter for each table to get drinks- this did save some walking and the location was good. Just open your mind when you walk in to learning a few things about Hawaii and seeing some darned good male dancers (the females were good, too, but the guys really had tough parts). Good fire handler, too. Shopping Access: There's a shuttle that picks up from the lower lobby to take you shopping ($2/adults, $1/kids, per ride). We didn't rent a car, so this was helpful. You can buy some very nice (and pretty cheap) t-shirts at the King's Marketplace. Crazy Shirts had high quality Ts, and the general store had cute, lesser quality, cheaper ones.A thought: We saved almost $300 total on the two tours and one luau we booked by agreeing to attend a timeshare presentation with Hilton Grand Vacations. We also got $200 in Hilton dollars that could be used toward the stay or a restaurant by doing this. You book a time for it through the concierge. It took us 2 hours and 15 minutes, start to finish. You have to be prepared to say no if no is the answer, but it wasn't too painful. It was hard to bypass the chance at $500 of savings just to listen (we said no).Note: The only beach at this resort is in the lagoon area. There's no open beach to the ocean. Great place nearby: There's a beach next door at the Marriott, and a GREAT beachy restaurant called Lava Lava Beach Club next to the Marriott. (We were tired of walking so we just got a cab at the main lobby to go over there ($10 min.) and got the guy's card to call him when we were going back. You could walk it, I think. This place is AWESOME- you sit right on the beach, there's music, the food was good... Our son loved walking around on the rocks in the water-lots of crabs scuttling around. I could live at this place. What we didn't like about this resort: We missed having a beach. There's open beach very close by at \"A\" Bay, though, so if you crave beach, you can get there. All in all, a lovely stay. ", " Been going (1-3) annually since 2001. Hotel views are spectacular, rooms immaculate, food exquisite, and the best employees of any hotel or resort I have ever visited. Valet and bell hops are the fastes ever. Timmy, Brian, and Brandon at the Kona Pool Bar are exceptional, they always remember returning guests nad makes you feel a part of the Waikoloa Ohana. ", " Our high school student group so appreciated the hospitality shown to us by the hotel and hope to visit again. This trip was a \"perk\" for our students who enjoyed the pool and facilities after their \"work\" (multiple music performances) was done.The hotel staff were helpful when they were asked, no matter what time it was. Compliments to the meal captains and servers, the front desk staff, and houskeeping staff who took care of our rooms and found lost items. Hotel worked w/us to stay within our budget inclusive of sleeping rooms, conference room and group meals. It's a big facility so plan accordingly for enough time to move from place to place and properly chaperone students. Queens Marketplace was within walking distance and added to activity options for our group.Kudos to Rachel, our Event Planner, who gave cheerful assistance throughout the entire process and made a huge difference in figuring out all the pesky details. Thank you, Rachel, for being so available and understanding of our needs -- you are a Gem! ", " The location, weather, makes a vacation away from it all so worth it. HILTON HOTEL was excellent. WE SO ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE!!!!Beautiful pools, walks along the beach,delicious food, friendly service, clean rooms makes the your whole vacation so restful and enjoyable. ", " Beautiful resort. Our stay in the Lagoon tower (room 4318) overlooking the dolphin pool and ocean was wonderful. It was like staying at Sea World! Enjoyed watching the sunset from our lanai as the dolphins frolicked below and the waves crashed into the lava shoreline. We snorkeled in the salt water lagoon and saw turtles, moray eels and many fish. The pool on the Lagoon side was great with a fun slide. My 21 second Go Pro video down the slide was a big hit with my grandson. The grounds were beautifully manicured with art and statuary everywhere. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Many thanks to Eric from KPC who ran a good ways to find us and return my husband's camera that we had left on the table. We would definitely return. ", " Every staff member was friendly and professional, starting with Megan, who checked us in and made sure that our stay was perfect. The grounds are breathtaking and there is plenty to do if you want to splurge, but our favorite thing was sit on our private terrace and watch the dolphins play. One activity not to miss is the Luau. Your fill of tasty food and drink and a truly spectacular show. Mahalo, Megan and the Hilton Waikoloa Village 'Ohana for making our 30th anniversary one we will never forget. ", " great experience at this hotel. staff was great and enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I attended for a conference. I liked the food and the hotel as a whole. the staff went above and beyond providing the best experience at the hotel. ", " My husband and I have stayed at this lovely resort many, many times and fall in love again each time we walk thru to lobby. The hotel, staff, restaurants and get a perfect 10. Be sure to check out KPC for dinner at sunset and save room for dessert. :-) ", " Sitting on our lanai and watching the surf crash against the volcanic rocks was enough to make this a paradise worth the trip, but there's so much more! We were only there for 4 days and wish we had planned better. 2 weeks would have been fantastic. Our grand kids had a blast enjoying swimming and snorkeling in the lagoons. Lots of fish to see. Swam with the dolphins. Food was great and not all that expensive. we will have a tough time outdoing this wonderful place for a marvelous family vacation. If there is a vote... we'll be back! ", " The moment you walk into this hotel and see the tram and gondola you know you're in for a real resort experience. The Hilton at Waikoloa has everything you need and more all in one place. We shared a double room in the Palace Tower which was extremely spacious, with a walk in wardrobe, balcony and two double beds. There are a number of restaurants on the grounds however a short $2 shuttle to the King or Queen shops (10- 15 minutes walk) leads to you other establishments. My friends and I travelled in May 2014 and stayed for 4 nights. The grounds weren't as busy as during peak season. This was a welcome relief as we all wanted to relax therefore the pool beds and chairs were easy to come by. I would recommend this as an ideal time to spend time at the hotel, the weather was hot and you won't feel crowded. Big mention to Cole at the Dolphin experience. He was extremely friendly, approachable and showed a genuine care for the well being and nurturing of the dolphins at home in the resort. He was happy to answer any questions and really lets us up close and personal with the dolphins during our experience. The cost is pricy however well worth it as the dolphins are used to people and extremely beautiful. the service overall was great, my TV remote broke and within minutes an engineer was at my room to fix the issue. Overall a hotel that breeds its own dolphins, has a gondola and breathtaking grounds and views is nothing but impressive. Would return here in a heart beat! ", " This was my 1st Hawaii trip and my fianc\u00e9's second, and we loved it so much that we'll be returning in the Fall of 2014 to hold our wedding on the grounds next to the bay. The accommodations were awesome; Ocean Tower partial ocean view room was clean and king bed and pillows were comfy. Supplied shampoo/conditioner/soap are from Kohala Spa and good quality. All members of the staff were very friendly and helpful, and housekeeping did an awesome job even with special requests. :)The resort complex is HUGE, so unless you don't mind either getting some exercise or taking the Tram or canal boat, you should probably choose to stay in the Lagoon Tower. There are little shops in every Tower which are great for reasonably-priced unique souvenirs. If you need food or drinks onsite, you'll pay for it; ~$3 for a small Gatorade, ~$5 quart of milk, etc. If you're on a budget, take a shuttle to the Queen's Marketplace and stock up, but remember you only have a small fridge....LOL.Hotel-supplied in-room coffee was weak and you'll pay Starbucks-like prices for a bit for a slightly more caffeinated version at Waikoloa Coffee Company. My Tip: If you drink coffee for flavor and not caffeine, you'll be fine, but if you need a jolt to get going, pick up some of the small basket-style coffee packs of your fave coffee brand and use those. Onsite coffee is great, just not much caffeine for the buck. :(We really enjoyed having high-speed internet (both wired & wireless) in the room as well at the big LCD TV with Blu-ray - and with a free 'Redbox-style' movie rental kiosks.Onsite restaurants are pricey but well worth it on the quality. Portions are large, so ask for a 2nd plate and do the take-out option to go back to your room and share. I felt The Big Island Breakfast was overpriced at first, I mean who the heck can eat $29.95 worth food for breakfast, Godzilla?? No worries though, my fianc\u00e9' and I had the breakfast and quickly discovered that you can have just about ANYTHING and as much as you can put down for that price. If you look at the pricing as being about eating ANYTHING and AS MUCH as you can eat, it's a fair price. Breakfast service staff were very efficient and friendly.The Hilton Waikoloa Village is definitely going to be one of my favorite annual vacation stops from here forward! You just can't beat it for a total relaxation destination. :) ", " This beautiful, scenic Hotel provided quiet rest at night and a lot of wonderful daily activities. It was practically perfect. Downside: $17/day parking; Valet attendants becoming petulant when not used during rainy drop off or checkout. ", " This resort offered a chance to relax in many ways. The Big Breakfast Buffet was good as was the Chinese Restaurant. The resort uses a tram to get you around and it is needed. There are 1100 rooms with three different towers. Not on the beach but a man-made lagoon provides sea water.We rented a car and drove the island. Be sure to do that to enjoy the Big Island. You will never forget this resort.The coco-mango soap was so good that we bought some to bring home! Be sure to get the ear plugs as the birds outside will start singing around 5 AM. ", " I stay at various Hilton properties across the USA about 40-50 times per year. Of course that means that I am familiar with all things Hilton and have just learned to ask the \u201cright questions\u201d when I want/need something specific and smile and nod when someone says \u201cThank you for being a Diamond Member\u201d. It\u2019s all fairly routine and I have always been treated VERY well no matter if it\u2019s a Hampton Inn in some little town or a Hilton in a big city. All of those expectations we shattered during my stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! Starting from the very moment I arrived, absolutely every employee I came in contact with was the most pleasant and friendly person you could ever hope for. Nobody knew what my Hilton status was and nobody needed to know, they just wanted my stay at this property to be the best that it possibly could be, no matter what. After checking in and hearing the front desk clerk tell me about the property (with the obligatory \u201c\u2026.and thank you for being a Diamond Member), I sat down on one of the benches and watched a few other people check in and NOTHING was different\u2026..in a good way. Everybody gets treated like royalty here! It just came across as the way they do things here. Of course it could be easy to say something like, \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a beautiful resort in a tropical paradise, they SHOULD be happy\u201d. It\u2019s just not that simple though. I have no doubt that it\u2019s \u201cjust a job\u201d to a lot of people there, but the key is: they don\u2019t show it. Literally, every single employee we encountered was happy and cordial and interested in making sure our stay was great. Example: we bumped into a maintenance guy who was repairing drywall and painting one of the guest rooms in the Ocean Tower. He struck up a conversation with us and 10 minutes later he\u2019s telling us about some great places to go and sight see or some local dive that has the best fish tacos on earth. It just felt like he wanted our trip to be a little bit better and that was his way making that happen. He could have just as easily said \u201cAloha\u201d and we\u2019d all be on our way for the day, but instead, we got to east the best fish taco\u2019s on earth. I give you every assurance that if it had been any other Hilton, there is no way that would have happened.I really can\u2019t say enough good things about this resort. In general, if you don\u2019t like resort life, you are probably not going to like it. It\u2019s a big, BIG sprawling property (just like you have read about in other reviews here) and waiting for the tram or a boat can be somewhat cumbersome, but walking was an option that we exercised (no pun intended) on a regular basis and is worth it just for the artwork. If you ARE used to resort life AND you accept the fact that it was built in the early 80\u2019s and SOME things are a tad dated, this place is hard to beat in terms of what it offers and the unbelievable staff. Should you choose to escape the confines of their walls, their location is very convenient to bask in the glory of some beautiful white sand beaches that live just to the North (Hapuna, Mauna Kea, etc). While I am sure the fine folks at the Hilton would prefer you stayed, I HIGHLY suggest you make the (very) short trip to check them out.I have to give special recognition to Vanessa and Ululani at the breakfast buffet. We ate breakfast there every day and these two ladies changed the course of our vacation in such a positive way that \u201cThank You\u201d is not big enough. They stood out as brilliant jewels of the property and that is quite a feat when you consider how brilliant everyone else shines. Thanks again and I assure you, we will be back! ", " We honeymooned at the Hilton Waikoloa Village (King's Land--which allows access to the Hilton Waikoloa Village) in October 2013. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.The staff and service were incredible, as was the location. Within the village is a grocery store, which was great for saving on snacks and beverages. The pool was always quiet and we never had to fight to get a chair. The sunset from the rocks is unbelievable and the lagoon is great for snorkeling. We were so relaxed by the end of our stay and cannot wait to go back! ", " the hotel property is ideal, a lush tropical oasis on the Big Island. the staff is friendly and helpful. we had a complaint about the smell in the room and we were moved to another room, no questions asked, within 20 minutes of the 1st phone call. the property is highly recommended both for location and service. ", " Totally beautiful resort! It is massive but we found that walking around rather than using the shuttle or the boat you really get to see everything properly, and once you get to know your way around it really doesn't seem so big! The place is like a museum so many pieces of art and sculpture all set in wonderfully kept grounds... Very helpful and friendly staff made our stay comfortable and memorable.The food on site can be a bit pricey but Kings and Queens shops are just a shuttle ride away and a bit more reasonable, saying that Donna & Tonys pizza in the resort are really good and not expensive!The resort it quite a long way from everything but most of the tours pick up. The pools are amazing and there are sea turtles swimming in the lagoon! A really well kept and well appointed resort ! ", " This is an outstanding facility with many unexpected extra amenities--well worth another visit. Hilton has effected a beautiful transformation of a lava field into a first class resort. We were there as a couple, but there were many families with all aged children who were very well entertained with several pools and also a salt water lagoon with tropical fish, snorkeling gear, kayaks, etc. Altogether, it was a happy, relaxing vacation. ", " This is my 3rd time coming back to Hilton Waikoloa Village. And everytime, we were so excited to look forward to go back, and so happy that we did, and enjoyed every moment we spent in the hotel from riding the tram, boat between towers, snorkeling at the Lagoon, swimming with Dolphin, having our usual favorite buffet breakfast in the morning, dinning at different restaurants. More importantly, the view from our room in Ocean Tower is wordless... Just enjoying the most beautiful sunset right from our balcony every night and listening to the ocean in the morning with birds signing. ", " I give this Hotel a 101% rating. I enjoyed the property and the hotel workers. My husband and I stayed there because of HGEA 22nd Biennial General Assembly. I even got to extend my stay after the General Assembly, so that I can enjoy the property. The pools were awesome, the food was great during General Assembly. I would love to go back to Hilton Waikoloa for General Assembly again. ", " Wonderful experience at the Hilton Waikoloa. Can't wait to go again. Everybody should experience this hotel at least once, I'm sure you'll be back for more. Lots of interesting features to enjoy. This is the best hotel for a getaway and real relaxation. ", " The resort was huge and outstanding. We stayed 1 night at Hilton Waikoloa Village. The village includes a lot of activities and shops inside, so we can stay whole day long at the village without getting tired of it. The staff is attentive and friendly. What I like the most is Gorgeous View of sunrise and sunset from private beach. ", " This was a very nice place to stay. We enjoyed much of what the resort had to offer. Normally we are out and about SCUBA diving and other activities but the resort was nice enough that we spent more time at the resort than we normally do. ", " This hotel is set in such an idyllic setting lots of beaches with great ocean pools, many pools and a train running through the lobby to take you to your room. What more. Could you ask for ? Three towers of rooms spread apart so you don't feel like there are too many people at the resort ", " After spending 12 days at this resort in the Makai tower, we really didn't want to go home! We had a great trip and really enjoyed all of the amenities that the resort offered. The staff was outstanding. This was our 10th trip to Hawaii and honestly, it was most likely one of the best. We will be back! I am a Hilton Diamond member and stay at a lot of hotels. This is a great place and I highly recommend it. ", " We spent a week at Hilton Waikoloa Village, on The Big Island, in March. Our condo was lovely, and although there were a couple very minor maintenance issues, they were fixed immediately. The staff was gracious and extremely friendly. The concierge was quite helpful. We would definitely go back there. One thing we did not realize until we got there is that we really needed a car. There are no restaurants on the property; nor is there a market of any kind. The shopping area is too far to walk if you are carrying back a lot of groceries. The hotel does provide shuttle service though. So if you are not planning on any sight-seeing, you can manage without a car. ", " The Staff are friendly and helpful. The front lobby has icewater laced with fruits available all hours of the day if you are thirsty, and it is a great place to parrot watch or people watch while waiting for your transportation to arrive. The Tram runs all day, the boat just the afternoons, but because the property is so large, a great option for those who are unable to walk everywhere. My only complaint is with our pillows....They were way too soft. ", " Our children had a great time with the dolphins, the turtles, the slides and one very respectful and fun life guard named Kelson. The boat and train and multiple pools as well as the golf courses are fun for the adults too.Bring the family and enjoy. ", " Out of our two weeks traveling through the Hawaii Islands, our parents enjoyed the Waikoloa Hilton the most. We will definitely be returning. The staff was accommodating and gracious. We were allowed to checkin early and checkout late, which gave us time to explore the beautiful grounds. ", " Had some initial problems (that can happen), but Hilton Waikoloa eventually made it right -- in fact, more than right! Room problems on second night ended up with a beautiful suite for the last three nights. ", " My family went here for the first time and it was awesome! We stayed here from June 3,2013 to June 11,2013 we all loved it! \u2764\ufe0f they have a place where you can swim with dolphins but you have to pay in advance and book it, they have a lagoon where you can rent paddle boards, canoes, paddle boats, snorkeling equipment, and other things! They have turtles and fish in the lagoon also! They have a huge checker board by the main pool and a bar and a snack area over there also and a slide! The Luau is awesome! We were front row and it was just terrific! They have other pools to but theyre kind of small. The hotel has a Japanese steak house habachi restaraunt, a Mexican one where a boat and take you too, they have an Italian restaraunt to thats good where you can sit outside by the water and watch the boats go by! My family and I went to Toni's witch is the Italian place the first day we got there and the last day we got there! The hotel is 66 ACRES!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have boat transportation, a monorail, and walking! They also have a little breakfast shop thing where you can get muffins and things like that! And if course they have a store where you can buy toothbrushes, sun tan lotion, suviners, and snacks and things like that!! It was one of my favorite vacation! It was a family one with 2 girls ages 12 and 11 and then my husband and I. The only bad thing is... Its pricey. We also stayed in the Palace tower on the 5th floor and on the balcony there were cats and mongooses, and we fed them pizza off the balcony and the cats always came back for more it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a fabulous hotel on the Big Isle. So relaxing and peaceful -- the grounds are fantastic to walk day and night - paradise setting!Entire staff is also great and always there to help out -- special thanks to Raquel Feliciano and Westley Martinez (concierges) for helping us with dinner reservations, hotel information, and general island knowledge. They were always there to assist and this helped out our Big Isle adventure enormously with the paradise stay at the Hilton. A+++ ", " One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in, we were given a upgrade to Ocean Front and the view was fantastic. Lagoon View rooms are great. Hawaiian Warrior torch run each night was very interesting and impressive to watch. ", " Stayed here last year with grandchildren and last week with our friends; both experiences were outstanding from the services upon check-in to our daily interactions with staff throughout the property. We usually do not eat at a hotel, but breakfast at the coffee shop was great and dinner in the bars were terrific! ", " I stayed for 7 nights at the end of April with the 7th night free and a free luau ticket. The hotel is huge and it can be a walk to the rooms but I found with the settings and the beautiful artwork along the walkways the distances passed quickly. I had room 7028 on the Ocean Tower overlooking the golf course and had a partial ocean view. The room was very good ,well maintained with lots of storage space, a small fridge that was good enough for my needs and good tv. You could hear the birds in the early morning but they were not too bad.I bought the dining card for $30 which gave you 2 $10 coupons and 10% off food and beverage for a week.The breakfast buffet at the Water's edge was excellent and the staff recognised me from my previous visit.There is a laundrette ( one in the ocean tower which was very handy)The pools are large with lots of seating and tended to be busier at weekends.The restaurants were good with the Chinese restaurant , Kirin being good value for money with large portions.There is a shuttle bus to the Queens Marketplace and Kings Shops ( every 20 mins) which have more restaurants and a grocery store for water/soda etc. There is also a trail to Hawaiian petroglyphs which was interesting.You can hire a snorkelling kit in the lagoon which is worth while as I saw 6 sea turtles all close beside me.Housekeeping was very good.As a Hilton Hhonors member I got an invitation to a reception on Thursday but I could not make it as I was on an all day tour to Volcano National Park but I appreciated the invitation.The fitness centre in the Lagoon tower was very good and well equipped.The art work and landscaping in the hotel is amazing and it is the most scenic hotel that I have been to.Buddha point is a good point to see the sunset ( I saw two of the \" green flashes\" at sunset) and the black lava rocks and blue ocean make for great photos. There is a footpath past Buddha point which offers views of the ocean coming into a small cove.The luau was good with a good show and buffet.All the staff were nice and friendlyThis is one of the best hotels that I have stayed at and the landscaping is fantastic. The size of the resort may not be for everyone but I had no problems and it was excellent value for money. It was a shame to leave the hotel and I look forward to coming back. ", " One of the nicest hotels we have stayed at. Very scenic and beautiful. Just the right amount of activities and quiet, relaxing time. Not a good place for people who are always in a hurry or with an impatient nature though. It was very enjoyable to take either the tram or the boat to our building, however, it could be walked faster. One of the highlights was the day some whales decided to play in the ocean right off the resort. We were able to watch them from our balcony for quite a while. ", " We just completed a 12 day stay. everything was great. The staff are all friendly and the grounds are beautiful and well-kept. This was our 4th stay at t his property and we will definitely return. It's a great property for anyone with children because of the pools, water slides and salt-water lagoon (with lots of sea turtles). ", " For a classic Hawaiian hotel the HWV is top of it's class. This expansive resort is designed for the traveler to be self contained with tons of activities and facilities to keep a couple or family busy and entertained.First thing to know; it is roughly a 1/4 mile walk from the Lobby to the Ocean Tower, so plan accordingly by not being in a hurry. The resort offers two forms of transportation a modern tram or boat ride to all the places you want to go.  Upon check in, ask for as many towel cards you will need you get beach towels at any of the pools but you must return all towels in order not to be charged. Once you have your towels, you can go for a swim in a sea fed lagoon, or pool. An Adult only pool is by the Ocean tower. After swimming all day, head by the dolphin experience to see the dolphins at play. Then go to one of the many expansive lawns near the water as a traditionally hawaiian warrior comes at sundown to light each torch. Then for dinner try either the Ibana Japanese Food (reservations available on Open Table) or Kirin Chinese. Or take the boat over to the Ocean tower and have a meal and mai tai at the boat cantina.If you do want to leave the resort, just plan on time. Just leave the fast pace life behind. ", " My experience at this resort in three words would have to be: Heaven on Earth! The friendly staff and pristine ocean views make for a great getaway setting. We found the decorations to be like a museum! The waterslides brought out the kids in us, and the hot tubs with the powerful jets were so relaxing! The beds were like sleeping on clouds, and the black out curtains allowed us to sleep in! Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying on the Big Island! ", " We stayed in one of the Lagoon towers directly over the dolphin lagoon for 3 nights. It was an absolutely beautiful view and very pleasant to be able to pop out on the lanai and watch the dolphins at any point. As many people will point out, it is a rather large property, so getting places can take time but the train and/or boat at least makes it a little more enjoyable, but if you're on vacation, what's your hurry? We visited a couple of the restaurants on site had good meals at both and the long walk back to the room was actually nice after a filling meal. We had drinks by the dolphin lagoon and a bird pooped in my drink, we (myself, wife, and staff) had a good laugh and they replaced it quickly.The lagoon for guests is a great bonus, but do be careful about stepping on rocks/coral while in it, as I got a decent sized gash in my foot while treading water. However, it's connected to the ocean, so there is wildlife in the water and a nice place to practice snorkelling before going out to look for turtles. Staff were all lovely, happy, and very helpful. We had an incredible stay here. The standard rooms seemed a bit more out of the way, so I'm sure this sized property is not for everyone. Very well maintained, clean rooms and general areas. Lots to do on site, pools, animals, spa, gym, restaurants, etc. I'd gladly stay again. ", " The resort was beautiful and well maintained. It is sprawling and takes time to get from point A to B. Beautiful artifacts all around the property and great photo opportunities. Check out the golf course area at sunset. Our ocean view room (6084) in the Ocean Tower was very quiet and the view was great. Unfortunately, we had to go to the other side (Lagoon Area) to use the hot tub but there were pools near our room. ", " We arrived at the Hilton Waikoloa resort after spending seven days in a beautiful house with pool in south Kona, candidly I did not want to leave the house as I am not a resort type person. As we drove in, the property is simply beautiful. Just like a resort should be.....To my very pleasant surprise from the moment we arrived the Hilton the staff were awesome!! Eric at the front desk was patient with all my questions and assisting with our room upgrade, explained everything without being overly sales oriented. (Buy the discount card!) Once checked-in we proceeded to our room in the Palace Tower. Our luggage was already in the room with the bellman standing by to answer any questions.Granted the place is huge, but the Museum Walk is so interesting with new details each time. If you do not want to walk they have a tram and boats for you. Remember, when here you are on vacation/conference and things take a little more time. As for the nature sounds, they were really nice throughout not bothersome at all. We live full time in the Appalachian mountains of Georgia, very remote and very quiet therefore wee are extra sensitive to extraneous noise, but no worries here.The Chinese restauarant, Kirin was quite good and I am a very particular \"foodie\" due to my travels. (Will review seperately) In addition, the beach side restaurant was really good. Vanessa was the BEST beach host, always attentive and there when you needed something (Blueberry Mojito, oh yes) Tuna burger....I could eat one right now.The folks at the beach rental hut were INCREDIBLY nice and helpful. Kau, TJ, John and the rest were so pleasant and kind to our 9 yo daughter, they remembered my name each and every time making for a much more personal experience than one would expect at a resort. We rented paddle boards, peddle bikes, snorkel guy...the whole enchilada and everytime we have excellent service from this team. It made the cost of the rentals much easier to handle!Also, as a parent this team made us feel very comfortable giving our daughter a little more latitude in how far she could explore on her on. Not free rein but .....I could really go on and on about the positive experiences we had at this Hilton Waikoloa, even though I did not want to stay there. This hotel and the staff are great, well trained and extremely attentive to their guests needs.To the entire staff, thank for a great final week on the Big Island! We will definately be back! ", " A great place to stay whether you are solo, on business, or for a family vacation. Meeting rooms, guest rooms, restaurants, fitness, or relaxation needs will be met here. If you have not seen Hawaii, start here. ", " We only stayed 3 nights in this resort and I really wished that it was for longer! We stayed in one of the rooms at Ocean Towers (room 3091 and 3092). We had two adjoining rooms for our family of four and we were well acommodated for! Such a lot to see and do on this Island - hop onto the island shopping trolley to head on out to the Kings and Queens shopping malls, take a resort tram or boat to one of the many restaurants, activities, sights within the resort itself. I reiterate other great comments about this resort and the \"Big\" Island - its well worth staying here for at least a week, whether you are a couple or a family.I am definately going back! ", " Our rooms were average roomsThe view was greatThe meals are budget breakersRent a car before you get here cuz you'll be up to $100 for a runt of a car. . Much less a jeep. We paid about $500 for 3 days of jeep. DON'T WAIT TILL YOU GET HERE TO RENT A CAR. THERE is a car place at Kona airport whet you can get your pre rental. The cost of a cab for the dirty drive to airport. .70 bucks. There is a rental place at hilton but you better have a big wallet. The hilton is nice. Area is ugly with nothing but lava. . No real sandy beaches except one about ten miles north. .. that's kind of ok. Buffett breakfast is $3o per person.  MacDonalds..Wal-Mart by airport. Dive the big island. . Enjoy the drive across mountains. beautiful. Prices for motels much cheaper on opposite side of island and much greener. ", " The resort was wonderful for our family stay. The kids had a great time at the pool and snorkeling at the lagoon. Kids loved the Dolphin experience as well. Bring your own sunscreen and small groceries because if you buy it there it will cost you double. ", " Such a great resort! It is absolutely massive, but provides train services to get to the many rooms, facilities, restaurants, shops and pools. They arrange external charters and activities, and have dolphins, waterslides, a little church, and just about everything really! Because it's so big, don't underestimate the time it will take to get to the exit. ", " We have stayed here several times and have never been disappointed. This last time we splurged for a suite and it was worth it. Spacious living area. Walk in door less shower. Huge bath tub. Separate sinks in separate parts of the bathroom. Upgraded bath products. Bath robes. Mini matter which rooms we stay in they are always very clean. Great staff. Great food. Lots for everyone to do. Love the breakfast buffet. Beautiful property. We didn't want to leave. ", " We stayed at this hotel as part of a 40th wedding anniversary trip. I had booked the presidential suite for the week and arragned a vow renewal ceremony at Buddha point through the hotel staff. Overall, the experience was excellent. I had no issues making my reservations and getting exactly the room that I wanted for the week. The room was excellent with a large dining table, two bedrooms, and a large lanai. The staff was very attentive and responded to our requests very quickly.The facility is very large (64 acres) so be prepared to do a lot of walking. We have a handicapped daughter in a wheelchair and while almost everything is accessible, it may not be a direct route to it for a wheelchair. The tram was handicapped accessible and the staff was very responsive to our needs in this regard.I worked with the catering group to set up our vow renewal at Buddha Point followed by a sunset dinner at the point. The person that I worked with was understanding of my desires for the ceremony and was helpful without being intrusive. She made recommendations for a minister for ceremony and for a photographer. All in all, it was a very special ceremony for me and my wife.I would strongly recommend that you rent a car (National Car Rental on site) and do a couple of day trips. The black sand beach at Pahala and Volcano National Park are worth the drive.All in all, this was a very special trip that was made better by an attentive staff and wonderful facility. ", " What a great place to stay. My family of 6 were busy till exhaustion. The grounds are incredible, pools wonderful, and the lagoon a educational & safe place for younger kids. This is both a romantic spot for the adults, and a tropical playground for the kids. Wonderful vacation ", " This is a fabulous hotel particularly traveling with children.Even if you don't stay here visiting the grounds of this property is well worth the trip. The attention to detail sets this property above many.The service is also fabulous. We experienced challenges with the wi-fi and immediately they sent a very friendly technician to set up a special modem. The Big Island Breakfast Buffet is a must and a highlight. ", " My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed here for a long weekend while visiting Hawaii. We loved it! Great rooms, great views, atmosphere was wonderful, staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was so wonderful and the bed was amazingly comfortable!! We would definitely go back! :) ", " Outstanding resort - everything is here. There is a Disney-like atmosphere - tram, boat, animals, art. Beautiful grounds, pools. Food is expensive, but you can take a trolley for $2 to a very close mini-mall that has other food options. ", " Awesome hotel! Large property beautiful landscape. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with a large balcony patio, great views. Shuttle service to the market area was very helpful. You could buy just about anything you could want and take back to your room, food, snacks, any liquor and soft drinks also. Koan coast is just beautiful. Highly recommend this resort. ", " My husband , 7 year old daughter and I, stayed for a week in August 2013. Truly the most fantastic, fun and beautiful resort. Everyday is an adventure, snorkelling in the lagoon, swimming in the pool, fab pool slides, bird watching, shows, food, boat rides, train rides, incredible sculptures and art and of course great staff and gorgeous weather. Even better than all of this, is the dolphin quest. This experience is the most informative and fun encounter with dolphins you will ever have, Theses dolphins are loved and cared for and are extremely happy in this environment. This is paradise!!! Although you don't want to leave the resort, the big island is the most amazing place to explore, from incredible snorkelling to beautiful bush, flowers, birds, restaurants, shops, the people here are the most welcoming and laid back. Holidaying with children, feeling safe is a must, and the big Island is one of the most safest places we have visited in the world. Don't hesitate, just do it!!! ", " My wife and I stayed here for a week, and had a wonderful time. The room is spacious, and comes with a mini-fridge (we used this a lot in an effort to save a little money given how sky-high prices are for dining out in Hawaii). The balcony was just the right size, and had a reasonably nice panoramic view of the property and the ocean.The on-property restaurants we ate at were all good-- standing out were the lobster burger at the Lagoon Grill and the vanilla ice cream at Shaka's Cones (the best vanilla ice cream my wife and I have ever had!). Be warned, though, that dining here is quite a bit more expensive than we're used to in the continental U.S. Including snacks, a few drinks (I don't drink, but my wife averaged around 5 Rum&Coke's per day), and the occasional \"luxury\" restaurant (sunset beachside dinner at Kamuela Provision Company and sushi dinner at Imari), we averaged around $300 per day for both of us during our stay (and we generally ate very light breakfasts or skipped it altogether).The tram and boat service to take you around the property are nice, though the property's small enough that walking it end-to-end only takes about 20 minutes-- in some cases, walking is significantly faster than taking the tram or boat. Definitely take the time for a boat ride from one end of the property to the other after dark-- the starscape is beautiful without the light pollution that most of us are used to!The pools are plentiful, and the artificial waterfall and waterslide are both fun and obviously kid-friendly. Poolside drink service, though, is definitely of the \"island-time\" variety, to be generous in describing how slow it can be.The natural lagoon is wonderful, with a variety of watersports available (again, at a significant cost, though). It was fun to watch the adults and kids playing with the dolphins in the dolphin cove, and my wife and I were tempted to repeat our dolphin excursion from the Bahamas a few years back, until we saw the prices-- roughly double what we paid through the cruse ship. Nonetheless, this was obviously a longer and more kid-friendly interaction than we'd had before, so we're looking forward to coming back with our daughter and paying for it as a family anyway.I recommend sitting through the Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare presentation-- it was not high-pressure, and gets you some significant discounts and coupons to use during your stay.A few nits to pick, in all honesty:The king-size bed, though clean, was a bit on the firm side for our comfort. However, this is probably more an issue of personal preference than anything else.The bathroom itself was surprisingly cramped, and we were disappointed to find a tub/shower combination when most of the better hotels have spacious shower stalls instead.No complimentary in-room wifi?!? Seems kind of cheap to charge separately for it in this day and age. However, not a severe issue given the number of free wifi hotspots available in the various lounges scattered throughout the property.Overall, a great experience, and one we're looking forward to repeating the next time we vacation in Hawaii-- only we'll bring our daughter with us to take advantage of the kid-friendly stuff! ", " The weather was absolutely perfect. 85 degrees everyday with no rain. The evenings were pleasant with a warm breeze coming off the Pacific Ocean and that was just the part that the Hilton could not control. This is one of the most beautiful properties that I have ever seen and the staff is very polite, professional and helpful. We arrived late at night due to a flight delay, but check in was easy and we were in our room within 20 minutes of arrival. Our room was of the basic configuration variety as opposed to a larger room or suite. It could best be described as a standard room. It also had a sofa bed which could accommodate two more guests and I believe it was intended for a family with children. There was a small porch that overlooked the resort golf course and when the door was open in the evening the breeze off the ocean was a pleasant relief from the air conditioning. We are retired and enjoy a laid back atmosphere which this property amply provided. There are a lot of activities for children and it was fun just watching them swim in the multiple pools and the lagoon that had sea turtles swimming with the guests. Various ages interacted well even though they did not always appear to be members of the same family. The only negative that we encountered was in the evening when a group of young people who had the room next to us came in and were quite vulgar and rowdy. A call to security solved that problem fairly quickly and the rest of the evening was quiet and peaceful. This property has several pools, the aforementioned lagoon, views of the ocean, several swimming pools, a people moving system that utilizes both trains and boats. The boats run from 2PM until midnight and the trains run 24/7. For shoppers there are two small malls within walking distance and they contain food markets that are fairly reasonable in terms of pricing. I say this because as with most resorts the cost of items on property are much higher than in a business off site. This is not a resort for a family on a tight budget as it is quite pricy, but experience has taught me that you get what you pay for and this is a wonderful place. I would definitely stay here again. For those who like to remain fit while on vacation there is a fitness center, walking paths, Yoga classes and the swimming pools. The spa seemed very popular and was praised by others in our group that utilized the service. As an aside, we flew American Airlines and we were delayed five hours going and ten hours returning which resulted in a 24 hour day going and 29 coming home. We lost two days as a result due to jet lag and fatigue. This was only offset by the beauty and tranquility of Waikoloa. Once again , it is a wonderful place, a little pricy but the staff treats you well and makes you feel like a welcome guest which makes for a wonderful destination. The Concierge service was also very good and helped immensely with side trips and tours both on the Big Island as well as the other islands in the Hawiian chain. Aloha! ", " This was our first time visiting the Big Island. We visited Maui and Kaui in the past. This resort is absolutely gorgeous. Stunning views, well cared for landscapes. The only negative thing here were the rooms. We found them a bit tired and in need of a reno. When booking this property keep in mind that its 60acres. There's a lot of walking. I'm not sure if I would be too pleased if I had young children in a stroller. ", " My wife, colleagues and I were brought here by our wonderful company for our annual sales convention. The meals were good, the pools and Jacuzzi's are fun and spacious. Our room is nice in the \"Ocean Tower\". A nice view with gorgeous ocean views of the mountains and surrounding landscape is available from several points on the resort. Amazingly, in spite of the lack of sand-filled ocean beaches, they do have a sufficient lagoon beach area with sand and play areas for children. Overall, we are satisfied with everything. ", " My husband and I like jaw-dropping unique resort hotels and this definitely fits that criteria. After check in we were directed to our building which was accessed by either boat or tram. We had upgraded our room (at a reasonable surcharge) to ocean view and yes--theoretically we did have an ocean view--but it was of the lagoon that was fed from the ocean--there were no waves. Nevertheless it was incredibly beautiful. We spent 2 nights on the Big Island at this resort and traveled to Hilo to see Volcanoes National Park --I mention this because it's a over 2-3 hour drive on a road with hairpin turns (unless you want to take Saddle Road over the mountains--which we didn't want to do in the dark). Our room was a huge room with a King size bed--clean & modern. The only downside to staying at this resort (probably the same at all resorts in this area) are the loud birds that start tweeing at 4AM. It woke us up -- there are free ear plugs available from the front desk. The only restuarant we went to in the resort was the Italian--it was OK--a bit overpriced and the food was just average--but the ambiance was very nice. There was so much to do at this resort that we would have loved to stay longer. I absolutely loved the lagoon--this was a salt water lagoon fed from the ocean with only a weak current. I felt very safe snorkeling there and saw an incredible number of brightly colored fish--also got several feet away from a huge sea turtle who just ignored me. Other activities available were: snuba, surf board paddling, snorkel lessons/tours, kayaking, swimming with the dolphins--the list was endless. They don't have a traditional beach--lava up to the water's edge is normal for this area. So what they did was build the lagoon and imported sand --which is a great alternative to the traditional sandy beach. There was an extra charge for many of the activities if you didn't have your own equipment and there was a charge for parking--but this isn't unexpected at this type of resort. Loved all the statues & artwork at the resort--hope I can come back in the future! ", " My husband and I came for our 25th wedding anniversary. My husband is a Hilton's Honor member so they waived our resort fee and gave us a $100 in food vouchers. Overall the grounds are beautiful! You can walk the perimeter of the entire complexion in about 20 minutes. There is a walking path that takes you to the public beach and it is about a 10 minute walk. The views and sunsets are just gorgeous!!!! There are nice shops right outside the complex and within walkin distance. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower. It is close to the lobby, shopping and the biggest pool. Our room was spacious and looked newly renovated. My only complaint was the towels were as rough as sand paper and we're not very nice. This is the tower to be if you like to be close to the action and people watch. The ocean tower looked very nice, but the pool mostly was in the shade and not many areas to sit. However, it looked very quiet. This is the tower to stay if you like a more tranquil setting. The palace tower was my least favorite tower. It sits back a little bit and it looked a little more run down. The restaurants are just typical hotel restaurants. Not many choices for breakfast just a buffet and a Starbucks type place with muffins. We ate at the KPC for our anniversary dinner. We wanted to eat outside but it was too windy and wet so they gave us a free dessert. This is a fine dining restaurant with a fine dining cost. There is a great place called Lava Lava Beach Club which is a couple minutes away by the Marriott. It is a restaurant that sits right on the beach with a beautiful view . Family friendly and great views!! Overall this hotel is a great place to stay! ", " This was our first visit to the Big Island and driving past lava fields made us wonder what we would find. But the property is lush and beautifully landscaped with a treasure trove of antique and reproduction museum figures from all over Asia. We stayed in Palace Tower. Great service, good view, very comfortable. Loved the pools and walkways. Excellent staff. Good food just expensive. Fabulous sunset views and kpc restaurant is exquisite. Didn't mind the walking--it is so gorgeous and a feast for the eyes while getting a bit of exercise. Wonderful attention to details and helpful concierge. A-Bay is right next door with a good beach option. Sunny weather was a treat! Really hope to return here. ", " Excellent hotel in all regards, we really enjoyed our stay. Very clean and immaculate property - gorgeous artworks and fabulous rooms. Would recommend to anyone traveling to the Big Island! Extremely nice transport facilities in between the sectors of the hotel, either via tram or via boat --- beautiful property! ", " We stayed for a week in March, 2014, and was every disappointed when we had to leave. I loved, loved, loved this place. We have stayed at many different resorts on all of the Hawaiian islands, and this one is definitely on the top of the list of favorites. The grounds are gorgeous and have statues everywhere so you actually feel like you are in paradise. The resort is very, very large and we were in the ocean tower so we had a good jaunt to our room, but the walk was good and enjoyable. We rode the tram only a few times during our week stay. The boat rides were so calming and relaxing, we would just get on and ride through the resort and enjoy the scenery. I would go back to this place and would highly recommend it. I only hope and pray that I will get the opportunity to visit again because it was on a scale of 1 to 10 a 10 by far. ", " This is a great vacation destination if you are looking to stay at a resort where everything is available and you can relax without having to drive around. The gardens are lovely for walking around and they have an ocean lagoon and several pools. The rooms are far from the reception but they have a train and boat that can take you. Everything is very well maintained and cared for. The size of the resort means it does not seem crowded however the lagoon can get a little busy with kayaks, paddle boards and swimmers. If you come to the Big island to experience Hawaii away from the crowds then this is not the place for you. If you want to relax and stay at a beautiful location then this is an ideal place. ", " This family resort is located in Big Island. It is on the beach with lots of amenities for kids and family. They have a monorail as well as a boat for travel within the resort. With many pools (including an adult pool), paddle boating, sandy beach area as well as dolphin training, and many restaurants one could just stay in the resort the whole time. The rooms are not the best that we have stayed in but we did not stay in our room as much with so much to do in the resort and on the island. ", " We are still here and loving every minute!The first night we stayed in a suite in the Lagoon Tower and it was a beautiful room, newly refurbished.The rest of the stay we spent in the Presidential Suite in the Palace Tower. The room is very large and wonderful for a family. I really wish all resort rooms were like this, extremely spacious. I did request the Lagoon Tower Presidential Suite 6 months in advance and did not receive it. We are celebrating our 25 yr. wedding anniversary and my 50th birthday.I was a little let down when I discovered we did not receive this tower, but the room size is wonderful (almost 4,000 sq. ft.).The kitchen...kitchenette was extremely small but worked to store our cold food In our mini fridge. I was told before check in that we would have a cooktop, there is not one. The kitchen has a mini fridge, microwave, coffee pot and a sink only. Which means cooking any food is out of the question.The staff was very accommodating and nice. Expect to walk a lot, I love it but it would be tough for those with small children.I will attach photos to this review later as we are still on site and really enjoying the Aloha spirit!!! ", " We spent eight nights in March. This was a return trip for us with our two girls. Our memories from 2003 were enhanced. The resort itself is first class. We stayed in the Lagoon Towers. Our girls loved the pool, waterslide, swimming with the dolphins and snorkeling in the private area. The Big Island offers so much and the Hilton Waikola is a paradise in and of itself. ", " My husband and I stayed at this resort for 10 night in February/March of this year. I have to admit I was a little concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews of this property. I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said that it's important to do your research about this property before you choose it for your stay. If you know what to expect, you will have a lot better experience overall.We arrived on a late evening flight and arrived at the hotel about 10:30 PM. There was a limited amount of employees working at the desk at this time of night but we had a short wait time. The Hilton HHonors desk was not open at this time but our wait was not excessive at all. We were checked in by Frank at the front desk and he was awesome! He gave us so many hints on what to do while we were there and was so friendly and helpful. He gave us a terrific first impression of the resort. We had read that bell services takes a long time to bring your luggage to the room and we were staying in the Ocean Tower so it was about as far from the front desk as you could get. We were pleasantly surprised that by the time we rode the tram (which was there within a few minutes of our checkout being completed) to our building and walked to our room, the bellman was outside of our door with our luggage. He brought the luggage in for us and showed us around our room and showed us where the ocean would be when we woke up in the morning (it was so dark you couldn't even see it when we arrived). All in all it was an easy check in and arrival in our room. We were amazed by the view from our room when we woke up the next morning. We had a deluxe ocean view room and it was well worth the extra cost! We had an amazing view of Buddha Point and the ocean just beyond. If you opened the door, you could hear the ocean from the room. It was perfect! We had read all the reviews about the noisy birds in the courtyard of the Ocean Tower. Yes the birds do congregate in the trees outside the rooms for sunrise and sunset and yes the noise does bounce off the hotel as it is a circular building. We found that the noise really didn't bother us at all. The courtyard was just outside of the door to the room. There was a hallway and bathroom between that door and the bedroom portion of the room so there was a little buffer there. We also found that if we opened the door to the lanai the sound of the ocean pretty much drowned out the birds. They also stop shortly after sunrise and sunset and it is quiet again. Honestly, we just found that we were able to tune it out and after the winter in Ohio this year, we were actually happy to hear birds!We are Hilton HHonors Diamond Members so we received coupons for $10.00 each off of a meal each day. We usually used this for the Big Island Breakfast. We also purchased the meal card which gave a percentage off of our meals. It was also good for the luau. I would highly suggest purchasing the card....it pays for itself quickly...if you are staying for several nights and/or attending the Luau. The breakfast buffet itself was a bit pricey as other reviewers have stated but honestly we felt that it was a great value. There are so many types of food on the buffet....made to order omelets, scrambled eggs, several breakfast meats, biscuits and sausage gravy, toast and bagels, cereal, fresh fruits and cottage cheese, salads, hot dishes such as soups and mahi mahi, pastries, banana bread, muffins and more. Honestly you could have made this breakfast and lunch depending on what time you arrived. There were several types of juices, coffee, milk. It was an amazing spread and the quality was good. Service varied from day to day. Sometimes better, sometimes not as good but we were always waited on with a smile. David was our best waiter by far. He was very friendly and helpful and quick to tell stories of his time on the Big Island. If you get a chance to sit in his section you won't be disappointed. When the tram arrives there is a big influx of passengers headed to the Big Island Breakfast so if you walk, try to time it between tram stops and your wait won't be nearly as long. It does take a little while to check in but we never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. It is Hawaii...things move on Hawaii time....there is no reason to rush anyway!There are so many things to see at this resort that we enjoyed just walking around each day after breakfast and exploring a different area. Many people mentioned the trams and how often they do or don't run. We found that the trams ran pretty regularly. They had two trams running and we really didn't have too much of a wait. If it wasn't there, many times we would just walk. Yes it is a distance from the lobby to the Ocean Tower but there are so many things to see on your way there that it just didn't seem all that long, nor did it get boring to make the walk. Certainly if your mobility is limited, walking may not be a good option but the trams are handicap accessible and we didn't find the wait time to be unreasonable. Of course we are big Disney fans so perhaps we are just used to waiting for transportation. We ate at Dona & Toni's Pizza, the Orchid Marketplace and the KPC in addition to the Big Island Breakfast during our stay. We found the food to be good for hotel food. Our service was good. We had outdoor seating at KPC for sunset one evening. Definitely worth making the reservation for that. Food is not inexpensive but the experience can't be beat. Our meals and service at KPC were really good and we enjoyed the whole evening. When you are making a reservation, make sure that you request outdoor seating for sunset. It definitely makes a difference being outside as opposed to inside. The resort also offers a romantic dinner for two at Buddha Point for sunset. We didn't do this so I don't know how expensive this may be. We were able to see from our rooma couple who had purchased this dine at sunset and it looked amazingly romantic. I kept thinking it would be the perfect spot for a proposal or to celebrate a special anniversary. The Lagoon area had lots of things to do and see. Paddle boats, paddle boards, snorkeling were all available for a fee. This is no different than we have encountered at other resorts on other Hawaiian Islands. There is also the Dolphin encounter. There is a fee if you want to swim with the dolphins but if you want to just watch, it is very accessible and just fun to watch the dolphins playing and interacting with their trainers and guests. There are several pool areas. Each area has both chairs and cabanas available. Cabanas must be rented from Ocean Sports. We rented Cabana number 80 for day. We loved it! It was situated near the Kona Pool but also had a direct view of the ocean. We were able to sit in our cabana and relax and watch the whales all day. It was absolutely amazing and well worth the cost for a day. The cabana comes with a few services...free gift, water, towels....and there is also a staff who waits on you for drinks and food. Make sure you order early as they do get busier later in the afternoon. There is service till 5:00 PM but you are welcome to stay in your cabana for as long as you would like. We found the employees to be extremely friendly and helpful during our stay. The only thing that could use some improvement is the valet area. We found valet to be a great choice. The self parking is quite a distance from the lobby. Both have a cost and I honestly don't know why anyone would self park for the difference in cost. The only thing was that valet took awhile to bring the cars around. They always seemed to be understaffed. I think what happens is that flights only arrive and depart at certain times of the day and those times are crazy busy at the valet area. After that rush it isn't nearly as busy. If you can time it during the slower time, valet is very efficient. If you hit the rush times, you will be waiting for your vehicle for awhile. We attended the Luau on the property. If you have some flexibility in scheduling a luau, you may want to check with the concierge for a day that may not be quite as crowded. We did the upgraded Ali'i seating and it was well worth the extra cost. It comes with unlimited drinks and they bring the deserts to your table. You also have closer seating to the stage so you can see the show with fewer obstructions. The Luau itself is comparable to other Luau's that we have attended on the island of Oahu. They all tend to be a little \"touristy\" but let's face it a Luau is something that you just have to go to if you are in Hawaii!Unfortunately we didn't get an opportunity to partake in any of the spa services while we were there.We did get to take a look at the spa facilities though and they looked amazing. As Hilton HHonors Diamond Members (I believe that Gold members are also eligible) you can actually utilize the steam rooms and jacuzzi's in the spa areas for no charge so if this interests you make sure you take advantage of this perk. There are also tennis courts and basketball courts with equipment that you can rent. There is shopping on site. There are stores that sell sundries both in the Lagoon Tower as well as the Ocean Tower. Yes things are a bit more expensive there than in your local market but they are available. There is also a shuttle to the Queens and Kings Markets where there are stores if you want to pick up some things to take back to your room. Rooms do have refrigerators so if you want to pick up food or beverages there is a place to store them. There are also stores that sell Island apparel and jewelry. It was just fun to walk around and look in the shops. WIFI was good. We had no problems connecting or staying connected in our room or in common areas. In fact there was WIFI around all the pools, in the tram, in the restaurants, in the lobby. There are parrots and a cockatoo in the lobby and surrounding areas. As others have said, there are photographers that try to get you to get a photo taken with the birds and then sell you a photo. However, they didn't pressure us at all and had no problem with me taking photos of the birds by themselves. If you know that they are there, you can be prepared to tell them no if you don't wish to have your photo taken with the birds. There are no white sand beaches here...no. However, those types of beaches are few and far between on the Big Island in general. However there are plenty of pools and the views of the ocean are astounding!We took many day trips from the resort in the 10 days that we were there. It is a big island so day trips can take the majority of the day but the drive is easy...traffic is pretty nonexistent and the sights you can see are definitely worth the trips. There are things to visit in every part of the island so I am not sure that there is a better location to stay that is closer to getting to these locations. The Kohala Coast is much drier than the Hilo side of the Island so the weather is well worth it. You are about 30 minutes from the airport in Kona but the drive is simple, rental cars are easy to obtain and there is no problem with traffic. All in all we found this to be a wonderful place to stay. Yes there are resort fees and parking fees but again if you know that ahead of time and figure it into your total cost when making your decision of which hotel/resort to book you can make an educated decision. Again, we found this resort to be economical even with the fees included compared to resort costs on Maui or even Oahu. Just make sure that you take a little time to do some research on the resort amenities and costs to make sure that this is the resort for you. If you do that, I think you will be very happy with the resort. We loved it and would not hesitate to return! ", " the hotel, staff, view and location were great but the place is HUGE and you will do a lot of walking. Maybe that's a good thing:)Loved the pool and the dolphin park so if you got a family there is something for everyone there. ", " We stayed here for 7 days. Initially we got an invitation to their time share presentation so this 7-day package is a good deal. Overall, It is very pretty and nice. We love the vacation, both the resort and the nature environment. The air, wind, temperature and views are spectacular that every day you wake up in a great mood. The resort is well designed, grand, high-end, the staff we met here are very nice and warm (although the front desk check in needs some improvement with so many working stand...only one person works there while there are more than 25 people in the line...why don't bring more check in staff? Why waste all those working stand...). But all other staff are super nice. Our room was not super, it has a partial ocean view and mainly facing green area. I wish it was one that facing ocean directly. But maybe the package they offered doesn't apply to those rooms. Food is fantastic but pricy here. With alcohol, 2 person dine in the resort usually costs $100-$150/meal. The Chinese restaurant (kinrin? If I remember the name correctly) provides pretty authentic peiking duck! Yummy! The big island breakfast is fresh but basic, with sausage, egg, and fruit. However, $30/person for this basic breakfast is not cheap. They offer a 10% off food card with purchasing price $29.99, they give you two $10 coupon after you purchase the card so the real cost goes to $9.99. If you eat in the resort at least twice, you definitely save money. Also want to mention the burger place by dolphin quest is comparatively cheaper but still very tasty. The resort does not have a sand beach. Along the coast, all lava rocks or coral. You can walk towards south by Marriott there is the Anaehoomalu Bay beach, it is public beach and there are sea turtles sleeping there after lunch:-) There are plenty of activity in the resort: multiple pools, dolphins, food, golf, tennis... A few tip to people who wants go there: 1, if you like us, don't want to spend $100+ per meal, there is a pretty big supermarket in waikoloa village, we get water milk fruit there...2, restaurant outside the resort are super delicious and cheaper. Recommend: kona brewing co., sushi rock and lava lava beach club. (The lava lava provides ocean view dinning and live performance. Their bamboo Mai tai is so strong so good my husband got drunk after had 2 but he really had fun there...it is a little pricy as well, but food , booze and the view are great!)In sum, we loved our stay. We thought we will never come back at first, but Because the Hilton quality we felt through this resort, we actually bought their time share. So I guess we will be back:) ", " We stayed here using our Hilton points in February. What an awesome experience! We stayed in the elegant presidential suite overlooking the ocean. The view was spectacular, but the views at the whole resort were amazing. The ocean is part of the resort. We snorkelled, kayaked and seen many turtles right at the resort. There are several restaurants priced high to low on the property. A tram and boat are available for getting around but we preferred to walk. Probably not a great choice if you aren't very mobile. The resort is massive and there is lots of walking to get around. You can swim with dolphins for a rather hefty fee, but overall we felt there's was great value here. Amazing pools for both kids and adults. The spa services are top notch! Will certainly go back here! ", " My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a work conference I attended in March. Everything during our stay was excellent! The meeting facilities were perfect for our company, the leisure activities were perfect for us when I wasn't at meetings. The lagoon is a great place where you can swim, snorkel, kayak, etc. in the ocean waters without the waves. Meals and drinks were expensive but that is what we expected for a resort in Hawaii. We stayed in Honolulu for 2 nights after this resort and let's just say it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as a stay as Waikoloa Village. Keep up the Great Work! ", " Phenomenal resort. I cannot imagine a better resort on any of the Hawaiian Islands. All inclusive and worth every penny!! The lagoon was calm and safe for snorkeling of all ages. Guaranteed turtle sightings!! The pool was clean and expansive with a bar and waterside. I recommend the Cantina - excellent value - great food. ", " We have no! words to describe how wonderful our stay was in this hotel. From the arrival to the departure it was amazing! Excellent costumer service! we stayed at the marriot for 2 days and couldn't wait to get out of there, so I called and see how early we could check (it was 9 am in the morning) and they said to give them 1 hour so they could have our room ready. As soon as we arrived we where offered an upgrade to a Makai for a little extra money, we took it and it was so worth it. We had a beautiful view to the dolphin lagoon, and it was like a dream come true for my daughter. We were also offered to buy a discount card for the restaurants for 30.00 which was really good buy as they gave us back immediately 20.00 dollars in coupons. As Hilton gold members we also got 20.00 in credit for breakfast every day. We tried every single restaurant. Our favorite one was the Japanese , a little pricey but worth every penny. the mexican restaurant is good too, the only thing we didn't like was the charge for the salsa, that was 6.00 for 2 sides. Breakfast had a lot of different options, and a good value. Kids receive a colorful bracelet every time they eat in a restaurant, and can trade 6 of them for a free ice cream at the beautiful pool! The lagoon is amazing, we got to snorkel and swim with the turtles, and a lot of other sea creatures .We got a discount with our resort fee for rentals at the lagoon. The boat ride is nice. The birds are beautiful too. The only problem we had was when the next room from our overflow and we had to be moved tho a different room, the front desk manager was nervous with so many movements, but it was really ade to us by Laura who send my daugher a little something and by the Guest experience manager which I don't have his name.Swimming with dolphins is pricey but was a wonderful experience for the kid. Walking thru the property is like being in a beautiful Museum. The Lei and Hula classes were fun. Overall they wowed us from the check in to the check out.. We where very sad to leave and we are hoping we can go back soon. Spend 6 magical days there!! ", " If the ice machine had worked and the cost of breakfast was posted, my rating would have been 10/Excellent across the board. Be sure to catch the Luau at the resort. Auntie Tutu and Family were a delight and the food/drink quality gets 5 out of 5 stars. ", " This resort is beautiful and just amazing!!! The staff is so friendly and accommodating!! We had our company conference here and we all were impressed! I even booked a return package for me and my husbands 6year anniversary! We can not wait then it will be all play no work:)) ", " I stayed in this wonderful Hotel last February, room with view to Dolphins tank. With a big breakfast, good restaurants, shops, gardens, pools. The resort is perfect to take a rest, enjoy the pools with a family or only a couple. The room are comfortable, amenities from spa. The staff are very helpful. This is a excellent resort to stay in Big Island. ", " Yes, there are things one can quibble about concerning this resort but taken as a whole this Hilton property offers as close to perfection as you are going to find in an Hawaiian setting. True the tram might be slow but I doubt you came here for NASCAR racing. And yes the various restaurants scattered throughout the resort are a bit pricey but this is Hawaii and the cost of living here is expensive. The hotel staff down to the groundskeepers are exceedingly helpful and pleasant. The rooms are large, clean and well maintained. Each room has a Sony PlayStation and there are kiosks located in each main building where you can check out free movies and games. Snorkeling in the lagoon is a bit tame compared to an open ocean reef but it is a fantastic place for families with small children or those who are not at Michael Phelps' level. If there is one outside activity you ought not to miss it is a helicopter tour of the island. Peering down into an active volcano is a once in a lifetime experience. ", " Wow is a great way to describe this property. The grounds are impeccably kept. There is artwork and sculptures, and museum pieces scattered all over the grounds - which are immense. There are tons of pools and a huge saltwater lagoon. You can swim with the dolphins, paddleboard, or do nothing. We had a Makai room and the oceanfront location was outstanding. Walk the property for exercise or take the tram. Wow! ", " Loved the facilities and the staff could not have been nicer! Everyone we met, from housekeeping staff to maintenance staff to desk and restaurant employees, they were all SUPER nice and accomodating. ", " The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was uncomparable. The place was extremely well maintained and rooms were very clean. I would definately recommend this hotel. Couldn't have asked for more. Thank you. ", " We are Hilton Gold Members and HGVC owners. We visit a lot of Hilton sites. We have been visiting this site for around 15 years. Waikoloa Village is a wonderful place for couples and families alike, one of the best in Hilton's entire chain. This time we (by chance) had a conversation in passing with one of the pool / recreation staff, Hiti of Ocean Sports. Very nice guy, friendly and helpful. He is a good example of the quality service you can expect while a guest here. Visit, relax, enjoy..... ", " This hotel never disappoints! This was our 6th time and the kids love it. The Lagoon and pools are great! So is the service. We referred another family this year and they happened to be there are the same time as us. We all had a great time. Couple of things to know. Be prepared to walk. It's a huge resort so plan an extra 10-15 minutes for walking. Food is pricey - Go to town and buy breakfast/lunch items. It will save you a ton and allow you to eat at their restaurants and night. (sorry hilton just telling the truth!) Overall this is a perfect vacation spot for the family. Plenty to do for everyone. ", " My wife and I just came back from Hawaii, celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. At the end of the second full day, on the Road to Hana trip in Maui, my wife lost her footing at the end of a hike, and fractured her left foot and ankle. Quite frankly, I wanted to go home, but she insisted we stay. So we canceled most activities as she got along in a wheelchair and crutches.We came to the Hilton Waikoloa Village on Friday, August 15, 2014. The hotel is aptly named as a village -- it is a 63 acre complex. My initial concern was getting around with my wife in a wheelchair, particularly since our original room was at one end of the complex (opposite to where the pool and shops were located).My wife called the front desk and was fortunate to connect to Ms. McGarrity Harney, the Guest Experience Manager. To say that she adopted us like we were her family is an understatement. She immediately told us that she would find us a room closer to everything. She more than lived up to her assurance, getting us a room with a beautiful ocean view close to the poos and shops and more accessible to the rest of the complex. Moreover, she kept on checking on us the remainder of our trip to make sure everything was going okay. Because of her and others we had a superb stay.If it ended there, I would have been happy, but it didn't. Kathy (i'm sorry I don't remember her last name) from the activities desk, went out of her way to make sure that I got to go to Pearl Harbor and Honolulu (we had to cancel our original trip and no other bookings were available), but she got me both a flight and tour for me. That trip was the highlight of our trip (for me).It didn't end there. A young girl (early 20s) named Shayna assisted us getting a cabana. Seeing the distress my wife was in, she came to my wife while I was in the pool swimming, saying \"this arrived for you.\" She handed my wife a get well card signed by the entire pool staff.I would not have expected this level of service. Either the people at the Hilton Waikoloa Village are great actors or they're among the friendliest people in the world.I hope I get back to Hawaii (from NY), and I know I'll be heading back to the Hilton Waikoloa Village.Thank you. ", " I have been here in 2010. I promised to myself that I will come back with my whole family. And now 2014, I am back with 11 others of my daughters, sons and grandchildren. We truly enjoyed this resort. We stayed only 3 days before flying back to Honolulu. Its is really not enough. My daughters said, they too will come back to enjoy more. We love snorkeling at the lagoon with live Green Turtle swimming in the same lagoon. The weather is superb! Its water features around the resort is so calming. Big Island Hawaii is truly awesome, and Hilton Waikoloa Village is a truly the best place to stay. ", " I had to make this trip under sad circumstances. I was very shocked the GOV put me up in such a place. I had an amazing and excellent trip. I am currently planning a return visit with my family. If you are on the Big Island, this is the place to stay, but make sure you get out and explore! ", " We have stayed here quite a few times and always enjoyed ourselves. Great place for the kids, with lots of things to keep them entertained. Also perfect place to watch the sunset and whale sightings during the whale season on the hill by the statue. We grab food from the Chinese restaurant and eat while enjoying the beautiful scenery! Love the multiple pools and walking around the grounds looking at the pretty landscaping. This is our favorite hotel on the big island. ", " The room was very clean and comfortable. The front desk was extremely helpful with all of our questions. It's a huge property with so many things going on for everyone to participate in that you feel like you could stay at the Hilton for quite a few days without leaving the grounds. We've been there twice and have booked another visit in a few months. There's entertainment, food, shopping, a spa, all sorts of pools, a lagoon and it borders the ocean with spectacular views; what more could a person want. I was even able to swim with a sea turtle. Can't wait to see it again. ", " Resort was very large but transit with tram and boat help facilitate full access. There are times were walking would be faster but with two young kids who always wanted to take the transport it was just easier to wait.Everyone from check in to check out was friendly and customer service oriented.Beautiful grounds with many pools and ocean fed lagoon with sea turtles was the highlight of our trip!Would definitely return to this hotel. For a seasoned road warrior was within driving distance to make a day trip to VNP. ", " This place is beautiful, and it is huge. It's easy to intentionally get lost here and before you know it, your frappacino is down to a few whipped cream dregs; your swim trunks are again dry after several trips to the pools and one snorkeling foray into the ocean; and the sun is setting while you realize you haven't even considered what to do for dinner. It's timeless and beautiful, and no matter how much you want to see on the Island, your first, and probably most difficult challenge is to pry yourself away from the luxury and beauty of this resort.To those who have said the decor is dated, I whole-heatedly disagree, and I have been to many nice places and many dated ones (for dated hotels, check out just about anything in Honolulu!). My wife and I both think that all the surroundings here are classic, timeless, and in good repair/condition. If you come here to critique fabric patterns, you will never get the point of the place - never ever. Also on the positive side, there are plenty of activities here, and several ways to get around the property.As to the negatives - and they are all relative negatives, given the unique location, design, vision and condition of the property - all the food, services, activities, and items for purchase at the resort are ridiculously expensive. My advice is several-fold: coffee and ice cream here are great. The other restaurants are not just bad: they suck. Really suck. We had two of the worst Americanized Asian dishes we have ever choked down. Eight of the toughest shrimp ever (with NO vegetables at all included with the \"dish\") and tender but awful sizzling chicken cost more than $70, including a $5 dessert, normal tip, and no drinks other than tap water. Worst deal on the Island so far. Oh, and the rice you ask? That costs extra. Have you ever had an extra charge for plain rice with your 8 hard rubbery $28 non-local previously frozen shrimp? The waitress should have been embarrassed to serve this crap, but both of our dinner selections were ones she recommended. Until they start paying guests to attempt this awful eating challenge, or unless they contract with outside food providers, steer clear of eating here.Another rip-off/joke: many of the chairs and chaises are \"reserved\", which means you can only sit there if you pay almost the price of your room for the day. Yes, a two chaise pad cost up to $200 a day, even though the resort is largely empty since it is the off-season with kids having just returned to school. So instead of enjoying these views and such, those of us who were staying here, mostly just took photos of the beautiful scenery with many empty chaises in the foreground. We couldn't play the 9-hole mini golf course on naturAl grass either, because they were setting up stands to shoot several episodes of Wheel of Fortune. Not kidding. A non-sequitur to be sure. Wifi service here was awful for our portable devices (rarely worked), but plugging in a laptop, we got free fast service.The staff have all been very friendly; the accommodations nice, comfortable, and clean; and the location just couldn't be better. The Marriott is very close by and I stayed there a year ago. It doesn't hold a flame to this place. The dining area view is fantastic at the Marriott, but nothing else there comes close to this comparatively gigantic place. And while this resort is large, it is exceedingly well spread out with many nooks and crannies to get lost and enjoy your very own little slice of natural beauty at the edge of the earth. ", " Having missed out connecting flight, we spend night #1 in LAX, starting our 12 year anni off to a bad start. But Manager Jennifer greeted us upon arrival, with vouchers abundant, and she comped late checkout.. We requested upgrade prior to arrival, and she graciously accommodated us. Was happily shocked to find swanned towels, rose petals and Happy Anniversary shaped out of pebbles in room, without having requested them. Stunning location, room and property. Spa staff exceptional. Not a bad word to say about Ocean Tower. Didnt swim with the dolphins, but lounged around enormous property instead for the duration of our trip. If its the big Island you want, we cant think of a better hotel. Wifey & I will remember forever. ", " It's a large resort with 1200+ rooms on 3 different towers so it the experience for everyone maybe different but you have to expect what not everything is perfect in ANY hotel. People on all the review sites all say to stay in the Lagoon towers... so make sure you get a room in the Lagoon Tower.Granted we stayed for 3 nights in one of the best rooms in the hotel, Dolphin Suite in the Lagoon Tower, it was a fantastic experience. Dolphins playing right outside our balcony and the hot tub. It was fantastic. My 6 yr old didn't want to leave. I can't say much about the other towers but all the rooms on that side of Lagoon tower had a beautiful view of the ocean, lagoon and dolphins. And everyone was so friendly and I have to give a shout out to Kelli at the HHonors desk. One of the friendliest check-in experience I've ever had. When I had a discrepancy with a charge that wasn't mine on my bill, the person on the phone promptly took care of it.The Luau was very loud and could be heard from the parking lot and the hotel but only few days a week no big deal. We did not eat dinner at the hotel because we had other plans on all 3 nights already set but KPC looked really nice.The large pool near the lagoon tower was awesome and the lagoon itself was pretty cool. Tons of fish and turtles swimming by makes for excellent snorkeling without the pounding waves of the ocean.Self parking is quite large and not a bad walk. We chose self, over valet since we'd be going in and out 3 to 4 times a day and the walk wasn't bad at all.Gold or higher HHonors members get 2 x $10 vouchers per night (assuming two guests) toward any food in the resort. We used ours for two breakfasts at the coffee stands(coffees and breakfast sandwiches) and ice creams from the shaka shack. It's resort pricing so it is not cheap but the vouchers help make it more palatable. All in all we have to give two thumbs up and we will DEFINITELY be coming back. ", " We stayed here for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon and were initially overwhelmed with how much there was in this one resort!! It was out if this world! Everything that you could possibly need; this resort had! The grounds were beautiful, breakfast was amazing! I loved that we could help ourselves :) the pools were beautiful, snorkeling! we stayed in the Lagoon Tower and our room over looked the Dolphins. This was amazing to me as a dolphin lover :) I swam with the Dolphins. It was amazing! We ate pretty much at every restaurant and our favourite was KPC- we are here twice. The first time we had an amazing experience - Warren was amazing, so welcoming, tentative and made our experience perfect! The second time we were not served for a while & the waitress was quiet forgetful- but nonetheless the view & food was amazing! Each restaurant/ bar was very good! The only thing I would say that obviously, because it is so big, it's a very busy resort... So as honeymooners we had a great time but were also thankful when we moved to our quiet hotel after staying at the Hilton. It is just a breathtakingly beautiful place that I will definitely be going back to- especially when we have little ones! It's perfect for families and kids! :) loved our whole stay! ", " I've have been to the Hilton Waikoloa more times that I can count and it is always such a great experience. The grounds are impeccable (everything is so clean), the pools are incredible and the restaurants are amazing! I recommend anyone going to the Big Island stay at least one night there (although you'll never want to leave). The room was so comfortable. I've stayed in both the Ocean and Palace towers and they are both amazing. We had a nice view of the golf course and were right by the elevators and didn't hear them even once. The pools are a little cold but after getting sunburned the first day, they felt pretty nice, plus the cave is great if you get too much sun! And the Spa experience was the best Deep Tissue I've ever had. Get there early to take advantage of their facilities and request Laura for your massage, amazing!! ", " Hotel / Resort staff made us feel comfortable and safe during our stay. They reflected what \"Aloha Spirit\" is. The property itself had a part of the Hawaiian plants and history teaching and showing the visitors a small part of Hawaii. For our comfort, the resort provided a tram and boat transportation to and from the hotel to the rooms. We did have the option of a 15 minute walk. Staff there were alert in checking on the guests to see if they needed anything. ", " I travelled here with my husband & 2 kids (12 & 13). We stayed in a Ocean View Room in the Ocean Tower (Room # 3087). We found the resort to be beautiful, very big but certainly not crowded. The trams & boats are great but sometimes timing can mean that walking is quicker. Yes there are birds that chatter loudly around sunset but these really don't bother you. The pools were clean and the slides were great fun. The photo session included with your resort fees is certainly worthwhile although you do have to purchase the photos. The Dolphin Quest was amazing, the four of us did the basic adventure which we would highly recommend, the 20 minutes with the dolphins was plenty of time. The Lagoon (including the wild sea turtles) was great, the equipment hire was priced as expected. The luau at the Hilton was good and if staying at the hotel is saves time travelling to a luau at another location (i.e. like in Waikiki). Restaurants were a bit pricey although Dona & Toni's pizza place was lovely, best BLT pizza we have ever had. I would suggest you have a car to visit local restaurants and shops (with ABC). Discount Hawaii car rentals were great & cheap (Brand 6 = Thrifty). Kids take your own snorkel & googles to save the hire price. One complaint .. Room service charges US$10 per delivery, which also applies even if you are wanting a couple of champagne flutes??? ", " this Hilton Hotel has it all, food, boats, trams, rental cars, and dolphins to boot. I will stay there again in the future. I stayed for 2 weeks and enjoyed the 3 or 4 sets of pools on the grounds. I enjoyed looking at all the different paintings ", " This is an amazing property, filled with beautiful artwork. This was our second stay. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower again (one of three towers). We had a beautiful view of the ocean and of the playful dolphins in the pool right below our room. You do a lot of walking at this huge place, but the views make it all worthwhile. And if you can't walk, you can take the boat or the train. It's a lot like Disneyland! When you swim or paddle boat in the lagoon, you have a good chance of being accompanied by a sea turtle, since the lagoon is open to the ocean, and critters swim back and forth from one to the other. The restaurants are all excellent, with the exception of the Mexican cantina, which was truly the worst Mexican food we have ever tasted. The other downside is that we had booked our rooms six months in advance, with a request to be as close as possible to the other couple we were travelling with. We ended up being three floors apart, with the front desk unwilling to do anything about it. ", " One of our favorite resorts for a stay vacation in Hawaii without going very far. Hotel itself is very large consisting of the Lagoon, Palace and Ocean Towers. In between these room towers are beautifully maintained grounds, trails, artwork and waterways that you can either walk or ride. Hotel provides free monorail and boat transportation thru out its property. Swimming pools, hot tubs, waterslides and the Lagoon will keep everybody happy while you cool off from the hot hawaiian sun. Some families enjoy the Dolphin Quest program where you can swim with the trained dolphins for a fee. Reasonable daytime dining can be found all over the property with musical entertainment at Happy Hour. Alternative dining can be found at the Queen's Marketplace as you enter the drive to the hotels. Yelp.com can give further reviews. We have stayed here several times in the past and plan to stay more in the future. Note: we stayed here when Wheel of Fortune was shooting a week of episodes and got a chance to have an audition with them. Such fun. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa has so much to do, so much to see and so many places to eat, you never have to leave the resort! With shopping, a tram and a boat to get around, several pools, hot tubs, a luau, sea turtles, ells, water toys, and so much more, I have stayed at this resort twice in the last two years and will be going back again soon. It has approx. 12 places to eat, a gym and some of the best scenery on the island. If you do decide to leave the resort, it's a great central location. Saddle road is a great way to get to the other side of the island much quicker. Kona is just 30 minutes South. There is another resort just 5 minutes North where there is more shopping and Tommy Bahamas' Restaurant. I would recommend the Hilton Waikoloa to everyone! Whatever you are into, the Hilton is the best place to stay on the Big Island!!! ", " Beautiful grounds, the whales were breaching in February right off the point - great fun to watch! $$$$ and worth it at least once. If you come with kids there are a ton of pools and activities on the grounds and off site that will keep them interested. If you're wanting the luxury setting, the stores and restaurants nearby can keep your budget for activities and fun rather than spending all the cash on dining. The golf course looks amazing. There are exercise classes that you can participate in and we highly recommend Kona Honu Divers for the evening Manta Ray dive which we HIGHLY recommend. It is going back on our bucket list to do again. :-) ", " Past years, we have stayed the Fairmont Orchid or the Mauna Kea; this year we tried the Hilton Beach Hotel at Waikola. While each resort rate five balls, in our opinion, this HiltonBeach Hotel was the most fun. The resort grounds are the most contrived of the three, however, it proved to be the most interesting as well.... If you enjoy observing and studying tropical fish or viewing dolphins, or a couple of healthy sharks up close, the Hilton is the place. We participated in the \"Trainer for a Day\" program with Dolphin Quest, right there on the property and while there were many highlights, this proved to be the best. You become very involved with the trainers and the 13 dolphines for over five and half hours. The cost helps support the dolphin program which also is a research facility. After that, one can snorkel all day in the resort's separate lagoon, safely, while viewing sea turtles, eels and all sorts of tropical fish without any major tidal waves to fight. A notable difference with the Hilton, particularly from the Mauna Kea, is that all the on-site personel seemed genuinely hospitable, friendly, helpful and unpretensious. We had planned to stay at the Mauna Kea for a walk-in week (Feb 2014) ... but, when we identified ourselves as repeat guests, they never even asked our name is but rather identified a $700 room per night ... plus parking. BTW, the Mauna Kea beach is a public beach, should you want an ocean swim expeerience. We checked into the Hilton Beach Hotel and discovered a delightful time all week, in all respects. Ths staff in particular are so nice ... also, it seemed other hotel guests were friendlier. Our next visit to the Big Island will probably at the Hilton again; and by the way, you will probably save about $4-500 a night.  We would recommend any of these resorts but ", " It is clear whoever designed Hawaii knew the islands but thought he could do better. The bay is calm and clear. The grass goes all the way to the ocean. Everything is level. This is the disneyland version of Hawaii.But who cares? It is a fantastic hotel. We spent here four nights, and had a blast. Swam with the dolphins (pricey, but great!), eat good food, snorkeled in the lagoon (lots of animals), and had a very very good vacation. ", " I really enjoyed staying in Hilton Waikoloa Village. Shopping place is a little bit away from the hotel (25 minutes by walk or 5 minutes by rounding bus that circulates every 20 minutes with 2 dollars). The inside infrastructure of the hotel is almost perfect. Joining some guide tour is recommended for trip in the big island. ", " Actually went here for our honeymoon in Sept 2010. This hotel is so big it reminds me of a Disney resort. You have to take a tram or ferry to get around the whole resort. Each ferry stop has a bar beside it...awesome. We walked the whole thing to see if we could beat the ferry..nope! LOLThe lagoon dumps from the ocean and we snorkeled with sea turtles, stingrays, eels, fish, etc. THAT was amazing. Dolphin Quest was great...just wish you could have held on to the dolphins to ride with them,or actually swim around with them. They had you stay on one side of the area only.Drinks and food were pricey but what I expected from resorts. Very good though. ", " I am appalled at some of the negative reviews I have seen for the Hilton Waikoloa Village and wanted to be sure that people reviewing this page has, what I think, is a more accurate portrayal. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times over the course of the last 4 years, and will be returning for another full week March 14th-March 21st. We have chosen this hotel time and time again because it is simply the best at everything it does. The rooms (particularity in the newly remodeled Lagoon Tower) though I have stayed in all 2, are spacious and extremely clean. Every staff member I have ever encountered in 4 years there has been exceedingly kind and helpful. The food is delicious at all on-property restaurants....my personal favorite being the Lagoon Grill. The pools are outstanding (and clean) and there are endless activities for kids.Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is in a secluded area. Yes, the hotel is virtually surrounded by lava rock and it is not on a beach. But this is the Big Island! Kilauea is still erupting and the island is still forming! If you want endless shops and floods of people then go to Waikiki on Oahu. Otherwise, take this hotel for what it is and what it is great at: giving you and your family a little piece of unpolluted Hawaiian paradise with excellent food, service, and accommodations. You would have to be crazy to not like this place.Counting down the days until my next stay... ", " Hilton Grand Vacations had been calling me for years to go on one of their vacation packages. They always offered Orlando or Las Vegas, places I have been more times than I can count and had no desire to go. The last time they called, they said well, where would you like to go? I said Hawaii. It was on the list of states I hadn\u2019t been and it was a warm climate, a good place for a winter vacation. Hilton offered me a desirable 5-night package that had to be used in six months. Sorry, I said, I can\u2019t go until February 2014 (it was Jan 2013) and I want six nights. It was the earliest time we could go and I didn\u2019t want to fly from New York for only five days. They extended the time for me, accommodating my needs, so I bought the vacation.Now on the Big Island in Hawaii, the company has been excellent about accommodating our needs. Once I booked the time, I received several phone calls to go over the details. I had a personal concierge upon arrival, answering questions and helping with logistics of our trip. She was a dear and everyone here has been more than accommodating.Our car rental is perfect and the condo we are in is a beautiful 2 bedroom with terrace, wi-fi and full kitchen. We are kosher, so we brought some of our food and were easily able to cook, heat up and manage in the kitchen. There is even a washer and dryer and they provide small things, like detergent for the washer and dishwasher.The property is magnificent, gorgeous pools and daily activities. Unlike other resorts, which simply post the activities, I got a call each day with the activities the next day. This pulled people to the activities, all of them very cool and attractive. I should mention there is no beach on the property but we could easily drive 15-30 minutes and be at a beach of our choice. On days when the sun didn't shine in the morning, we visited the Islands active volcano and one day we flew to Oahu to visit pearl harbor and Waikiki.The package sold to us include the car rental, 25,000 Hilton Honors points and the commitment we would sit in their sales office for 2 hours. I had no intention of buying one but it was a small price to pay for the vacation. Sitting here, with all the amenities, my husband and I are thinking it may be a good idea. We bought it. We like Hilton, it is a trusted brand. ", " We just got married at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and I have to say we couldn't have picked a better place!! The hotel grounds are exceptional, the rooms were super comfortable, but most of all the people we had the pleasure to work with were undeniably the best in the business!! We had close to 70 people come to our wedding and the majority of them stayed at the Hilton with us. It was a chance of a lifetime to vacation with our most favorite people in the world...all at once! Plenty of things to do on property, snorkeling in the lagoon, hanging out at the pool, having a cocktail or two in the lobby bar, and more. The icing on the cake was the wedding which, like I mentioned in the title, was the best one EVER (I might be partial...)!! Robin and Didi made sure every detail was perfect and went above and beyond to make the day (and the entire vacation) magical for us. We had the ultimate dream team with Fletch photography, DJ Tiger, Ainahua florals, and Robin and if we had it to do all over again we wouldn't change a single thing. ", " We stayed in a Grand Vacations Club Time share room. The room was absolutely fabulous! The staff was super friendly and eager to help in any way that we needed it.The pool areas were the astonishing! Very large pools at our building and a maze of pool areas at the resort itself. The lagoon was the highlight of the trip by far! 20 turtles swimming about for the guests to mingle with and a huge assortment of other tropical fish swimming around also. We were anxious to see when it was that we could book another stay in this tropical paradise! ", " We enjoyed staying t the Hilton Village. It in itself is a great place but within hours of some really cool adventures ie: Volcano national park, Black Sand Beaches, Hilo, and Rainbow falls. We traveled as a family of 11 and were all pleased and accommodated well. ", " Great landscape, wherever you look is beautiful, a lot of pools, waterfalls, from your bedroom you can see the whales (better with a pair of binoculars), also can see the dolphins in one of the pools of the hotel and for a fee (expensive) you can spend some time with them in the pool. Food is good but not as good as the hotel and it's expensive. You can swim in the salt water beach inside the hotel and do snorkel to see beautiful fishes and even turtles under water. The hotel offers a large collection of sculptures from Asia, also recommend the shows about Hawaii traditions. The hotel is so big that it has a train and boats to move around, I stayed 5 nights and didn't get to see it all. Most of the staff is very nice, I would definitely come back. I assure everybody this is a marvelous place. ", " This resort is amazing! Yes, it is large. Yes, it takes time to get places. I'm not in a hury when I'm on vacation and I have two legs so the size didn't bother me. The grounds are amazing. Restaurants awesome! KPC was the best meal we had on the big island. We had a partial ocean view and it was a true partial ocean view and golf course view. There is so many pools we couldn't even explore them all. The rooms were nice. A little dated. But most everything in Hawaii is dated so we expected it. All of the staff very so happy and friendly. Never once did we get bad customer service at the resort or a bad meal.The bad: Pillows are way too soft. No coffee maker in the room. It is a pod type coffee maker. So you cant buy coffee and make your own. One of the best parts of a trip to the Big Island is the coffee and it sucks having to get up in the morning and hike downstairs for a coffee. The pools close at night. There is no hot tub anywhere close to the Ocean Tower. Big screw up by the developer. One of our favourite things on vacation is an evening hot tub so this was very dissapointing to us.DO NOT do the timeshare presentation. First of all it is not a presentation, they lock you in an office with a used car salesman alone and he trys to drill it in your head that you must become an owner... that you have no choice in the matter.... and if you don't he calls you a coward. The salesman got so angry with my husband that I thought he was going to attack him... we were nothing but polite but our reluctance to hand over $100,000 immediately made him angry. This was the worst vacation experience ever! We left the \"presentation\" with no information and no idea what we could have got for our money. Shame on Hilton... they say they have a no pressure policy. Well all we got was pressure and bullying.The price per night for this hotel was reasonable. We will return again I'm sure. But we will buy a coffee maker at walmart in Kona.... and stay away from any sales agents. ", " This resort is excellent and my children rated it the best holiday ever. It is widespread with many rooms and guests, but not crowded at the lifts or lobby like Vegas hotels. The resort is simply beautiful with parrots welcoming you at the reception, different section with different themes. Best part is the beautiful sunset that can be seen from various parts of the hotel, very romantic and rarely found in the city. Even children will quiet down and watch the magic moments after spending a long day at the pool. The lagoon is amazing. It is enclosed with sea water at shallow man-made beach. So safe for the families, with paddling, rafts for rent to swim with turtles, or to have lunch delivered to your chair. My kids love the dolphin park where they can swim with the dolphins and kiss them. We have lots of pictures and video to record their smiley faces. Staff are friendly and helpful. The only drawback is that it is far away from volcano park. Be prepared to spend one whole day to and from the volcano. But it is worth it. Enjoy! ", " We had a great ten day holiday at this facility. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, watching the sun rise each morning, and the surfers in the bay. Even though, at times, this resort was full, we never felt crowded. We visited the different pool areas and restaurants, all of which we enjoyed. From whale watching at the point, to waving to family members back home on the web cam, it was a very pleasurable experience. The staff is very well trained, friendly and helpful. My husband is talking about applying for the position of \"fun consultant\". I have limited mobility and the trains and boats make everything easily accessible. ", " Gorgeous grounds and art. Friendly staff. Great bed and spacious room. Fancier and more artificial than I would have chosen for myself, but was glad to be there for a friend's wedding. Felt entirely safe walking in the area at night. Perhaps I'm stingy but it felt like Hilton was trying to \"play every angle\" to optimize their income, but on the other hand, they did make it exceedingly easy to do everything to expedite any activity one might wish to have. ", " I have stayed at this hotel 4 times and I don't tire of it. The first time was when it was first built in 1988. There were more boats then, all the restaurants were open, and there were parrots in the breakfast room so things have been cut since that opening, but the main essence of the property is still the same.For those of you that are into simple, small and elegant, this may not be your thing. But if you want to enter a fantasy world resort with boats to take you to your room, a monorail, and swimming in a lagoon or paddling among sea turtles, then this is for you. There is no beach at this property, but there is a man made sand beach and a walkway along the ocean to stop and watch the sunrise and sunset. There are different kinds of birds in the lagoons. There are dolphins to watch for children. I like the variety here. There is a shuttle that takes you to the shopping center down the street. The staff is hard working and cordial. I have eaten in the boat landing place, the one by the dolphins, and the steak house. The food was good in all, although resort higher prices.The main negatives here are the high resort fee and the lack of an ocean beach. ", " This was about our 7th stay at Hilton Waikoloa Hotel. The only down side, was the cost of food, but you can get around that, by driving a short distance outside of the Hilton. Inside, everything is as good as its been, outside of the hotel ending the Gold/Diamond lounge, a few years ago. But, they gave me $100.00 Hilton money & 10% off on all purchases. We will be back in Jan or Feb. 2015 for another week. Owning property in Hawaii for over 25 years, we can see the Islands changing from Hawaii to just another state, same stores same everything. The Big Island, is still the last part of Hawaii, that everyone dreams about. Everywhere on the islands, you can find great resorts, but only on the Big Island, can you still find old Hawaii. If you are just looking for a great resort, with palm trees, save your money and go to Fla., if you want real Hawaii, come to the Big Island! ", " We went to the Hilton Waikoloa Village to celebrate my birthday. What an excellent decision! The entire staff at this resort treated us very well but special thanks to General Manager Debi Bishop and her staff members Shelley Root and Jon McFarland. We are Hilton Diamond members and were treated very well. They upgraded our room and sent a great fruit basket and candy basket to our room along with a happy birthday card. The staff at the coffee shops, breakfast buffet, and other dinning locations were all very nice. Service at each location was wonderful. We liked riding the little boats around the resort at night. The resort is very romantic. It is a large resort and it does take a while to walk around; however, we found that to be part of the fun. My wife used the spa several times and loved it. If you plan on exploring anyplace beyond the resort you will definitely need a rental car. We noticed all of the people we met on the Big Island were very friendly and helpful. We did not feel that way on Maui. ", " This resort is one of the nicest I have even been to. The resort is gigantic but there is plenty of transportation (monorail or boat) to get around the resort. The food is expensive but you are on Hawaii and you are in 5 star resort. We did find a locals place in Waikoloa Village called Dave's which was much better priced for breakfast and it was delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. We asked a guest services employee where we could hike and find a natural spring. He sent us on a 2 mile walk along the lava field coast just South of the resort and we found a natural spring in the middle of the lava field. Also along this walk we found ancient petroglyph's carved into the lava fields. Absolutely awesome! The lagoon at the resort is filled with sea turtles and fish and is great for snorkeling. I wish I could live here. We ended up buying a Hilton Grand Vacations Timeshare at the end of our trip. I may never stay at a better resort in my life. BTW the Big Island is awesome!!!!! Make the drive down tot eh most Southern point of the Island and see the green sand beach. ", " The resort is very large with 3 hotel complexes and 5 or 6 large and small pool areas. The walk between the complexes is spectacular because it has so many beautiful art pieces and sculptures that are also often placed in the various gardens. There is a beautiful coy pond by the Japanese restaurant. I think this walk may be about a half a mile which is why they also have a tram that rides back and forth to the lobby. I found the tram to be too slow and I enjoyed the walk each time discovering some new piece of art to admire. The rooms are extremely comfortable. They provide down pillows, a mini fridge, flat screen TV, free Hawaiian coffee, wonderful smelling coconut mango soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion...you can also buy it in the lobby or spa, but it is very expensive. The pool water was very chilly while we were there...it was about 73 degree, so I did not use the pool. You can park your car in the self parking lot for $17/ day or the valet parking for $22/ day. You have to call about a half hour ahead to get your car from valet parking. The resort also offers a program of swimming with the dolphins right in one of their pools. If you have a car there is a mall complex about a mile or two away that has some very good restaurants, otherwise the resort has 5 or 6 restaurants. ", " Paradise is the only word I can think of to describe Hilton Waikoloa Village. My husband and I were fortunate enough to spend a week in December at this amazing hotel. We were celebrating our 42nd wedding anniversary. The staff was so attentive. We had a beautiful suite in the Ocean Tower. Mike Chrinko the Guest Services Manager, sent a bottle of champagne & chocolate covered strawberries to our room. He personally checked on us one evening while we were enjoying a fantastic dinner and sunset at KPC restaurant. If you get the chance you must have dinner there. Cornelius was our waiter and could not have done a better job. They definitely spoiled us. There were so many young families, older couples, people of all ages enjoying the beautiful property, beach, pools, lagoon. We especially enjoyed the Dolphins. We had a great time playing glow ball. My husband enjoyed the beautiful golf course near by. We ate in almost all the restaurants on the property and found them all to have great food and service. The coffee was excellent at Waikoloa coffee co. We loved the boat ride to the Ocean Tower, the tram ride was nice as well. But there is something about looking up at the stars in paradise from a boat. We loved it so much that we are planning to bring our children & grandchildren next year. I have a hard time relaxing and for the very first time I truly found out what relaxing is all about. We cannot thank Mike and the fabulous staff for making our stay truly a memorable one. Can't wait to go back and stay longer! ", " I wont bother renaming all the positives about this resort because they have been repeated ad nausiem. This is simply a remarkable resort. The only bad things? The rooms are a bit dated. Bathroom is TINY. Access to wall outlets are difficult. Im splitting hairs because there really are no big things wrong with this place. ", " Had an excellent stay at this hotel. We stayed in the Ocean tower on the top floor. We could see the whales every morning from our balcony. We had no problem with the Ocean tower location and found the 5 minute walk through the center of the resort would beat the train. If you have an active lifestyle, I wouldn't expect you'd find any complaints with the location of the Ocean Towers. The lagoon is amazing. We brought our own snorkel equipment. We rarely used the pools since the lagoon had so much to offer. We saw amazing fish, sea turtles, eels, etc. We ate onsite some, but found some other places nearby (still in the neighborhood), that had a better price/value. We liked the Cantina in the Ocean Tower. One night we got take-out from the pizza place and watched the sunset on the lounge chairs at the Buddha point - awesome!!! The hotel lacked entertainment both during the day and at night. You are left to create your own which worked for us during the day, but wished there was more at night. Lava Lava Club down the road was the best option. The Lounge connected to the lobby was okay offering live music each evening. We leveraged the fitness center every day (which was very nice). If you like to run, the property is about 1 Mile point to point, so makes for a great run along the coast each morning as well. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village, is a fabulous place for a family! Great activities for kids, the food was wonderful, clean rooms, and a wonderful staff! We had a room overlooking the dolphins, which the kids loved! We did a dolphin encounter and whale watching, which were great experiences. The pool was unbelievably clean and the drinks were wonderful! I would highly recommend it to anyone with a family! Not a party hotel, very laid back! ", " We enjoyed this hotel very much. Our room overlooked the Dolphin pools and the Ocean we every morning we sat on our deck and watched the Dolphins. Loved it! We stayed in the recently renovated part of the hotel and loved that there was a coffee shop just below our room. Every morning at about 6am the birds would begin to sing and I loved it...but I may have been in the minority as it was quite loud and the sound echoed through the middle of the building...others trying to sleep in probably did not enjoy it as much. ", " High-lights: location, ocean-fed lagoon with TURTLES/fish/etc for snorkeling, lots of great restaurants, helpful staff, close parking, large grounds for exploring, clean room, family friendly, beach rentals (SUP, water-bikes, etc) Low-lights: noisy birds in the courtyard (not that the hotel can help that), uncomfortable bed, one set of elevators not functioning on check-in leading to a long walk with luggage. Highly recommend staying here - bring your snorkel gear! You don't need to go out to sea and get dragged over coral or swept away in the surf (especially with little kids). Awesome food. \"Some\" shopping nearby (according to my wife - not enough). ", " The Lagoon Tower is our favorite building to stay. The people here are outstanding. The restaurants are great, the breakfast buffet is one of the largest, cleanest and has a fantastic setting. The grounds are well tended and one of my favorite things to do here is to take the boat ride. They cut back on the hours that the boats are running. I would suggest they have them available in the morning again so you could take it to The Big Island Buffet. There is so much to this resort, we have not seen it all after being here several times. We will just have to come back again next year. ", " Our first time to this property and we were amazed at how massive this resort was. We stayed in the lagoon tower with an amazing view over the lagoon (and you could see the dolphins!). It was the best tower to stay in, the ocean tower was really far away and the trains come every 20 minutes, whereas you can walk from the lagoon tower. Unless you are planning on spending your whole time at the resort, we definitely recommend hiring a car. The room was huge and all the facilities on site were incredible. Unfortunately we spent more of our time seeing the sites so it wasn't as well utilised for us. We ate at the King's Court- Roy's and the Macaroni Grill Restaurant rather than at the restaurants. The grocery store in the queens marketplace was so expensive to just buy staple items, ", " Beautiful Resort Grounds: Something for everyone in the family (including my 4-yr old): Dolphin Quest, (Little) Kids Eat Free, Tram, boat rides, water slides, DVDs and Video Games, bird wildlife (Nene geese, flamingos, cranes), Museum walkways! Wide variety of shopping. Wide variety of cultural food to choose from! Fun Family memories! ", " My wife and I spent a week in December 2013 at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The first time I visited this property was over 20 years ago, and at the time it was known as the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa. It is still a beautiful property, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resort offering lots of water activities on site. The hotel grounds surround an ocean lagoon, and the property rents paddle boards, snorkeling gear, kayaks, pedal boats, etc. to explore the lagoon. There are also two extensive fresh water pool areas with water slides. One of those pool areas closed for renovation part way through our stay which is not too surprising since December is probably not their busiest time of year. My preference was the lagoon where I snorkeled with sea turtles and schools of fish.There are several restaurants at this resort, and we dined at four of them. They are a bit expensive, and the food was okay, but generally speaking, they all offered excellent atmosphere and views. There are three different \"tower\" areas in which guests stay. We stayed in the \"Lagoon Tower\" on the first floor, and in my opinion this is the best place to be at this resort. We were steps away from the Dolphin pens, we had our own back patio looking out onto the Lagoon and we were a reasonable walk from the main reception area of the resort (the largest tower is a long distance from the reception area). This property is unique because there is are three ways of being transported around the property; you may walk the wide corridors that are lined with various art objects, there is a canal in which motor boats run a circuit throughout the complex and there is an electric tram. Our room was closes enough that it was always faster to walk to our room, but families with little children would probably love the alternate transportation options. Our room location was its best feature. The room was recently renovated, and was nice, but on par with so many other Hilton properties in which I frequently stay. If you come to this resort, do not spend time in your room! ", " We loved staying here and would return. We walked the property but enjoyed riding the trains and boats for fun. Food was good. The cats were delightful. Adult only pools were a nice touch. You can choose a quiet area or a room in the middle of the action. The front desk were very helpful. ", " Great place to stay. So many nice places to eat, shop, relax. Also there are some really great beaches nearby. It's not too far from Kona Airport and the staff was great. Would definitely stay here again. ", " We enjoyed our vacation here so much the last time we came back. There is no beach on the property but a nice lagoon that offers snorkeling (lots of exotic fish and big, protected turtles) and other fun things to do. It's a huge property and the various hotels are connected by a little train or boats. Or an interesting museum walk. There are tons of things to do. One of my favorite things is the arrival of the minah birds in the evening. The noise is pretty loud but I love it. It's unique. All in all, it's a great family place. ", " Me and my husband came on our honeymoon and have spent the last 6 nights here. It has been absolutely amazing. The resort is absolutely gorgeous and considering how big it is they have maintained it well and we have had great experiences with everyone (other guests and staff as well). We do not have one complaint (well just one from Lagoon Grill). The concierge has been great, room service has been so accommodating especially every time we needed extra towels. It truly is paradise and waking up every morning in this beautiful resort just makes you want to never go back home. We will be sad to leave.KPC was delicious and a little expensive but a great experience having the sunset dinner and our pictures taken. I had their version of surf and turf ( 8oz filet and 2 lobster tails with asparagus and mashed potatoes-it was decent) and my husband had the special (fish of the day with spinach risotto-better than mine, it was good). We also attended the Luau which was beautiful. The dancers were spectacular, the food was great, and the staff was so attentive. It was our first luau ever and we loved every bit of it. Shaka-cone, I cannot remember the lady but she was great! she was the only one working and I guess everyone was craving ice cream that night because there was a little bit of a line but she did not let the line ruin her mood. She greeted everyone with a smile and apologized for the wait (it was understandable though, she was the only one there). I got the auntie Debbie berry beach sundae and it was sooo good (strawberry cheesecake ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream).We also made a trip to Lagoon grill one night, over-priced burgers but still good. It hit the spot. The only bad thing that I could say about this trip was our encounter with Teresa from Lagoon Grill. Me and my husband had been wanting a burger from Lagoon grill real bad but we got caught up in Kona getting last minute gifts for family and friends. As we arrived back to the resort we rushed to Lagoon Grill because we were not sure what time they closed since it was a Sunday. As we walked up we were greated by Marrey who was so nice and I asked her if they were still open and she told us to have a seat anywhere. As me and my husband went to sit down apparently it was in Teresa's section and she was ready to go home. She did not even look at us, and as she walked past us she did not hesitate to let us know that they were closed, and went about her business. She was quite rude. As we were about to walk away I decided to ask someone else since we had just been told to sit anywhere and again we were told by a different girl to sit anywhere. So I guess Teresa had mentally clocked out. So we sat somewhere else and Marrey was our server (who seemed to have a majority of the tables since I guess Teresa was turning people away) and she greeted us with a smile and great service. The food was quick and in no way did we feel rushed. Marrey was sweet and great just like everyone else we had encountered (except obviously Teresa).Our suggestion is the resort is great but also rent a car and go to other locations. The island is so big and there is so much to experience that it would be a shame to just stay in the resort. The Big Island is beautiful, you will never want to go back home. ", " We have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for the past three years during the Thanksgiving and/or Christmas holiday season. Personally, we love the \"all-inclusive\" feel to the resort, due to multiple restaurants, pools, and the private lagoon. (Please note that I'm not saying these items are included as part of the stay; merely, you don't need to leave the resort and \"drive\" to get to a good snorkeling spot, eat at a good restaurant, etc.)It is a large resort, and therefore they offer many transportation options. The walk time from the Ocean Tower to the lobby is 10 min. at most. We mostly walk during our time there, although I would recommend taking the boat at night (for scenic reasons). This year we opted against renting a car, and chose airport transfers as our transportation to/from Hilton Waikoloa. They do have a car rental company on site if you need a rental car for a day.We have stayed in both the Ocean Tower and Palace Tower, and while I would agree with other reviewers that the rooms are somewhat dated, they are always maintained well during our stay.We always eat the breakfast buffet at Water's Edge. There are multiple food choices to please just about everyone. I'd recommend the fresh papaya, banana bread, and malasadas. The pools are amazing. As a family with children, we prefer the Kohala Pool near the Ocean Tower. Pool depth is ideal for new/ beginning swimmers. The kids love the interconnecting pools and water slides. We enjoy the mixed drinks available at the Kohala Pool bar, although it seems maybe they are \"watered down\" a bit.My husband and oldest son did a dolphin excursion a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. We were very pleased during our most recent stay that a Dolphin Quest employee spent some time chatting with us near the dolphin pools, answering all our questions. She was genuinely interested in answering all of my sons' questions.We love eating at the Boat Landing Cantina. The house made guacamole is a MUST! The margaritas are GREAT, and I'd recommend visiting them during happy hour (from 2 pm - 3 pm daily). We also enjoy the Lagoon Grill. Personally, we are not crazy about the Orchid Marketplace, but mostly because it's cafeteria style- we prefer a sit-down type of restaurant. Orchid Marketplace does offer refillable cups (dolphin or pineapple) which are expensive to purchase up front (I believe $10- $12) but can be refilled for free at Orchid Marketplace during the length of your stay (and for a nominal fee at other restaurants).Our favorite dinner restaurants are Dona & Toni's Pizza and Kamuela Provision Company (KPC). Both have WONDERFUL outdoor seating venues. Pizzas at Dona & Toni's are delicious. My kids love the giant cookie sundaes for dessert! The food at KPC is expensive, but very much worth the cost. As former Oahu residents, we love the Poke! The Waimea tomato salad is amazing, and the Maui Onion ring tower shouldn't be missed. I definitely recommend the Monchong as an entr\u00e9e- delicious!During our most recent stay, we unfortunately were disappointed with Imari. The front sofa in the bar area has a definite mildew odor- hopefully, management will look into this issue and replace the offending piece of furniture. While we did enjoy the \"show\" aspect of the Teppanyaki dinner, there were a few aspects we did not enjoy (bland sauces, large hunks of fat left in meat that was prepared (in the children's steak and chicken entrees)). Maybe we just chose an off night.Overall, this is a great spot to relax and unwind. We enjoy Hilton Waikoloa so much we just booked an impromptu vacation in February. :) ", " This property was great in every regard. From check-in, to the food, to our room, and other amenities. The pools were great and the staff was always helpful and friendly. My wife and were on Christmas vacation and had a great time. The rooms were a bit dated with respect to furniture and carpet but were always clean and tidy. We knew about the resort fee prior to check-in so this was not an issue for us. We were in the ocean tower with a great view out our patio door. I would definitiely return to this property and recommend it to our friends. ", " We did not stay here, but visited all day on our last day on the island. $17 per day parking. I had an 80-minute massage at the spa (AmAzInG) so the kids played with Dad at the pools and ate lunch at the patio grill while waiting for me. Afterwards, I met them at the lagoon area, where my young kids (6 years, 3.5 years and 5 months) were having a blast. Man-made beach area on a no-wave shallow lagoon, which was an inlet from the ocean, complete with fish, sea turtles, snorkeling (we even saw an eel in the coral) and enjoyed paddle boarding for an hour ($40 per 30-minutes). While walking the path to on the property overlooking the ocean, we saw whales coming up for air. The property is gorgeous, with a dolphin-encounter pool that you can watch or participate in, and about 8 lava-rock pools spread throughout the property. The pool water is very cold. The lagoon water warmer, and actually more enjoyable. Visiting the island with 3 young kids, we didn't choose to stay here, but rented the Waikoloa Beach Villas down the road because we wanted to visit lots of off-site beaches and excursions during our trip, and this property was simply too big and far from parking and treking 3 young kids and gear all around the property and too/from the parking lot. If you would want to stay on-site at a resort for a week, this place looked amazing to do so, with all of the resort amenities included. ", " We spent the last several days at the Hilton Waikaloa village and had a great experience. The property is amazing! It is large and takes some time to get oriented so that you can navigate the property easily. However, help is just a step or click away. From the handy on-screen guides on the T.V. in your room to the plethora of concierge desks dotted along the property. We stayed in the ocean tower and had an amazing view of the ocean and sunset. We were fortunate enough to see blues whales from our balcony.Several reviews have mentioned that the rooms need updating, and we agree to an extent. However, we didn't spend very much time in our room. There are far too many things to do on the island! Whether you stay on the property or venture away, the big island is our favorite of all the islands so far. Thanks in large part to the Hilton property. From the wonderful views to the dolphin lagoon and black tip sharks, we were impressed with our stay. A beautiful sand beach is within 5 minutes driving distance for a relaxing day soaking up the sun.We enjoyed the property so much we signed up for a return trip before we left. I don't think you will find another property with the level of service and amenities on site.Thanks to all of the folks who helped us and led us through a wonderful experience on the big island!!Ron & Karen, Lubbock, Tx ", " This resort is outstanding. The property is gorgeous, and there are many great ways to spend your day. Very peaceful and relaxing. The rooms in the Ocean Tower are large and clean, but slightly dated as compared to other Hilton's. The overall resort experience more than made up for the room. Great pools. Loved snorkeling in the lagoon. Whale watching from the shoreline. Lot's of fun. I hope to return one day. ", " We just spent 5 nights at the Hilton - Waikaloa Village and had an amazing time! The resort is beautiful, very clean and offers several good restaurants (coffee shops, pool side, mexican, italian, american, chinese, luau etc\u2026) We visited the spa and had a wonderful experience. The gift shops were great and very reasonably priced. And the pools were very cool, they even had a lagoon with dolphins! We also liked the free movie rentals and in room PS3 for watching movies at night. I can't say anything bad about this resort :) We've done lots of traveling and I was hesitant about a huge resort, but it was wonderful. We were attending a wedding and met friends there, next time I would definitely bring the kids. ", " A great place to stay. Our 2nd visit to the Hilton on this isalnd and it was a graet experience. The overall environment is terrific and the birds, beach, pools, and overall scenery cannot be beat. Can't wait to go back again. ", " After some minor confusion regarding our reserved rate at checkin, the General Manager and other staff at this hotel made our nearly week long stay one to remember. The property is stunning and the plethora of restaurants made the week exciting and full of amazing panoramas, photo ops, and culinary adventures. Riding the tram was a highlight for our toddler and we enjoyed the art and eateries throughout the property as well as the choice of pools, bars, coffee shops, and lawns for relaxing. We hadn't been to the Big Island before but future trips will surely lead us to consider this location again, thanks in large part to how we were treated. ", " My husband and I both LOVE the Hilton Waikoloa and have NEVER been disappointed by the staff, service, rooms, etc. We have always been treated extremely well and are always appointed a nice upgrade when we arrive (gold). In fact, we originally stayed because of a timeshare promotion, but liked it so well, we have returned year after year - sometimes more than once in a year. I am looking forward to our next trip in February this year for our 26th anniversary, and then hopefully another visit with our girls towards the end of the year. We love the work out facilities, then relaxing in the spa afterward, the view, the meticulously kept property and the lagoon - which is my favorite snorkeling spot. The breakfast buffet, although pricey, is fantastic. I love the omelet bar (I request egg beaters) and all of the fresh fruit. The servers have always been very pleasant and attentive. But then again, we are always pleasant and friendly to them when we dine. I also noticed that regardless of whether or not I'm staying there with points, payment, or package, my treatment is still the same - outstanding. I really do feel like I am treated with the goal of making my stay as pleasant as possible starting with being given the available upgraded room upon my arrival. I really couldn't be more pleased with this hotel, the view, and the service. My goal continues to be returning for vacation at least once a year. Thank you, Hilton Waikoloa for such great vacation experiences. I look forward to being back in February! ", " My daughter and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village during the Christmas holiday period. This a hotel on a grand scale, and our experience was even better than expected. The hotel has a vast number of pools throughout the property, which is a real plus. If one pool is too noisy or doesn't have a view like your liking, there are always more options. The hotel, rooms and pool areas are all very well maintained and clean. And there are lots of dining options right on the property. The corridors throughout the hotel are filled with Asian art and Hawaiian art, and the transport throughout the hotel on trams and boats was fun. One can always walk for the exercise, too.The only negatives on this hotel are the lack of a good hotel beach and the overpriced Luau where the food was subpar and the entertainment should have been better. ", " My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village resort for 4 nights using Hilton points; we are Hilton Diamond members. The hotel is very beautiful and large. I think it was about 1 mile from where our car was parked to our room. The hotel has a Disney style train, and also boats, to take you from the hotel lobby to the different resort towers. We found the rooms to be great, and the hotel was beautiful everywhere you looked. There are lots of dining options. I rated the sleep quality as good because the birds in the hotel tower center area were very loud at night ... some would consider this a positive ... like staying in the middle of the amazon!We fould the location very good for visiting the island, but you must have your own car. We pretty much covered the entire Island, but we did not make much use of all the wonderful hotel facilities. ", " Being staying here since 2000. Every year we come to this property and since 2006 twice a year. The property is amazing but the staff is like family. Just overall the best Hawaiian experience is found here. ", " We went through the multitude of photos vacationers had posted and decided that this resort (which was fairly affordable as a vacation package) was too much \"Disney\" and kiddie-friendly for our tastes...we just made the booking for the clean room, while we went about exploring the numerous other Big Island activities. Upon arrival, we discovered extensive twenty-year-old grounds which were well maintained by a courteous and professional staff. If you ever make it to the gym/spa, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the facilities and amenities. The marine life that inhabits the lagoon the Hilton property occupies is teeming and extraordinary: Honus (Green Turtles) enter and leave at their own pleasing and will swim alongside you. Oh...and adults have their own pool and area if you're looking to get away from the screaming kids. ;-) ", " It is so perfect that pushes you to not visit the rest of paradise. Big Island is a beautiful and tranquil place , full of wonders to discover, places to visit, different environments: from the sea to the high mountain and if I had to find a fault at the Hilton Waikoloa Village is that it is so perfect that you would like to stay forever inside, losing the other wonders that the island offers. The property is well designed, green, with many opportunities for food, entertainment, shopping and sea life. Perhaps the internal transportation is a bit ' excessive, upsetting, crazy: boats and train (but you can move yourself also on foot). The service is perfect, the prices are appropriate for the type of structure, but staying tuned you can always find some amazing deals. The sunset is an unforgettable sight, the attention for the environment is great. The property is completely smoke free with few but comfortable (well placed) designated areas for smoking. The staff is extremely courteous and polite. Definitely going back, we had a great experience that I would recommend it highly. ", " My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in late December before flying to Kauai for 4 nights. We booked the stay using Hilton points before the massive devaluation, so the room was just about $183,000 points for an Ocean View in the Ocean Tower (room 6302). However, when we got there, we asked about upgrading, and we were able to upgrade to the Lagoon Tower for just $60 a night. It was totally worth it because the room was large, very nice, and overlooked the dolphin lagoon and had a great view of the ocean. True there is no true beach here but the property is beautiful. We are Hilton Diamond members and did miss the free breakfast usually offered, but we liked the $10 coupons ($20 total per day), which we used to buy stuff at the coffee shop every day. The coffee was expensive but since we could get two delicious large coffees for $10 they were free and that was great! The acai bowls at the coffee shop were delicious too. We ate at the breakfast buffet one morning which was delicious but at $30 per person ($20 with the coupon) we could not eat enough to justify going again. We did enjoy eating at Lava Lava Beach Club just down the road (by the Queens marketplace) although it set us back over $100 both times we ate dinner there. We loved the Big Island and were definitely happy at the Hilton. I don't know that it would be as worth it now though with the Hilton points devaluation, so I'm glad we made the reservations when we did!! ", " We styed in the Ocean Tower, awesome ocean view , nice room with balcony.A large hotel on 10,000 acres,awesome pools,lagoons with dolphins,exotic birds restaurants,spas, boutique . we loved our stay ! ", " Enjoyed it very much. The location is great. It is definitely a place worth going to if affordable. We listened to a time share presentation and our presenter was not pleasant when we did not want to buy. My sister stayed in the main hotel and we stayed in a condo on the golf course. Both were great, ", " Great for kids and families! We like the quiet big island this expansive, family centered resort and it's why we come as often as we can Outstanding snorkeling in their own huge cove in the middle of the resort ith it's own mini beach. You will pay upwards of a $800 just for tha off site in a boat! While expensive, the in site restaurants are great and convenient. If you want variety and to save money, there are dozens of restaurants with five to twenty minutes away. Want excitement? There are pony if terrific excursions and a little research in tripadvisor will get you there. ", " This resort is simply amazing. They have a tram or boats that will take you around the hotel to get you to your room. The grounds are beautiful with lots of artwork and statues all over. You can't go wrong if you stay at this resort. Sea turtles come into the bay by the waterfall and you can go and swim around them, but don't touch them(we may have touch them a little :D). There are nice beach areas by the lagoon or very quiet areas out by Bubba Point. If your looking for a relaxing resort to take the family this place is it with multiple pools and the ocean fed lagoon. This is one of our favorite places to stay when were on the big island. ", " We spent 4 days here and had a great time! The resort is rather large and it really does take about a 15 minute walk to get from the parked car to the room, which did not bother us as the walk was enjoyable. We spent a full day at the lagoon, which was wonderful! There are sea turtles swimming in and out as well as sunning on the rocks. We went Snuba diving in the lagoon with Brian and his team - they were awesome and this was definitely our favorite part of our stay (we saw an eel and turtle swimming around as well as many fish). This resort has many features on site, which make it rather nice if you just want a \"lay-day\" from your hectic planned vacation. We were disappointed by the $25/day resort fee as well as the additional ~17/day for parking, especially considering we were unable to ever connect to the \"included internet\" as the signal was always weak. Also... we were woken every morning around 4a-5a from the birds chirping outside - they were incredibly loud in the Ocean Tower. ", " My honey and I absolutely LOVED everything about the Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island! The service was outstanding, our room overlooking the ocean was big, clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the beautiful artwork, lovely grounds and ease of getting around the 62 acre resort. Loved the dolphin lagoon. We got a great deal on our room as it was the off season (early Dec) and we got free valet service since they noticed I had a knee brace on my leg. We highly recommend this resort and can't wait to go back!!! ", " Great unique experiences for a family. Dolphins, sea turtles, great pools, a train and boats to ride. Loved our stay and the staff made it so great. The only downside is the price of food. Go during an off time and you can lessen the cost. ", " Looking at the mixed reviews I was expecting a tired old place but couldn't be HAPPIER!!! We booked an early check in and were here at 11am with room ready to go! We are in a great room right above the dolphin lagoon so we get to enjoy this superb view for a week! When we got in we undid the foldout chair and the bed is really too small for a teen. Oh no! I said- here's where it all goes wrong - but no! Called the desk and the friendly housekeeping had a large rollaway sent up within 20 minutes. Huge room, superb bathroom, cleverly designed. Stunningly beautiful views, ambling walkways (not far from anything) filled with art to restaurants - birds, dolphins, sea turtles. Could a holiday get any better? 6 days more to go. Heaven. Just woke from a great sleep on comfortable bed and opened the curtains... Aaaah, this is The Life! ", " We had a wonderful stay. All the staff we dealt with were helpful and friendly. The resort grounds are beautiful. There are lots of interesting works of art and landscaping to make a walk from point to point on the resort an experience in and of itself. As Hilton Gold, they upgraded us to the Dolphin Tower. Our kids loved the lagoon, the boat and train hotel transportation, and the abundance of sea turtles in the lagoon and by the waterfall. The activities are great for a family destination. The lagoon has an interesting variety of wildlife, but it's protected from currents, tides, and sharks. Our kids especially liked paddle boarding and kayaking at night with lights to see the aquatic animals.The kids also enjoyed the lei making class, and the ice cream shop by the lagoon. They give kids rubber wrist bands each time you eat at a restaurant on property, and when they accumulate six they get a free ice cream cone. The free ice cream we got on our visit from Shakra (sp?) may have been better than usual because the pool marketplace was closed during pool repairs. As others have noted, the meals are expensive here, but all but one of ours was high quality. Our room in the Dolphin Tower had an excellent ocean view. They rooms have screen doors so guests can listen to the waves at night without worrying about bugs. The room was a bit on the small side, but well appointed and sparkling clean each day. One thing the hotel may want to consider adding is a drying line in main tub. People use swimsuits here a lot and it would be nice to have some additional drying area. ", " We arrived at the Hilton Waikoloa Village resort on 11-30-2013 and were blown away at the beauty that greeted us as we pulled up to the main entrance. The hotel staff are phenomenall!!! The resort is absolute paradise from the amenities to the grounds to the people. The lush tropical setting is amazing!!!! The tram and boat rides around the resort are top notch!!!! If you are looking for a place to truly unwind and relax.....THIS IS IT!!! The pools and grounds are beautifully taken care of. You will never want for anything....the staff makes sure your visit is flawless!! The food is out of this world. Truly amazing experience!!! ", " Hilton was great, dolphin experience w/ Evan TERRIBLE, not worth it ! Great service otherwise, plan on walking a lot. Food and service very good, good shopping, bell and valet service excellent the Lagoon is a must. KPC restaurant excellent sun set view a must. ", " Our favorite resort when staying on Kona side of Big-Island \u2013 never falls short of meeting our expectations. Resort is exceptionally beautiful (and big) and has all the amenities one seeks at a resort (sunset dining, pools, lagoon to swim/snorkel, Spa, Shopping, etc.) when coming to relax and enjoy the Islands. Was given a room in the newly renovated Lagoon Towers and the beds are quite comfortable, nice view (ask for side of lagoon/ocean) and very quick walk to the lobby. Fast internet speed and Lagoon Tower is right next to Spa and the Gym (over 25 cardio and good selection of weight equipment). During our stay renovations were going on and the Lagoon tower pool and Italian/Chinese restaurants were closed. If you want a pool closer to your room ask to stay in the Ocean Tower, if the pool is not done.Tip 1: Ask for a high floor (6th is highest) if staying in the Lagoon Tower to get the entire beauty of the resort/ocean.Tip 2: If a Hilton Honors member (Gold and above) then you get to use the Spa (Hot Tub, Wet/Dry Sauna, Locker room) for free every day \u2013 well worth it and we used it every morning to start our day.Tip 3: Snorkel the lagoon early in the morning (as sun is just beginning to light the lagoon) and swim next to the waterfall \u2013 that\u2019s where the turtles are (we swam with four turtles for an hour). Lots of fish, eels and turtles to enjoy. One turtle slleps inside the wall next to the waterfall so look closely.Tip 4: There is supermarket in the Shops close to the resort \u2013 also a very good food court with a fantastic Thai Restaurant (Lemon Grass) worth a stop. Also recommend Merriamans Mediterranean Restaurant for good food at a reasonable price.Tip 5: Go to either end of the property for one of the best sunsets you will see in Hawaii. Also, drive up to top of Mauna Kea (where the observatories are) and see the sunset\u2026then do not leave. Wait for it to get completely dark and then step outside, with a blanket/jacket, to see the most phenomenal night skies you will ever see. We do this every time here and take the rental car\u2026.so it is OK. When done come down to the half-way point and look in the telescopes the local people bring for tourists to look through. If you do a tour, be advised they come down long before it gets dark\u2026\u2026that is why we always drive. ", " I would recommend this hotel to my friends, to get good time, because it is fun for every one!We really got good and enjoyable time. It is hotel and zoo and museum together. I can say, it little be expensive, but for Hawaii and on vacation it is ok. ", " If you're heading to Kona for a little R&R, you can't go wrong with this place. It has to be the BEST place to stay in Waikoloa, and the greater Kona area. It's about a good 20-25 minute drive north of the airport, but well worth it. The resort consists of 3 towers (Lagoon, Palace & Ocean) spread out over 64 acres. This place is so large, that they have their own Disneyland-like monorail to shuttle guests around the property. They also offer a boat taxi to get you back and forth around the grounds. You can go swimming with the dolphins, or canoe on their man-made lagoon. There were at least two pools with slides for the entire family. Personally, I think the Lagoon Tower is the best one for families. If you're traveling w/o kids, the Ocean Tower will probably suit your fancy better.They even have their own rental car place on site, not to mention several eateries/restaurants and various clothing and gift shops. Do be prepared for the sticker shock though, because the paid amenities are quite hight even by Hawaii standards! ", " This property is very large, like a small city. There is monorail transportation within the resort, with numerous swimming pools and restaurants. The room was well appointed and very clean, and shuttle service is available at a small fee to go to the local shopping center, although it is close enough to walk. Many local tour companies also pick up from this hotel if you want to take day trips. Very nice atmosphere overall. ", " We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in connection with our honeymoon in Hawaii. This is truly a fantastic property. You can explore the territory for days and the walking passage connecting the main building with other parts of the complex is like a museum. If you do not feel like 15 mins walk, there is an option of a monorail or a boat! You can swim or snorkel in the beautiful lagoon enjoying the company of exotic fish and green turtles. We have already decided to come back next year for a week's stay and cannot wait. ", " I believe the Hilton Waikoloa Village is the best hotel in Hawaii it is great for everyoneIt is great for families to get away for vacation if you're going to go on any hotel on the big Island of Hawaii go to the Hilton Waikoloa Village!!! ", " Great experience in August 2013. Stayed there for 10 days. #1 rated resort on this island. First-class all the way. It's as big as a small town village. Everything you need is there. Ensure that you eat at the restaurant at sunset, worth the price. If you can afford this hotel, (Hawaii is not cheap), this is the one. Not for those who don't like to walk, this place is huge. See YouTubes on this resort. ", " We had a great time at this resort. The resort is huge but the grounds are beautiful. We had a cabana room in Lagoon Towers. The first night our cabana room was right in front of the Dolphin area and the outside area seemed a little confined. We switched the next day to a cabana room on the pool side and loved it. We were able to walk out of our patio door to the pool. Also the rooms on this side are closer to the elevator. The walk to the parking lot from the Lagoon Towers is an easy one if you go through the Spa entrance and then through the tennis courts.We loved walking the paths through the resort. If you want to get from the Ocean Towers to Lagoon Towers it is shorter to walk the paths along the ocean vs the paths connecting the buildings. We ate dinner at all of the restaurants and was surprised the food was as good as it was for being such a large resort.Our first full day we went to Walmart in Kona to buy snacks and drinks and a few souvenirs. We didn't discover the Marketplace in the Queens Shopping Center until 2 days before we left. It is a grocery store and they have pretty much everything you would need at reasonable prices. We packed a soft-sided cooler in our luggage to be able to take cold drinks and snacks to whatever beach we visited for the day.If you have kids there is plenty to do to keep them busy. We have a 3 year old, but travelled without her, she would have had a great time at this resort.We went the week before Thanksgiving week and it was perfect weather and not crowded. It was starting to fill up the day we were leaving. ", " Georgeous and relaxing location. Ukulele lessons... amazing! Very kind staff. Very good ice cream. Dolohins experience canot be missed! Great! Laggon very rich of fishes and turtles. You don't have to go snorkeling outside. ", " Absolutley AMAZING....No complaints..The pools, Spa, Grounds, Tram, Boat, Dolphins, Rooms, Food, All perfect...For the perfect vacation travel to the Big Island and stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, you will not be disappointed.Personal Acknowledgemnts:Front Desk Team was AMAZING...Friendly and personable Housekeeping - Clean and Well Kept guest roomsThis is a MUST in your vacation plans. ", " The resort was very clean and beautiful. Good staff and concierge. There are good activities for kids as well. I do recommend to make sure you rent a car from airport. The resort is farther than you think. Also, consider buying water,beer, fresh fruit or snacks for your room beforehand as food is very expensive there. There is not much to do outside the resort. Waterfalls, volcanos and other sites are on the other side of the island. As I said, the resort is beautiful, safe and the staff was great.Overall, a very good experience. ", " Stayed at this hotel for the second time for three days. Pleasant accommodations in the Ocean Tower ocean front room.View of the putting courses and ocean were great. Train was prompt to shuttle you throughout. Luau was fantastic and very professional. The talented emcee reminded us of Don Ho. Nearby ABC store for inexpensive food items..lagoon pools with hot tubs and waterfalls are scenic and recreational. All pools were scenic and well landscaped.. Highly recommend staying here .. Works best for those who are mobile and like to explore all areas and for those who are content to stay in one spot without exploring and lounge by a pool. It would be helpful if the hotel described each pool station and other attractions in more detail in the room guides... ", " Excellent hotel and property with unique train and boat service between areas. A great pity hotel is not closer to home....but its worth the journey Japanese and Chinese restaurants are well worth a visit. Breakfast in the Big Restaurant is always a wonderful experience ", " Resort was wonderful. Restaurants are expensive but if you go outside the resort you can find some reasonably priced. resort is big so you do need to travel around by Tram. Rooms are a good size and the grounds are very well kept. I felt the cost was very reasonable for the quality of the whole resort. ", " This really is a Tropical Paradise! Food is very expensive on the complex but we took the shuttle (two dollars per person each way) to Queens Marketplace where food is really good value and there is a food market. We also bought the discount card for 29.95 (plus tax) which gives 10% off food and beverages and came out ahead. Emma Z said she had no freebies - we did! We stayed 6 nights and got the 7th free and we also had free tickets for the Luau, which would have cost us 233 dollars! Probably would not have bothered otherwise. Took a Roberts' tour of the island which was great and when we booked at the Hilton activity centre, we were given a free bag (admittedly advertising Hilton). Our room in Ocean Tower was comfortable and spacious. It was pretty central for everything and had an adult-only pool. The only downside was the deafening birds outside the door at 4 a.m. every morning! A great place if you just want to swim and soak up the sun. Activities are expensive. We considered the breakfast buffet to be expensive but better value than a la carte. Food was cold every day! They tried to put it right but I gave up and had a cooked to order omelette instead, which was excellent. Plentiful choice of different breakfast items. Waiting staff mostly very friendly and efficient. ", " The hilton waikoloa village is allot of fun as they offer more than just rooms. The have a trolley that escorts you around the village for shopping and site seeing, a real nice outdoor water park for swimming and hot tubing, an real nice park with lots of statues, beach access and so much more. ", " WOW this is the best over all hotel I have been to, Feed the Dolphins, swim with them, enjoy and out door meal just watching, accommodation first class. Close to other sites all up the Kona coast line. about 7 miles to Kona town. ", " We stayed for six nights in the Nai'a Dolphin Suite in the Lagoon Tower (thanks HHonors points!!!). It was hard to find recent info or reviews on this one (there is a youtube video and one TripAdvisor mention). It is a two stories room, and you enter on the second floor (main ground), although there is a first floor (the dark hallway) exit where your room key will not work. The exit on first floor opens right to the ice maker, which is nice!! The second floor entry is at the top of the stairs with a small landing for shoes / bags, and then it opens into the main bedroom - which is a king size bed with both sheer and blackout shades on the sliding glass doors - which the doors open onto a two person seating area / balcony with chairs and a small round table - the bedroom bathroom is very updated and BIG with both a tub, separate shower, two sinks, and a toilet behind a door, and comfy bathroom lighting and separate temperature control - the balance of the bedroom has a big double door closet (including the safe) and a 40 inch tv / playstation / blu ray player on top of a six drawer chest for clothes. The downstairs area has a two story open area (lots of lights) with a large 4 foot circular table (good for putting common stuff on) and two double doors to the outside area (all glass without shades - so be forewarned about people seeing in) with the doors an accordion like pull in variety (heavy not for kids). The balance of the downstairs includes a sitting area, a desk area, a second bathroom and small kitchen. The sitting area has a couch (pulls out for a comfy queen size sleeper), four chairs, a 40 inch tv / cd player / playstation, and a tea cart on wheels (for food or whatever). The desk area is a large six foot by 2.5 foot dark desk with lots of electrical plugs and a bookcase behind it with local Hawaiian books. The bathroom is an updated single sink (hammered metal beautiful), toilet, and large shower with a sitting area (and two shower heads!). The kitchen is small, with a small (and old) fridge that might accommodate 30 cans of soda, a microwave, coffee maker, lots of grill tools, dishes, pots, pans, silverware, and the coffee fixins, a sink / faucet, and an electric stovetop (two spots) - the whole area is maybe 6 foot by 5 foot.The outside area (past the two double accordion doors) is THE highlight. Dinner table with seating for 8, another two single chairs, another three XL comfy chairs, and a bench with cushions for seating another 7+ folks. The whirlpool seats 5 comfortably, and has good jets, underwater lighting, and steps in / out, with a timing controller. This balcony overlooks the dolphin pool (on the Lagoon grill side), so you can see all the dolphin trainer action (and figure out which trainer cares more for them than others), all the dolphin interactions that others are having (lots of shows!), and you hear them snorting / blowing / playing all night and morning. There are steps that go down towards the dolphins, but you are prohibited from going down them - and you are asked to not be noisy for the dolphins. Note also that the balcony has a fence that is tall, so you need to stand to see the dolphins. From the balcony you can hear softly, the ocean waves coming into the bay, and you can see them. You have a nice view of the lagoon (snorkeling and play toys) too. A propane BBQ grill is setup with three burners and large grill space (six good size NY strips for example) and a top warming rack - awesome for staying in the room and cooking (bring some of your own garlic powder / pepper / etc) - and the Hilton provides good tools (flippers and tongs).FYI laundry in Lagoon Tower had three washers and four dryers - $2 a pop. The DVDNow privilege is nice for recent release DVD's, but we never found any playstation games.Getting anywhere at the resort takes time - about four minutes walk time from the suite to the lagoon or the pool, about six minutes to the lobby, and a minute to the Waikoloa coffee shop (friendly staff!!!). Walking from the suite to Ocean Tower (where the Hawaiian cultural activities are) took us about 17 minutes walking across the property (and is advertised as 20 minutes via tram - most of our tram rides were longer). Tip - exit through the Kohala spa past the tennis courts to get to the self parking lot area faster!! It is a very big property with lots of non-native Japanese art. I personally would probably avoid Ocean Tower (we have stayed there before) due to it's distance to the lobby and parking, especially if the tram is having problems (twice during our visit) or the boats are not running (they seem to start in the afternoon) - Palace Tower is still a good hike but doable, but Lagoon Tower is close in.My pre-teen started getting bored with the pool and lagoon after five days of on / off action (we were doing other things off property while here). Tip - book a cabana on the Friday before a weekend to ensure you get one - the hotel advertises for locals to visit, and it can get busy. Cabanas come with water service, cold towels, and clean towels when needed (its still easy to get your own). The lagoon toys area (stand up paddleboards, kayaks, etc.) occasionally had $30 all-day and $40 all-day pricing, so figure out if you want to spend six hours there in one day, or spread it over multiple.Diamond members get: free Hawaiian cultural activities, a $10 voucher each day, free local calls, 20% discount at the lagoon (excludes bulk purchases).Enjoy!! ", " WoW what a great hotel to stay and relax by the Dolphin pools or even a great meal priced just right watching all the Dolphins being feed and preforming, the building is fantastic and the train takes you too your room. Swim in the large lake like pools with the turtles( if you are lucky ) you can join in and feed the Dolphins for a fee. Over all a great place too stay, on the Hawaii Island near Kona airport with shuttle provided. Enjoy Alf ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa this past weekend doing a site visit for a future conference. The property is breathtaking...from the huge pools which accommodate all to the dolphin pool on site! KPC restaurant on property is not to be missed! The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. Whether your considering this property for business or pleasure...it is a definite recommend! ", " I stood in line at check-in while all three Front Desk Clerks were busy helping a bunch of cry babies! The first couple, from what I saw with flower necklaces looked to be Newlyweds. The guy was trying to get a free-upgrade!! REALLY!? If you want an Ocean view then book an Ocean view! When the Clerk offered a part view he flew off the handle! The other couple seemed to be frequent loyal customers. That lady kept rattling on about getting an upgrade to the new Tower. This other guy was complaining about paying for parking! Come on people! Do your damn homework and PAY for that Ocean view room! Don't demand it! I was pretty irritated because I booked and paid for the room I got when I checked in. The Clerk Sammie who helped me was nice and helpful even after having to deal with the jerk in front of me. The Tram is slow but who cares. Most of America needs to walk anyway! Please book the room you want so you don't make people like me wait in line and listen to all of the none sense! Hotel is big, parking is far but the grounds and room are clean. Food could be better at the Boathouse Restaurant. Employees are nice. ", " From the step through the front door until the final departure , the stay was wonderful, the staff was terrific sand the accommodations were a dream. You can enjoy the pool. spa, walks along the ocean, dining in fine restaurants and also relax. A great experience, a wonderful vacation and we can not wait until we have the opportunity to return to the Waikaloa Hilton another time. ", " This hotel has so much to offer! Pools, comfortable rooms, delicious food, gorgeous views, and a lagoon pool where you can swim with TURTLES! Check out the dolphin pool where you can swim with them or watch them play all night long. The spa offers oceanfront massages - try Lomi Lomi it's amazing. Highly recommend this hotel. ", " Hilton Waikoloa This place is a MUST STAY!! This place is truly magical.

", " This is an amazing resort with everything you could want...pools, lagoon,dolphins,boat ride, train, art,spa, water slides...it has something for the whole family..all ages. We took the Lei making class that was included in the resort fee and it was great and we came away with a beaautiful white orchid lei...and local sight seeing and restaraunt input from the teacher. ", " We loved our stay here! It was so welcoming. We participated in some of the many Hawaiian classes offered (most of them were free) like Hula class, Lei making, and learning about native Hawaii. Whether we were taking a night walk along the torch-lit beachside or snorkeling with turtles in the lagoon, this resort was like a world of its own. It is a huge property with so many quiet corners to have a swim, read a book, or just relax in the sun. ", " We stayed October 15 thru the 22nd and still did not see everything this resort has to offer. The dinning was great and from Mike at the front desk to Pat at the Luau everyone was helpful and kind. It is a lot of walking but the tram was timely and easy to use. I would go back in a minute. Thanks to everyone. ", " We stayed for our 40th anniversary. The hotel gave us a bottle of champagne in our room upon our arrival. The stay was a wonderful present. Would love to return, and plan to give a night as a great gift to someone else. ", " LOVE the big island - love this resort. We had stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki a couple of years ago in Honolulu which was fantastic as well.This resort upgraded us to a huge double lanai suite - GORGEOUS! overlooking the dolphins for our 25th wedding anniversary....stunning views!The grounds are incredible truly beautiful and the art work that adorns the walls...its like being at a museum. The staff was always friendly as is the whole island - tons to do and see.Although Honolulu offers more and close by than the Big Island - this resort is worth going to - one of the more beautiful resorts we have ever stayed at. ", " We stayed in room 4311 so we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. Good exercise. The food is a little expensive I think they should have some smaller portions available for those who don't want to eat that much at one time. I also think they should have a small microwave in each room. ", " We just got back from our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village January 29 - February 2! We were very happy with the Hilton! Yes, it is expensive! It is a large resort, but I didn't feel like it was near as bad as people's reviews! We stayed on the 5th floor of the Lagoon tower! Upon checking in, we were told this tower had the newest updated rooms! We had booked a garden view room, but our room ended up with views over the dolphin area, snorkeling lagoon, & ocean! I don't think the hotel was at full capacity at the time of year we were there, which was nice! The room we had was a suite that had living room with sofa bed, wet bar, kitchen table, 2nd room with 2 double beds & a very large nice bathroom! The room was great! To get to our room we either took the tram or walked! The walk was not that long at all I thought! We took the boat once, just for a tour of the resort! We actually enjoyed walking around the property & didn't mind the chirping birds in the trees! We are from Wisconsin, so we cherished every second we could walking in shorts in nice weather! The pools were very nice at the hotel, but they were cold! We were a little disappointed that we couldn't swim in them more! Later in the week we went to Maui & the pools at the Fairmont were a lot warmer than at the Hilton! While at the Hilton, we mostly utilized the snorkeling lagoon! It was great for our kids, because it protected, calm, & safe! People say it is manmade, but it is natural. Everything comes & goes freely from it from the ocean! There were lots of sea turtles! We also saw eel, small Baracuda, box fish, & lots of other fish! We went to Snorkel Bob's to rent or snorkel equipment for our entire vacation! Very easy & cheaper than the resort! We went to the Buffet Breakfast everyday at the Hilton! It was very good! Breakfasts in Hawaii always rock! My only complaint was the Breakfast buffet was overrun by a China conference group! We bought prepaid breakfast for 2 adults & then also bought the food discount card! Our youngest was free at breakfast, so overall the breakfast buffet was a fairly decent deal compared to prices in Hawaii! Go to the grocery store & buy snacks, drinks, & lunch items for during the day! It will save you money! The Hilton Waikoloa Village is further away from the action of the Kona Coast! Outside the hotel it is very bare & sparse! We spent one day at Volcano National Park! We took the Northern Route to get there & it was a 2 1/2 hour drive from the hotel! If you go, stay until dusk to see the lava glow from the Jaggar Visitor Center! We also went to a snorkeling local spot called 2 steps! Great snorkeling! Look for the natural 2 steps off the lava rock where people are entering & exiting the water! We also liked the downtown Kailua-Kona! We ate at Huggo's On The Rocks! It was good! Overall a great stay at the Hilton! Going to the Big Island was nice, but I think once is enough! We like Maui the best! ", " Was amazed by this resort. You walk through a musem to get to your room, or you can take the tram. Plenty of things to do.. plenty of pools, dolphin training, sea turtles sight, expensive restaurants, shops with expensive souvenirs, water and juice available in hallways for everyone, comfortable beds, noisy birds at night, no beach access. ", " This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Everything is beyond excellent and the surroundings like a theme part done with style and beauty. The dolphins are an added bonus that you may never see in a hotel anywhere but here. I can not say enough about having a Luau here. We have attended many luaus in Hawaii and this one had the best food, the best service and the best show ever. We stay here every time we come to the big Island and we come here every other year. The Chinese restaurant lunch Dim Sum is super and all the restaurants that we have eaten at, including the coffee shop down by the Ocean Towers have never disappointed us. Best hotel experience anywhere! ", " This is a great place for families! We stayed in ocean tower and the feeling of waking up every morning to the sound and sight of waves is indescribable. The activities within the resort are awesome but it does take awhile to get from one end of the property to the other. food was also very $$$ but thats an issue everywhere in Hawaii. The dolphin bay was AMAZING. ", " Very nice hotel. Bring walking shoes, as it is a big property. We did the dolphin experience with my 4-year old at Dolphin Quest--how convenient to have it on the property. So nice to see the dolphins every day! ", " It's hard to decide whether the Hilton Waikoloa Village is a theme park, museum or resort. Every step you take there is something new to take in including masses of well presented art works and natural or man-made wonders to view. A train or boat takes you around the resort as it is so big. It took us 15 minutes to walk to the lobby! Well worth the stay. ", " From the dolphins on property to jacuzzis in caves to fabulous antiquities through out the resort to browse at on the walk to your room we have never been more impressed with a place to stay. If you don't want to walk you can take a tram or a gondola. Fond memories that have yet to be beat! ", " If you are looking for a family resort to enjoy this island this is the place to go. Great selection of restaurants and activities for all ages. Near the property are several other restaurants and stores if you want to stay local. 30 mins to Kona and all that town has to offer. You are near some of the best snorkeling the state has to offer. I recommend you contact tropical flights for a scenic tour.  ", " Totally Awesome! A little on the pricey side but well worth it! The facility and staff made this a wonderful family vacation. Their help with local attractions and local spots for leisure relaxation was truly appreciated. Now throw in the \"Dolphin Quest\", which our daughter is still all smiles about, and your trip is complete. ", " This lovely hotel never fails to provide a fun-filled family vacation. Definitely better for the older kids (i.e., able to run around the expansive grounds comfortably). My two teenagers spent the week at the tennis club, great pro, excellent lessons and lots of fun! ", " I've heard about the hotel but a great deal landed us there for a weekend getaway. What a pleasant surprise! The hotel was impressive, beautiful, but the best part was the service! Everyone was pleasant, accommodating and helpful! Being a local, we were treated well and offered a kamaaina discount where available. There are so many activities at the hotel we didn't get to them all. Oh well, guess we just have to go back again! Mahalo for a memorable visit! ", " We had a wonderful time at this massive resort! We arrived in the night and were a little concerned with the rather poor welcome, train to the room and the fact that there was little/no choice of food after 9:30pm.... and then we woke up the next morning :)The place is amazing! You can swim with turtles (first thing in the morning is best), watch the dolphins (there was one just born when we were there), walk along the cost to the Marriott and Lava Lava bar which is beautiful and it's a great base for the rest of the island.Things to note:It's expensive and you have little choice of going elsewhere if you don't have a car so budget for it!There are extra charges for parking, the gym, breakfast is not included, snorkel gear has to be rented etcWe chose to do the 90min hilton timeshare presentation for $100 and money off a helicopter tour. It wasn't pressured, we said no and got the gifts :)Be prepared to walk around - once you learn the short cuts you don't need to take the train. We only did on the first night.All in all I'd defiantly recommend - loved it, for such a massive resort it really felt like it had character :) ", " Not sure how to say this, but I am not aware of any other hotel that provided more value than this establishment. The suite was spacious, immaculate as well as very personable. The buffet breakfast was two meals in one with all the food well presented. The grounds were well maintained. And the staff was accommodating. An experience worth repeating, for sure. ", " We booked our reservation as a surprise for my sister who had flown 13 hours to see me. My husband notice a problem with our reservation and contacted Sally Root, who went out of her way to give us the most incredible two day stay. We stayed in the Na'ia Suite, overlooking the Dolphin Quest lagoons. It was magical and a once in a lifetime experience. The customer service was the best we have ever experienced in Hawaii. The room was absolutely amazing and better than we had expected. Highly recommend one of the suites overlooking the lagoon. Will definitely be returning!!! ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village from October 1st through October 10th. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and I recommend that. We had an ocean view and a view of the Dolphin lagoon. We loved the grounds, and really enjoyed the art collection. Nearby Kings Shops and Queens marketplace are very nice as well. We did a lot of venturing out around the island. The pools were very nice. The restaurants were nice as well. Any time we needed anything, they came right away with it. Overall a great place and a great value. ", " You will want to stay and enjoy the resort. I wish I had more than three days on the big island. That was my error when scheduling my trip to other islands. We wanted to drive to the volcano, coffee plantations, waterfalls and everything else folks see on the Big island. The resort was going to be just a place to sleep, but wow we really enjoyed the amenities and wished we had planned to stay longer. From our lanai we could see the sunset, watch golfers on a green and enjoy being alone. There are several pools and lagoons to snorkel, swim and paddle surf. The resort is tied together with a train and boat for transportation between buildings. You will not feel crowded. Even if you don\u2019t stay there, visit for sunset. If you want to enjoy waves on an ocean beach, you can drive to many locations. This is a rocky beach, sandy beach is on very nice lagoons. ", " This is the largest and most beautiful resort we have every stayed in. Would not even have to leave the resort the entire visit. Everything is available right on the property. The staff was not just pleasant but very helpful. We had an excellent lunch with a guacamole dip made right at our table. Was delicious! Trams and boats available for transportation to the many restaurants and activities in the resort. The views are magnificent. The only negative thought I have is we did not stay longer. There is quite a bit to do both on the resort and around the Island. Unfortunately for us the Federal Government problems kept us from visiting some of the National Sites, especially the Volcano, but guess we will just have to make another trip to this Island and will definitely make reservations at this resort again. ", " This is our sixth time at this hotel. It gets better every time and has always been great! The rooms, the people, the facility, the pools, the diverse activity's, the spa, the dolphins, the food, the scenery, the trains and boats had enough? No there is more! I have been to over 76 countries, countless resorts and cruises and this place is the best in the world for couples, families, fun and smiles. ", " If you are going to the Kona coast on the big island of Hawaii, I would recommend staying at the Hiltion Waikoloa Village. My two grandsons had the time of their life there - from swimming with big turtles in their man made lake to riding a train or boat to get to their room to going down slides into the various pools. It is a beautiful resort and is a vacation unto itself. ", " We stayed 2 nights at the Hilton W. while attending Hawaiian Taste of the Range. Our check in was speedy and our special needs were met to a T. Not only did we receive and handicapped room, it was close to the elevator but positioned so we didn't hear the elevator or its occupants!!We are already planning a return visit in the Spring. Esp as the Starbucks was only 2 minutes away. ", " We stayed here at the best time of the year, October of 2013. Absolutely no crowds & no waiting to go down the numerous water slides:) We arrived late on a Tuesday night & stayed till the following Wednesday. It was very clean & the place was full of great beautiful walk ways. The landscaping was breathtaking & the food was oh so satisfying!! The people who worked there were as friendly as they come...especially Treena ( Probably spelled her name wrong:( at Waters Edge. She would greet me every morning & say \"Good morning Mrs. Payne...I couldn't believe she remembered my name every single morning...I only told her the first day. She was awesome & had the true Hawaiian spirit:). The Hilton was most accommodating, even if you have a late departing flight. They either offer a late check out or give you another room to take a nap & shower if you need it. We will defiantly be staying here again & you should too!!! Just don't forget to purchase the 10% off card because things are very expensive but that card helps!!! Also check out the time share presentation for many reasons...A. It's good knowledge in case you are interested in buying one. B. because they give you $100 to spend at the Village &C. best of all you get a whole bunch of money off all your excursions!!! Sometimes $50-$75 off!!! So it's defiantly worth the 90 minutes of your time!!So this place defiantly gives you the opportunity to save but be careful, it still is expensive!!! I recommend eating in Kona or if you want to stay on the resort, the Landing Catina Mexican restaurant was awesome!!!Get Emma to be your server, she is great, the 2nd time we went there we told her she didn't have to make the Guacamole at our table but it was cool to see the 1st time:) Another awesome Restaurant was Donna & Tony's Pizza...we are from the jersey shore & are very picky about our pizza & it was delicious!! The Chinese restaurant right up stairs is another winner!!! So all in all the food kept us full & satisfied!!The resort also kept us busy...snorkeling with large sea turtles & shopping for shoes & souvenirs was also fun. But the best was taking the little boat around & around the resort...there is also a Monorail for continence. The only down fall about this resort is it does not have a beach:(. Since the Big Island is the newest of the Hawaiian Islands it doesn't have many beaches to begin with but the resort is right on the water & instead of a beach it is covered with lava & coral rocks...which are white & black. My husband & I wrote our names with the contrasting colors:). Plus there is a beautiful walk way down that beach, leading to an actual beach...maybe a half a mile down. Next to that beach is a great restaurant called Lava Lava with great entertainment!!! If you don't want to walk all the way back you can catch the trolly at the Marriott to bring you back to the Hilton...or make a pit stop at King's Shops, full of great stores & restaurants. This place is paradise on paradise island:). You hardly have to leave the resort. The resort alone is 62 acres but including all the golf courses, King's Shops, Queen's Market Place, & time share areas...it's over 200 acres. But we did leave & went up to Waimea to do a little grocery shopping & site see. Kohola to Na'alapa Stables (the 2 girls I think we're named Kara & Jorden were a great time & took us on an adventurous private ride through the mountains). Then of course we went to Hilo but on the way we visited Rainbow Falls & Akaka Falls...both beautiful!! So my advise is: spend your vacation here!!! You can find a great deal in late Sept-early Nov & do the other things I listed & you'll have one of the most memorable vacations of your life!!! Thank you Hilton Waikoloa Village!!! We'll be back soon!!! ", " Me and my partner went here for our first holiday together. We was Exeter at the airport by and air conditioned mini bus that took us straight to our hotel. The hotel was beautiful, the guests and staff all full of smiles. Reading reviews before we went we was aware that our room maybe quite far from reception and breakfast. However we felt it was a leisurely walk every morning and didn't often get the shuttle. For a $ each way me and my other half visited the king and queens market daily! with beautiful shops and unique gifts we loved are spending out time. At the resort we spent a few days in the lagoon snorkelling with the beautiful sea turtles and fish, the lovely sun loungers was a great way to dry off. We also spent a day with the dolphins, what an experience the staff were very informative and the dolphins were well looked after and happy. On another day we also went to the spa. Although a little pricey the experience was great, I had a French pedicure which was done free hand. In reception every morning I made friends with a pink cockatoo called butterscotch. Such a friendly and beautiful creature. Throughout our stay the staff were always more than happy to help. Especially the breakfast staff. The big island breakfast we consumed every morning was lovely. So much choice with an omelette bar, breads and cooked items. However for us English there wasn't any baked beans. On our last day we had to be checked out of our room by mid day and our flight wasn't until later. However, they looked after our luggage then let us use an empty room to get showered and dressed before we went. The location of the hotel was okay. A short walk to the nearest beach but not very close to much else. Over all an amazing experience and we hope one day to return. ", " This was our first time vacationing in Hawaii. We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for seven days in September. We are Hilton Diamond Members and used reward points for this stay. We were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary.Ryan Tomm, guest experience manager, went above and beyond to make our vacation not only the vacation of the lifetime but perfect in everyway. Our vacation exceeded our expectations due to his great customer service and attention to small details. We travel a great deal and Ryan was the best guest experience manager we have dealt with at Hilton. We checked-in without any problems and our luggage was delivered to our room promptly. We stayed in two different rooms at the Lagoon Tower. Both suites had been renovated, were roomy, comfortable, in perfect condition and had great individual room features. The Lagoon Tower is close to the pools, lobby, shops and the spa and was very convenient. The amenities for the room were from the Kohloa Spa. Everything we ordered from housekeeping was delivered timely and the room was serviced and replenished daily. The grounds for the resort itself were immaculate and beautiful. The pools were spotless. We had no problems finding chairs or shaded areas by the pool in September. Also, the water temperature for the pool was fine. We did not find the size of the resort to be a problem.As a Diamond member, we were entitled to use the Kohloa Spa facilities without charge each day of our stay. The Spa has excellent facilities: a dry sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi. We used the valet parking for our rental car. Sheldon was helpful many times with directions and suggestions. We never had to wait long for our car to be delivered to us. The Valet service was very efficient. Luggage pick-up and check-out also went smoothly. We had a great stay and are already planning our return trip!Thank you Ryan Tomm and the rest of the staff at the Hilton Waikoloa for a great vacation! ", " We stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club for a week and had to checkout at 10am on our last day. Since we had no car, we needed something to do for the whole day before our 10:30pm flight back to Chicago. We paid $160 for a room to use and access to the pools for the day (10am-6pm) at the Hilton Waikoloa. It was money well spent since we had our 4yr old daughter in tow. The service, from the Front Desk to the Bell Service to the wait staff, was very attentive and informative. The tram and boats to take you to the various towers didn't run very frequently (there was usually a 10-15min wait) so we walked most of the time. The grounds are well-kept, immaculate and interesting with various art pieces adorning the public walkways. The Kohala pools/slidesby our room in the Ocean Tower were perfect for little children (mostly 1-9 yr olds). We ate at 3 different places in the resort. The poke bowl in the cafe by the main pool area was excellent and at a good price. The ice creams at Shaka Cone were tasty...i loved the Kona Coffee Toffee! Be sure to book a reservation at Kamuela Provision Company at 5:45pm for a great view of the stunning sunset. Hubby and I both had the Ono special there (fish topped with crab and lobster mix served over a bed of pickled cucumbers and nori mashed potatoes with 3 poached shrimp)...so delicious and actually too much food for me to finish. The day use room was just a regular room with a king size bed, so it was perfect for the 3 of us to rest and shower up after 5 hours in the pool. The only problem we had was that there were only 2 bath towels in the room. Overall, it was time and money well spent for our last day on the Big Island. I would highly recommend this to anyone in the same dilemma of having a very late flight departure. ", " The hotel exceeded our expectations....the room is a good value, but be prepared for the extras....many rooms are a long walk from the lobby but there is a tram available if you are patient. The food and restaurants are superb. We stayed a week, and wish it could have been longer....it is an excellent place for families with children or without. ", " Admittedly we did not pay to stay or visit, we merely free loaded while training for ironman, but the main lagoon and pool area are awesome, there's some nice bars by the pools and the facilities look fantastic. Great service by the staff, will look to stay there in the future ", " Your experience will be far and away improved by staying in the Rainbow tower in an ocean suite. Absolutely perfect views South & West and perfectly private. You must try if going with a significant other, and opt for the deluxe sweet, which has two balconies. Your only problem will be leaving the room. ", " It's good if you like to swim. Staff is all so friendly. But, restaurant are pricey. If your hungry you'll spend the money. Need to go about 1 mile out to queens market. It's such a great hotel. I've been there in 2006 and had to go back. ", " We stayed in Hilton Waikoloa Village for 3 days. We were very pleased that our room was upgraded to a room with fantastic ocean view. Room was big, very clean and cozy. We also received free continental breakfast and bottled water because of our gold status. The hotel looks like a museum. You will find numerous art collections along the hall way. Staffs are very friendly. Overall, this is a very nice hotel! ", " Went there last october as part of our honeymoon. The property is huge so its nice in a way that you can explore even if your just in your hotel, it maybe bad for some (not to us) coz as i said its huge so have to walk a bit to get where you want to go. there is a tram inside the hotel but we didnt really use it as we'd like to walk instead. the grounds on th hotel and around the hotel is well kept and you get a very nice view of the ocean, you can just bring a mat lay it on the green grass by the ocean and have a little family or couple picnic and relax which is i think amazing. they also have a lot of variety of restaurants inside of the hotel and a bar aswell, we were only able to try out their breakfast menu since we' like to experience more of the local foods in the area, i did love it when we had breakfast there, no complaints. i believe this hotel is amazing if you have a family and kids as you dont have to go outside and explore since you can already explore while you are in the hotel and your kids will already enjoy inside the hotel as it has a variety of pools and lake and tons of activities you can do. for couples it is also great i believe because when we went there the place wasnt too crowded, we also got upgraded to an oceanfront view room which was very very nice, you can hear the waves crashing down the shore which is so relaxing. i loved it! based from our experience i would give this hotel a definite 5 star and we'll definitely go back again! Staff was great, hotel was great , the experince was great!thank you guys! ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikaloa for 8 nights back in March as part of a 16 night holiday to Hawaii. Stayed in a resort room in the Ocean Tower. Room was of good size and very clean with some ocean views, but starting to show some signs of wear and tear. Resort staff were friendly and helpful. We tried all of the restaurants in the resort and all were to a very good standard with efficient service. Our 5 year old son loved the canal boat and train to get to and from our room each day. The pools and ocean lagoon were great for swimming, but if you are a beach person, probably not the place for you as there is no beach at the resort, other than a man made lagoon. That said, a most enjoyable stay. ", " The 64-acre Hilton Waikoloa is a sprawling property with great views and gorgeous museum pieces (or replicas). You don't really feel like you're staying at a hotel, you just want to wander and look at the pieces that the developer has placed throughout the property, in theme with the towers. It's beautiful! The staff is very nice, too. One caveat: The shuttle to & from the airport needs to be ordered 24 hours in advance. ", " This hotel is an adventure within it's self. You can take a boat or a transit to your building. Shops are a not too far from the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. One thing me and my boyfriend dislike, there's only one elevator. ", " So why explore the island when the Hilton has everything to make your stay perfect? Because the Big Island is worth exploration! However, the Hilton makes sure you could be completely satisfied remaining on site for your entire stay. Two family pools with water slides, waterfalls, and hot tubs, a natural ocean fed lagoon with sandy entrance, a dolphin habitat where you can swim with the dolphins, white tipped reef sharks, restaurants scattered all over the property with beautiful views, transportation across the resort by tram or skiffs, and the most beautiful sunsets. There are also wild birds, a game room, children's programs, three options for living accommodations, and meandering pathways through perfectly manicured gardens. Golf options seem endless, shopping is right across the road, and there is even a chapel on site if it is needed. Any excursions you want to try can be booked right from the hotel as well. There is also a rental car agency on site. We stayed in the Tower Palace which is the central building. The rooms were a bit outdated, but very clean and offered plenty of room for my husband and I. Overall we were very satisfied. I posted a few pictures. We had a garden/golf course view since we did not plan to stay in our room much while in Hawaii. We had the buffet breakfast every morning while staying here, and it was excellent. My only complaint would be the lack of variety from day to day. There was an omelet station that was very nice depending on who was cooking that day. It ranged from good to excellent. Stop by even if you don't eat omelets. It is like watching art being made. There is a traditional breakfast station with scrambled eggs, pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, and biscuits and gravy. There is an asian station with seaweed salad options and Miso Soup and Fish. Fresh fruit, fresh juices, cereals, and bagels and breads are also offered. The cost is $30 per person so you will feel like you want to eat enough for breakfast and lunch at that price. However, there is an opportunity to eat to your hearts content if you desire to. The staff was very helpful and friendly. There is a fee to use the wi-fi, fitness center, and to participate in a few social activities at the resort. Parking was $17/day if you park yourself or $22/day for valet!!! This seemed exorbitant since it already feels like you are paying quite a bit to stay at the hotel. Pool towels are available at kiosks near the pools or lagoon and they will ask your room number and name and give you a wrist band to wear in order to use the pools or lagoon. The lagoon is a great place to snorkel for beginners or children. There were several sea turtles, eels, and colorful fish to see while in the lagoon. You can rent paddle boards, kayaks, and flotation devices at a stand at the lagoon. Prices are high for everything. There isn't a beach on the Hilton property so the lagoon is the closest you will get to a beach. An adults only pool is also available. A side note if you like to paddle board or kayak. There is a stand in front of the Marriott next door that runs specials on Monday, Wednesday, or Sunday for $25 per person from 10am-2pm, and you can trade off with all of their toys throughout that time. Great option during the off season, and a bit crowded during the busy season. The beach there is also excellent for ocean/bay swimming, and snorkeling is ok with a few small reef areas depending on the time of year and how windy it is. We did not try the Luau at the Hilton, though it is just one more option. The Hilton really is an excellent hotel if you want a clean, family friendly, and entertaining vacation. I would recommend this hotel to families, couples, or groups. ", " Ny self and husband stayed here in january 2012 but have only just got round to reviewing , we up graded to a see view room, well worth it , would sit on our small potio with a coffee in the morning and watch the humpback whales out at sea. The complex is very large and has lots of options for eating although some of the restuarants seem a little over price. Customer service was excellent and if you realy want to pamper yourself have a massage on the sea front. Watching the dolphins playing was a great way to pass the time when having lunch.We went on a whale watching trip which was definately worth the money to get so close to these magnificant creatures.We hired a car and visited thevolcano national park, views were awesome, if you stay around until sunset you can see the glow of the laver as the stars come out.Lovely people, beautiful place would love to go back. ", " Better than ever!! This was our second stay at the Resort and again it was wonderful . The Magic begins on arrival , the staff really make us feel the spirit of Aloha .The resort is huge , We got a room in the Ocean Tower, a fifteen minute walk from reception up there , but even for those who do not like to walk , it is not a problem, there are a monorail and a boat from reception to the rooms. The room is large, clean and very beautiful . (Hint : do not put food out of the room , there are many birds and it will cause a mess) . There are several pools and a beach with a giant lake bathed by the waters of the Pacific. There are a lot of pools: The Adult Pool, close to Ocean Tower; the Koala Pool with some slides and our favorite; the Kona pool which is huge with plenty of space to sunbathe and swim . If you prefer salt water, look for the Lagoon Beach for sea bathing or some water sport .In the lake , observe the turtles that always come to rest there. The food options are endless , great restaurants : Italian , Japanese, Chinese, Steakhouse ,salad bar, ice cream shop, sandwich shop; food for all tastes and pockets. For those who like parrots and macaws, the Resort has many of the various species that are shown during the day. If you like GOLF, the Golf Couse is fantastic. In summary : Coming to the Big Island? Don't even think about staying in other place then the Hilton Waikoloa Village. ", " This hotel was beautiful. You had to force yourself to leave and go sightseeing --drinks were a bit expensive and some restaurants were also but it had great atmosphere. Our hotel room overlooked the dolphin pool and we also had a great view of the ocean. Would definitely stay here again. ", " My just stayed here for a dear friend's wedding and the place was gorgeous, quiet, well maintained, polite staff, great food in all the restaurants and very clean. The high cost is due to exceptional service and quality stay. The wedding set up was exceptional and very private. I have not enough to say. Go, stay, pay and RELAX! ", " I was skeptical from all the reviews but we had already signed up to go. First this resort is beautiful and immaculate. The grounds are well taken care of and beautiful. Yes the resort is large. Remember the word here is resort, which means larger, and more expensive with lots of amenities. They have nice resort stores if you need anything. The best place location wise, is the lagoon tower.The birds are loud in the evening and am for a short period of time . I didn't mind them. This might disturb some people depends if you are a light sleeper etc. We slept with the doors open to hear the ocean.The lagoon towers has Ocean views and the dolphin lagoon views, close to main entrance.The rooms are nicely done and the daily service is great. If you need anything they will bring it to you immediately. Robes aren't in the rooms, but you can ask them to bring you one. You will walk a lot at this resort. They make it user friendly as much as possible. If you have walking issues this might not be the best place for you. If you have a car, do the valet. yes its 5 dollars more but its minimal at that point. They bring up the cars quickly and you won't have to walk with all your things. You will appreciate this in the end. The lot is large and dragging your things will become tiresome by the end of the time you are there. We went in September so it wasnt crowded and full of kids as some of the reviews had mentioned. The food is okay and yes expensive, as with any resort you go to. My suggestion is to go to the queens marketplace and off site to eat. The food by the lagoon grill isnt bad. Not a large selection but a regular burger is okay priced and good quality. The views on the resort are stunning. Staff is friendly.This is a great spot for younger kids.The lagoon is nice for snorkeling, it is open to the ocean so you will get natural wild life in the lagoon. I have older teenagers. We rented a car so we could go places. Which depending on what type of person you are this is great. If you dont want to leave the hotel you will have a great time, but not see any of the island. We went into Kona to eat and see the local spots. My son decided to take up surfing so we went to Kona boys , who were great and got a board and lessons . We went to the local beach spots and had a great time. We spent more time off site than at the resort .. We did the ATV rentals. It was fun anyone can go. Saw parts of the island you wouldn't normally see. A great beach is about 15 minutes away south toward Kona. Directly across from the cemetery entrance. This beach has the most beautiful crystal clear water I have ever seen. We live in florida so we have nice beaches. Remember this is a volcanic island so the sand varies from place to place. We also went to two step to snorkel. We brought our own equipment. You can rent or purchase almost anywhere. This is a great spot to snorkel . We also went to pine trees to surf, this road is now paved so you can get there with any car. Also a nice beach to hang out . If you want a lei greeting don't pay for it. Just buy yourself a beautiful lei at the airport it will cost you under 10.00 for a beautiful one. The lei greetings are overpriced and not worth it. We had a great time and would go back to visit Hawaii again. Also used the spa, it was very nice. Again resort prices for the services but had a wonderful massage and the facilities were very nice . The hot tub is designed with lava like rocks, very cool design. I would do this even if you arent getting any services if you like a private hot tub area to relax. ", " This was the second time we've stayed here and it was even better than 13 years ago! Staff was friendly...Hilton Honors members receive meaningful discounts...and the restaurants and attractions were wonderful. Great place to go with or without kids. Lots to do and see or just to relax. ", " I found it to be quiet, clean and a great place to start your holiday. Lots to do or little to do it is up to you. I have two boys aged 12 and 14 and they had lots of fun. With two shopping centres within the village you really dont have to go far. I would go back again no problems ", " The Hilton Waikoloa and their staff did an excellent job meeting every need of our 300+ participants. Check-in, to accommodations, to meeting facilities, meals and refreshments were all prepared and ready for our use and the staff was extremely helpful and efficient. Looking forward to a future conference with another organization in May 2014! One thing...Need more easily accessible outlets near headboard for those with medical needs (e.g. CPAP Machines). ", " My daughter had a wonderful wedding at the Hilton. The wedding planner Robin was wonderful everything was wonderful . Everything went perfectly and smoothly . It was a wonderful way to have a simple elegant wedding .Robin took care of the flowers cake Minister and the set up. She also help line up a wonderful photographer I felt like this was the easiest and best way to have a wedding . there was minimal stress and anxiety . Thank you Robin. ", " This was the trip of a lifetime and the Big Island did not disappoint. From the minute we arrived at the airport we were made aware that this island was very relaxed and the locals would go to any length to make your visit special. the drive from the airport was easy and the incredible scenery made for a very excitable car.The hotel itself was everything we could have hoped for, a word of warning check in can be slow but go with it, the process is fully worth it.The hotel itself is vast but importantly the staff make you feel like you are the only one there. Our room had recently been refurbished and was stunning and fitted the family in with no problems.Tips: Early morning coffee is a must at one of the many coffee houses, quiet and peaceful - a perfect start.If you have a car get yourself down to the supermarket and pick up some basics, the hotel can be pricey but this is a perfect way of balancing the cash.A trip out in the car and across to the other coast is well worth the drive and gives you a different perspective on the climate and scenery.We paid for the children to do the dolphin experience and it was money well spent, yes expensive but what an experience.A fantastic hotel. ", " Spent 9 days at this resort for a conference. Fantastic experience all around Take the time to attend the Luau -- beautifully done telling local folklore with song, dance & narration. Exquisite food and service throughout the resort! For meeting planners the team you work with are very professional and work very hard to make your group's experience what you want it to be and then some! Whether walking the museum hallways, riding the tram or boat -- you always see something new and interesting! Weather was spectacular in August! Plenty of shopping and eating options on the resort or a short trolly ride away. Rooms are very nice and entire resort was very clean and orderly....beautiful grounds and the views were awesome!! ", " We just took 30 people to the Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort in Kona and were received by the sales and senior events Mgrs, Alanna and Agnes. They greeted each of us, got us through a quick check in and accompanied all our guests to their rooms! Our rooms were wonderful with all the comforts of home and a lovely view of the resort. We enjoyed all facilities the hotel has to offer and in 4 days couldn't use them all! There are so many pools to choose from, water slides, hot tubs and an ocean water swim area to snorkel with the turtles and fish! The food was amazing in all outlets from the magnificent breakfast buffet, to the very exclusive restaurant......and the Luau Dinner and Show was over the top...so fun!! The food, again, was outstanding, and the Hawaiian dancers and MC so entertaining. We had a blast at this hotel and would recommend it to individual travelers for groups of any size! We are in the same Industry and we were impressed with the hospitality everyone from the Hilton Waikiki provides all guests. Kudos to Debi Bishop GM for having such a wonderful, energetic and happy staff! It shows! ", " My girlfriend and I stayed for three nights first week of Sept 2013. It is an absolutely fantastic resort. The unfortunate thing for us was that was our visit to the Island so we spent our days sightseeing and did not experience the resort. If you want a vacation where you have choices but never have to travel this is the place. Restaurants were very good, loved the pools, staff were great. A special thanks to Theresa Cosgrove for taking the time to show us the property. I will definitly go back but will stay on property and enjoy the experience. I find Hawaii expensive where ever you go so might as well enjoy to the max. ", " I love the Hilton Waikoloa because it is such a departure from the norm. I have heard that the grounds were planed by Disney engineers, making it a beautiful and exotic departure into the beauty of Hawaii. I was shocked to see that people complained about the walk or ride back to the lobby, if you are vacation you are supposed to slow down and be present in the moment. I have been coming to the Hilton Waikoloa since 2001 and I never get tired of the beauty, the museum quality art, the dolphin pools and the views at sunset. The food is pricy but also well worth it. If budget is an issue, be sure to plan eating diner elsewhere, otherwise, relax and enjoy a once in a lifetime destination. Come relax, splash, swing in a hammock and leave the stress of the world behind! PS. This is a great honeymoon spot as well as for families. ", " We stayed here for 4 nights using Hilton Honors points. Let me start by saying that this resort is huge, almost ridiculously so. We knew in advance that the Lagoon Tower had been recently renovated and was closer to the main lobby. So we used a few more points to stay there and we were very happy we did. The other towers are FAR from the main lobby/entrance. There is a shuttle to get over there, however some friends of ours stayed there recently and said it was faster to walk than to use the shuttle. We also wanted to stay in the lagoon tower so we were closer to our car. When we checked in they said we had to use the main entrance however later discovered that to could access the tennis area using our key card, which was MUCH closer to our room. We were upgraded to an ocean view room due to our Hilton Honors membership status. Our room was very large and had a beautiful view of the ocean. The amenities at the hotel were also very nice. I did yoga on the beach one morning while my husband used the gym and spa. Please note, this hotel does not have a beach on the ocean (it does have a beach on the lagoon). So I walked to the beach (about 15 mins) for yoga. Not a bad walk if you are fit but could take some time if you are not. The people at the activities desk were also very friendly and helpful. They arranged for us to attend the luau at the Hilton. The luau was a bit cheesy, but I think that's just the nature of them. I was imagining that it would be on the coast with some sunset views, unfortunately it was not. However, the food, drinks and service were all very good at the luau. We also had brunch at the hotel one morning. The food was very good but a bit overpriced. Overall, the hotel and grounds were immaculately kept and staff were all very friendly. I would definitely stay here again. ", " This is my second stay at the Hilton Waikoloa and once again had a great stay. The setting is beautiful, the pools are great and the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. This is a great place for families or couples to visit and enjoy the Big Island. There are only 2 items I would ask the hotel to improve on: 1) Make visitors more aware of the no smoking policy. We had to deal with lots of cigar and cigarette smoke drifting up onto our lanai and room when screen door was open and 2) Improve quality of food in pizza restaurant. Outside of these 2 items, we had a fantastic stay for 8 nights! ", " I stayed here for 4 nights and really wanted to write a review about how great it was for kids! We read somewhere to stay in the Lagoon wing and I am so happy we did! Our room was on the ground floor and we could walk right out to the kids pool. I really recommend doing the same. It made our stay so enjoyable! And the kids pool is excellent with lots of sand and shallow water but the whole pools area was super. We could hear the folks next door very clearly, which was a bit annoying because they did not have kids and stayed up late. I think they changed room though probably because they could hear us too! the food was the low point. Not very healthy. Not many family options. Boring, expensive, boring. There was a frig in the room so we went to the local health food store and stocked up. We did the swim with the dolphin experience and it was great and worth the splurge. My grandson was 2 1/2 and he loved it and got a toy dolphin in the gift shop and named it after the dolphin and it is still one of his favorite toys. The video is quite good too. My grandson would have been happy never to leave the resort. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is an exquisite hotel---a total experience! Love the boats that take guests to their rooms, the dolphin pool, the pier bar and coffee shop. It's an elegant hotel that offers everything a guest could want! Very romantic! ", " Such an awesome experience...I use the word 'experience' because this place is more than a hotel, or spa or resort. It has everything you could want in a upscale place - but it never looses its charm or...'aloha' spirit.Rooms were big & spacious - overlooking the waterfall ahead & beach/bay to the side was a nice treat. Pull out sofa for the kids made it easy. Sheets & bed were soooo comfy and the soaps were spa quality. Transportation around the property is in the form of boats & monorail - we often walked finding it the same time to wait for the transport & make all the stops. They make walking interesting, engaging & fun with the 'museum walk' - a fine collection of asian art & sculptures. So beautiful.Breakfast was A plus - never changed from day to day - but it didnt have to because of all the choices. Staff was always sweet & ready with a smile.Lagoon was a blast - turtles everywhere - it was rare you didn't see one. Cool eels and tons of yellow tangs - plus mullets jumping out of the water! The lagoon was closed due to a monk seal that happened onto the property & was hanging in the water fountain. They are extremely rare - so it was actually a very cool experience to see it. We appreciated the 'green' philosophy of the hotel - looking after the rare animal.Dolphin Quest is a blast & its literally RIGHT next to the breakfast place - so you can visit the dolphins daily - they're always out & about. Thanks for an awesome stay - we'll definitely be back! ", " We loved our stay at the village. We went to the nearby beach which there is a walk way from the hotel so you don't need the shuttle or car. We used the lagoon which is pretty neat and we were lucky enough to have the monk seal there as well since she's only 1 of 5 on the Big Island. Our room was clean and spacious to say the least, with a great lanai which we could see the sunset. We found a short cut to the parking lot so that did help and it was only a 5 minute walk to get to our room from the lobby. The food at the restaurants we tried were great. We didn't stay much at the resort and we did go down to the queens market to gourmet island and grab food and bring it back to the room. Overall a great experience and we will be staying here again. ", " Hilton Waikoloa is in a prime location on the big island where you're not too far from the airport, but also not too close to Kona. You feel quite secluded and that's a good thing. Getting around the island from the resort is easy enough, but if you want, you could easily spend your time without ever leaving. Swimming around in the lagoon with the sea turtles was my personal favorite. The food is pretty expensive, but there are shops within walking distance where you can grab cheaper food if you're looking to save a little. I recommend sitting through the timeshare presentation if you can. Doing so will get you discounts on excursions and enough Hilton bucks to have a nice dinner for free. ", " Overall the staff was very helpful. The trams and boats are fun to ride, but wait times are excessive. Food was excellent but servers were not. The Dolphin experience was a little expensive but my wife had a blast. Breakfast buffet was too expensive. ", " This is a wonderful place; it is the Disneyland of Hawaii (I Love Disneyland!), the grounds are Beautiful and well-kept. Magnificent--Better than Disneyland , for grown-ups, and lots for the kiddies too! It is a large resort (63 acres) with buildings packed with art and history. The food was very good, although about 25% more than the places we ate at in Kona. You are paying for the grounds, service, and upkeep--and you do get what you pay for. They do supply you with a small refrigerator, a shuttle bus to visit the village, (for groceries, cheaper food, and souvenirs) a boat or tram to haul luggage or shorten your walk; valet parking--and if you have a car, you can go into Kona also to explore--we did half a day out of the 4 nights we stayed. I have severe eating disorder , and they treated me very well ( just ask if you need any help navigating ). The people treated me very kindly. It is about 19 miles from the Kona airport, and a little further to Kona. But everything you need is in the Waikiloa Village. It may not be for everyone, but most people I met were having the time of their lives. It is very Beautiful; and the beaches around it are as well (and, well-kept secret--the snorkling right outside the protected man-made lagoon is exquisite and rivals Waikiki--but no lifeguards, so be careful of tides and swim/snorkel at your own risk. If your smart and practice safety guidelines, it is well worth it!) And the Tiki torch runner in the evenings is fun to watch--he blows his conch-shell horn every night and then runs the path bordering the ocean lighting Tiki torches as he runs--a half-mile or more , Non-stop, Hawaiian style. we hope they pay him well ; ). We especially enjoyed the unrivaled , gorgeously magical Sunsets--beyond words. And sunrises. and swimming & snorkling. We took Lots of photos--watermarkphotography (see website, we'll be revamping and loading it with photos in the coming months...)We stayed 10 nights total on the Big Island, beginning with a terrific B & B at Kaimu, + 2 nights on the Hilo side (the Rainforest), visiting the Kiluea Crater and Rainbow Falls, a night at U. Of Nations in Kona, and ending with my radio prize win, 4 nights at the Hilton ( plus RT airfare fore 2). We enjoyed it all...the Hilton was the icing on the cake and cherry on top---thanks to everyone who helped make our stay so pleasurable. We plan to return with family in near future. God bless you all! ", " We have been there regularly for the past 15 years. We're now going annually. We have seen the ups and downs and for the past 6 years the Waikoloa Village has been on an up swing. The overhaul to the Lagoon Tower did wonders and now its started on the Ocean tower. Palace needs to be next but it's still in very good shape. Specially the suites. They're our favorite. We stay in the ocean front suite either on the 5th or 6th floor. Great LARGE outdoor lanai to kick back and watch the ocean and sunsets. And dont forget the tropical drinks as the sun sets!

Pool/running water systems are diverse playgrounds for swimming, sauna or even snorkeling as the lagoon is connected to the ocean; thus inviting in several species of marine life. Food is wonderful and rooms just ok/beds are comfortable/balconies offer spectacular views. Great native performances daily/nightly. Daily breakfast is varied and tasty. ", " Love the ocean view rooms, the cleanliness of everything, and the train/boat experience. Great place to watch the sunset with friends and family and to see The Big Island. The bad part of the hotel is the wait times for the train or boat. If one chooses not to take these methods of transportation the walk to a room could take around 10 minutes because the resort is huge. ", " We are a couple with no kids, so we intentionally picked a quieter time (i.e. not school holiday). We stayed end of August through early September for a week. The resort was pretty quiet overall except for Labor Day weekend. Some locals told us that the resort has good rates for the locals during off season (which apparently it is right now) and also day passes so quite a number of families would come and use the pool/lagoon/water slides, etc. With that in mind, it still didn't feel too crowded during Labor Day weekend.As mentioned by many reviewers before, this resort is huge. It takes at least 15 minutes to go from the lobby to the room (we had a room towards the east side of Ocean Tower). There is a train which runs every 15-20 minutes it seems and a boat in the afternoon. We mostly walked because the resort is just so beautiful and enjoyable to walk around in. We saw turtles sunbathing along the coast and could get pretty close to take pictures. In the lagoon we swam with turtles every day. Depending on the visibility, the snorkeling can be quite good. But the lagoon was a relatively safe place for kids to try a number of water activities as the water was very calm and pretty shallow, especially during low tide. As the water was so calm it was also a great place to try out stand up paddle boarding. Be aware that they had two kinds of boards at the resort. If you came late, you would get the inflatable kind which was wobbly and difficult to balance on. Our room was on the 7th floor in the Ocean Tower with an ocean view. We could hear the train but it wasn't really that big of a deal. The bird noises though were a different story - the birds hid in the trees in the central courtyard, and were very loud at dusk and dawn. I am not complaining at all as it was just nature, but something to be aware of for light sleepers. The room was quite big and comfortable. There was a fridge in the room but no microwave. There was also a coffee machine in the room but the coffee was pretty flavorless compared to what they sold at the coffee shop downstairs. The bed was comfortable. Water pressure was good and temperature control worked well.The restaurants were quite expensive. We ate around the island for the most part, or got stuff from the ABC store in Queen's shopping center (5 minute drive in Waikoloa) - they had fresh fruit, sandwiches, poke by the pound, bento boxes, sushi and musubi - all good for a quick meal. We ate at KPC - good view. Food was good but for that price I expected spectacular food which it was not. The pizza place was surprisingly good. The pizza was probably one of the best I have ever had but it was quite pricy - 2 beers, an appetizer, a personal size pizza and 1 pasta came to about 100 bucks including tip. We also had salads at the Boat Landing Cantina (the slogan: \"where aloha meets hola\") which were very good. Breakfast - definitely expensive for a good buffet. $30 per person but they had a deal where if arrived before 7am, you get 10 dollars off - I am not sure if the deal is still available. There was both American style and Asian style food.I also used the spa and got a lomi lomi massage. I think my therapist's name was Maurine but I can't be sure. It was heavenly. I stayed to use the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi (hotel guests pay $20 per day to use this unless you book a service) which was quite relaxing. I don't think it was worth $20 though since there was so much outside of the spa that was quite relaxing as well.Overall I think this resort is great for couples when off season, and good for family reunions as there was stuff to do for all ages (and safe for kids). ", " Aloha!! Our stay was September 3-10.We are Hilton Diamond members. I can't recommend this resort enough! We brought our 3 year old son and 14 month old daughter..this place is perfect for families! We stayed in the Lagoon tower on the 6 th floor overlooking the dolphins, lagoon and ocean..the views are amazing, the dolphins are so well taken care of and are so much fun to watch! The lagoon is wonderful and so is the big pool..part with a sandy bottom for the little ones! Many complainers mentioned all the walking, but we loved it..the grounds are immaculate and the art collection very interesting as you stroll around..beautiful fragrant flowering trees..grab a plumeria blossom from the ground, put it in your hair and enjoy the walk! Restaurants are more expensive than at home, but not outrageous, unless you live off the dollar menu at home.Breakfast buffet was great!Food is good..atmosphere perfect! Service is wonderful.. everyone we encountered greeted us with a smile and went out of their way to help..tip your maid a few bucks and she will leave you flowers on your pillow and take special care of you! Rooms in our tower were clean, and very well appointed. If you have littles bring a stroller bc little legs can get worn out fast! Mahalo to Hilton Waikoloa Village for a great Hawaiian vacation! ", " This is a great resort if you have kids that love the water. The pools and lagoon are wonderful. My kids (8/10) had never snorkeled before and they fell in love with it. They were in awe over the sea turtles, eels and fish. The lagoon was a great way to introduce snorkeling since you don't have to worry about currents, waves or rocks. Tanya, the Lagoon Manager, taught our kids to snorkel in the pool first and then took them on boogie boards in the lagoon. (This was a free service that the hotel offers.) She was amazing and made the experience really fun. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and really enjoyed relaxing on the lanai while watching the dolphins. While food is expensive, they make up for it with other little extras - like free movies and video games to check out. This is a resort that the whole family will enjoy. ", " Even if you don't stay in this hotel, take some time and go visit it and allow several hours for your walk on the grounds and the hotel itself. You don't have to park and pay. On the south side of the hotel past the parking lot you can park along the road and walk across the parking lot. The entry is awesome and walking across the bridge you can walk under a waterfall and see the porpoise in the lagoon, the restaurant is on the edge and you can sit, eat and watch. Continue your walk to Budha Point and the view is unreal. ", " We went on our honeymoon here and could not have asked for a better place to stay. The sunsets are gorgeous and having the lagoon to swim in is a lot of fun. We swam with sea turtles every day in the lagoon. It is a rather big resort, but that just means more space to explore. The tram runs around the resort but it is usually quicker to just walk. Everything is expensive but that is expected in Hawaii at the tourist spots. We will definitely be going back some day. ", " Stayed there 8 nights, had a great time snorkeling in their lagoon. the sun rises were amazing, and since our room was had a curved balcony we had view of sun set also amazing. ask for a room with ocean view it was worth it. great pics/ memories!!!! we will be back! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is an ideal destination for couples and families. There's plenty to do, to keep everyone busy and entertained. From the fine art and antiques that line the halls on the grounds, to the water park, beaches, and swimming pools. The water taxi is an ideal way to get to the guest rooms, with lots of wild fish swimming around the boat. There is a fantastic water park for the kids, with a towering water slide, water falls, waves, boats and other fun things to do, enclosed sand beaches for lounging in the sun, and, of course, pool-side service! There are a number of excellent restaurants on the grounds, and the Kings Village is a short shuttle ride away, with even more dining and excellent shopping. I highly recommend this hotel! ", " Everything you can imagine and more in one resort. Dolphins, boatrides, water slides, sea turtles, snorkeling - all in one location. Bathrooms have soaking tubs and shower for two -perfect for a romantic get-away. ", " Though my stay at the Hilton was mandated by the federal government (business travel), it would have been my choice nonetheless. Looking forward to my next visit in December. Other future plans includes bringing family members for a leisure stay at the Hilton so that I can fully enjoy all of the amenities available to guests. ", " While we weren't looking forward to a \"resort\" for 7 days we did want to get away and relax in Hawaii.We have stayed on this island several times so we weren't going to be doing any sightseeing this trip. This resort ( hotel) was wonderful! The property is large & lovely...gardens, ponds,views of the ocean. The best part is their own lagoon where you can sit under a palapa until you are ready to swim and snorkle and then you discover all of the beautiful fish and sea turtles. Staying at a hotel is expensive because you have no kitchen but each room has a small refrig. Just down the road outside of the hotel is a very nice grocery store where we bought snacks,fruit, breakfast items and ate dinner out on the property ( several restaurants to choose from). Beautiful Asian antique replicas adorn every breezeway and hallway. Lovely little church for services as well as weddings overlooking ocean.Spacious rooms. I cried when we left...I could have stayed another two weeks..... ", " Stayed in the ocean tower and had an amazing view. The property is beautiful. There are many good restaurants to choose from. The pools are really nice. Loved a natural lagoon pool that has the ocean water recycled every 2 hours. Not sure where everyone goes after dark, but you see no one. 2 shopping areas that are close and nice...range of shops from Louis Vuitton to souviners. Not far from Kona airport. Great for families. ", " From the time we arrived at the hotel, we loved every minute. We got in late so we couldn't see the view that awaited us the next morning! Breathtaking, crisp blue water and beautiful well maintained grounds. We stayed in the lagoon tower and on the first floor. Our room opened up so u could just walk out onto the grass! The KPC restaurant was great. We ate there 2 nights. They light the tiki torches about 530 pm and everyone sits and watches the sunset! Gorgeous! The breakfast buffet was also good but expensive! We loved every part of this vacation and will go back! ", " Nothing wrong that is. Best place to stay when visiting the Big Island. It is a tropical fantasy built in the 1980's made out of a bare lava field. You still drive through a lava field coming the short way from the airport but once you get to the resort, it is every bit the tropical paradise you want from a trip to Hawaii. The shops, restaurants, golf, tennis and snorkeling are great not to mention the wonderful pool and rooms are all first rate.We used to have a coffee farm in South Kona and when we wanted a weekend get away we would go here. Kama'aina style. ", " This hotel was a stark contrast to the Hilton on Waikiki beach. From the moment you walk in you are just in heaven. Everything is so beautiful and the staff is so eager to help. The rooms are immaculate and spacious. The restaurants are delicious and there is every type of food imaginable. The lagoon is so relaxing and the snorkeling is amazing. We traveled with 6 children ranging from 10 to 17 years old and every one of them enjoyed the lagoon. We used the kayaks, paddle boards, paddle boats and more. We snorkeled and saw the most amazing fish and huge turtles and we didn't even have to leave the hotel! When we were there a Monk Seal happened to come into the lagoon and they had to close it for a few days. Although that was disappointing the kids still had a great time in the many pools and enjoyed going on the pool slides. They all swam with the dolphins and enjoyed watching them every day. There are so many places we want to travel to we try to not go back to the same place twice. For this hotel I am hoping to break that policy. My only complaint would be that the restaurants are VERY expensive but if you want to visit Hawaii it is just something you have to expect. I highly recommend this hotel for both couples traveling alone (there are adult only areas) and families. ", " Wow!! This place was beautiful and 62 acres of pristine land. All was as expected for a Hilton establishment!! Got a great rate thru \"friends & family\". There is so much to see & do there. Staff was awesome!! Bartenders at the pool bar were like family!! Rooms were so nice & huge. Loved our view from our room. Partial ocean view was great. But expensive parking rates. But do suggest valet for the few extra bucks. It was quick to receive your car & staff very funny & friendly. Would go back here for sure. ", " Had the pleasure to stay at this hotel with my family a couple years ago and it was the best hotel on the Big Island! Tons of activities, friendly service that isn't stuffy, and a very relaxing enviroment. Can't wait to go back in October of this year! ", " Rooms were fabulous and the views unbelievable A little bit pricey but still well worth it. The service was also some of the best ever. The resort has many activities and the host were very helpful in making our daily plan. We didn't want to leave and almost extended our stay for another week ", " I did not stay here, I visited the dolphin experience. This had been on my \"bucket list\" for some time now. My husband suprised me with the dolphin experience. If u can afford it by all means do it. You will no regret anything. Most of all have fun. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and it was great! The rooms were beautiful, clean and the view was awesome. We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and can't wait to go back. The tram and the boats get you around the property easily and walking the property is scenic. We loved whale watching from Buddha Point. It was an all around perfect vacation. It would be great for families as well - lots to do and see. ", " This was an awesome resort to stay at. We loved our whole stay. The grounds are beautiful! Our room was clean and quiet (Palace Tower). There is a great variety of restaurant choices. We loved the Luau. Upgrading to the premium seating was worth every penny! The Chinese and Pizza restaurants were great! The breakfast buffet was very good (a little expensive, but worth it). The tram runs pretty consistently, but when we missed it, the walk was just fine. The lagoon was nice and the pools were fun for the kids. Wish we had more time there to enjoy it more! ", " This is provably the best Hilton property we have ever stayed in. I'm a diamond Hilton Honor's member so I visited many Hilton hotels over the last 25 years as a traveling salesman and this is the best Hilton property. Hilton has many brands and some are more luxurious (Waldorf Astoria Park City, UT for example) but under the Hilton brand this property takes the price in my book. It is a large place, so much so that a tram and a series of boats are necessary to get to your room or to the different pools and restaurants within the property, depending on where you are but it is worth the trip. If you choose to walk you get to do it in an art museum as the walkways are decorated with many pieces of art. The pools and the view are priceless and the people makes the location ideal for any activity or for no activity at all. The Big Island if the setting for this property and that makes it even better. I highly recommend it. ", " This hotel is so amazing I really don't know where to start! It is really a hotel complex with several separate large buildings. More of a resort than a hotel. All of buildings were gorgeous. They are connected by a walkway filled with fantastic art as well as a canal in case you prefer to travel by boat. This is the second time we visited, but this time we brought our daughter and her friends and they had a great time. The series of beaches and giant lagoon is fantastic and there is no lack of interesting activities including snorkeling, paddle boarding, swimming with dolphins, etc. This is undoubtedly the best Hilton Hotel that we have ever stayed at. We stayed in a suite that was simply spectacular. It even had a grand piano in the living room over looking the ocean. Pricey? Yes. Worth it, definitely. My only issue was with the food. KPC was a good restaurant but the others were only ok. Also, the resort is huge and there are a lot of people. If you want a private quiet experience this may not be the best place. However, we were there as a family and also traveling with several other groups of friends and this was perfect. ", " This property is amazing. It is so large it has a tram and boat service to get around. We did the dolphin encounter with our 3 year old and it was awesome. Food was great with alot of options and variety. Drinks were way expensive, but that was expected. The lagoon was great for snorkeling had an amazing variety of fish and activities. ", " We stayed here with two teens for 10 days in July 2013. Yes, this place could be described as Disney-like because the grounds are impeccably maintained and there is a tram and boat that move people through the resort but we found the resort very satisfying. The pools were fun, pool chairs plentiful, and views gorgeous! The \"beach\" is just a strip near the man made lagoon and our family visited it once on our trip. With so many other gorgeous beaches in the area we didn't think the snorkeling or swimming in the lagoon was too exciting. We had adjoining rooms in the ocean tower with views of the ocean. The birds were loud in the courtyard outside our room door but we didn't find that they ruined our sleep. We ended up staying on for 3 days because of Tropical Storm Flossie and were moved to a garden room in the palace tower. It was acceptable but more typical \"hotel-like\" than the Ocean Tower. We found all staff to be friendly and accommodating and had no difficulty with check in or with extending our stay. There is a resort fee per room that covers wireless, free movie rentals, and Hawaiian culture classes. We had a lot of fun making leis and learning to play ukuleles! We are walkers and art lovers so we really enjoyed our daily treks throughout the resort...the art collection is terrific. The parking lot is a bit of a hike and not cheap but I can't imagine not having a car to visit other spots on the island. We saved money by bringing back food to the rooms which had mini-fridges. The restaurants and other amenities were about what you would expect to pay at a resort. We had good experiences at all the restaurants we ate at. Some might want a more \"authentic\" Hawaiian experience but if you want to be surrounded by beauty, albeit man-made, then this is a good choice. ", " Would have to have been one of the nicest resorts that we have stayed at. Every thing was there, good food, lots to do, lay by the pool, snorkel in the lagoon, swim with dolphins, walk on the beach, play mini golf, watch the sunset, paddle board and watch the waves go by. ", " Stayed here for nine days with my family and had an amazing time! The property is gorgeous! There is great shopping nearby (The Kings and Queens Shops), as well as great restaurants (Sansei)!! While staying at the property I was married there, went on the sunset sail, went to the spa (which is excellent!)several times, and to the luau. I can't say enough great things about our experience here! ", " Overall the Hilton was a great place to stay with the family. The hotel is big so even if it was crowded everyone was spread out. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. I would go back. We only had a couple of problems where the internet cable was broken when we arrived and they replaced it right away. The second was the air conditioning wasn't work properly and they came twice but still wasn't working correctly. ", " We stayed here in June 2013 with our 2 young children. The resort is lovely and sprawling with gardens and lots of things to see. There is a huge pool area with waterslides and another lagoon pool which delightfully was full of fish and turtles!The room we had was a lagoon cabana room located on the ground floor which suited us well as we could walk out across the grass to the pool. The room also had a lovely outlook over the Dolphin pool which our children loved. The room itself was spacious and the bathrooms large, clean and modern.The resort is so large there is a monorail to take you around and this turned out to be an attraction in itself for our youngest who loved to take a ride on the \u2018train\u2019. We tried some of the restaurants and found all to be excellent and yes, a little pricey but not too bad. Our children both did the Dolphin Quest swim at the resort.Note there is no beach at this property (it\u2019s all volcanic rock) but the resort has its own man made lagoon beach with great snorkelling!. ", " First of all, disregard all the reviews from people who complain about the wait times for the tram or boat that take you around the 62 acre resort. These people are obviously NOT on vacation or if they are, need to learn to chill out and relax. I think we \"waited\" for the tram twice in the 7 days we were there. Also disregard the people who complain about how expensive everything is. Hawaii is expensive folks and yet worth every penny. If you're looking for cheap, go to Mexico. You can save a little money by stopping at Costco/ Walmart/ Safeway to pick up snacks, beverages, water & wine (or sunscreen etc if you forgot it) for the room in Kona before heading north to the resort. There's a mini fridge in the room (2x2x2) but no microwave so keep that in mind. The two pool areas were always impeccably clean and attended to and not overly crowded which is important to me. This place is truly a gem. I saw tropical fish I've only seen in aquariums freely swimming in the onsite water features and birds I've only seen in cages and zoos freely walking and flying about. Ditto on the dolphins.As for dining, I cannot recommend Roy's at the Kings Shops on Waikoloa Beach Dr enough. Best food & service I've had in years. The food at Merriman's was delicious too.I would definitely recommend Waikoloa and this hotel. ", " This is a village in itself. Take time to explore the hotel when there. The pools, lagoon, and especially the art are things to spend time on. It's a museum and theme park rolled into one. Wish the Dolphin experience and some of the services were more value priced, but you can't beat the overall stay ", " Had awesome experience staying at this hotel. An A1 hotel, would come back again if given a choice. The location of the hotel, the quality of the rooms, the service of the helpful staff and facilities inside the resort were just awesome. And the overall ambience inside the resort was as though we are in a miniatured version of paradise. Frankly speaking after a long while had a real experience of relaxing vacation. Much of that I would attribute to our stay at Hilton, Waikoloa Village, HI. ", " This is a serious world class resort (just leaving tomorrow 23/8/2013) with 62 acres full of superb facilities including an on-site tram, boat, tennis courts, dolphins, SPA, boating, snorkeling with turtles etc. Expensive, but you pay for the service and facilities. The hotel cost us around \u00a3190-200/night for a room with 2 adults +2 (teen kids).We stayed in the Lagoon area (near Dolphins) which have superb rooms and really close to all the amenities. The rooms are spacious and very clean with PS3 for the kids and full WIFI (free). We loved this resort. The prices are high, but we had a car so drove out most days. The parking is $17/day, but for $22/day you get valet service. You can also buy a voucher for $29.95 which gives 10% of drinks and food. We purchased this on the 1st of our 8-day stay. We did not dine in the hotel (apart from food at the pool bar), but the evening bar etc was very good with live music daily. There is loads of pools which are very safe !There is local shopping Queens and Kings market place with some designer shops. I would recommend going to Kona for food etc. We found a great new Indian curry place which was excellent !!!!! ", " I've stayed here before several times. It is a wonderful resort to take the family to with plenty to keep the kids of all ages occupied. There are several swimming pools to chose from, then there is the lagoon to go snorkeling in. The lagoon is a bit cloudy and snorkeling visibility is sort of low, but if you are an accomplished snorkeler you can go under the bridge and out into the bay for a bit more reef fish. The restaurants on the property are pretty good, but be prepared they are rather expensive. If you wish to go off site there are some good restaurants at the Kings and Queens markets just up the road. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, the views are better from the upper floors, maybe 3rd or 4th and up. Our room had mainly a mountain view, but you could see the coast line and the swimming pools as well. We've stayed in both the Lagoon Tower and the Ocean Tower. The views are better from the Lagoon Tower, but access to the water slide pool is better from the Ocean tower. The wifi connection was very good in the Lagoon tower, but not as good in the Ocean tower. The on site Japanese restaurant is very good. The food quality was excellent, and there was a lot of variety. The Chinese restaurant is also quite good, and had something for everyone in the family to have. DEFINITELY make reservations though the restaurants fill up pretty quickly in the evening. If you have smaller children, go earlier maybe around 5 to 530 PM, there are fewer people. I've had several stays where I couldn't get into the restaurant that I wanted because I didn't book a reservation early, particularly the Japanese restaurant. Generally, you will find a place to eat at one of the restaurants, just might not be when and what you were looking for that evening. Getting around the site is pretty easy. You could walk from one end to the other in maybe 20 minutes. The main ways to cross the site are to take the tram, or the boats. The tram is faster, and therefor has more round trips. The boat is nice, though rather slow and times between boats are quite long. There are a few video displays along the tram line to help you decide which to take. ", " location location location the hotel was a heavenly experience everyone was helpful and courteous from valet to valet check out to checkout the food was excellent and the shopping at the queens and kings shops were awesome i highly reccomend this hotel and giving it a 5 star ", " The best Hotel on the Big Island, we will go again & get some shopping in @ the same time. The Dolphins were so agile watching them perform. Having the ability to travel by boat or trans am was great. ", " This is a great resort - great pools, very nice breakfast buffet, good restaurants, and fantastic rooms. The Kids Club is very well run and provides a great opportunity for parents to have a date. We will definitely go back. ", " This was our family's fourth visit to this Hilton property, and we fully enjoyed our stay. The room was beautiful and fresh, and offered a great view of the ocean. Staff was friendly and helpful and all of our interactions were easy and satisfying. The location is stunning-- so be sure to take time to enjoy the views of the ocean (it's easy to get absorbed in the hotels lagoon and pool areas, and forget you are in a spectacular natural setting too!). We find this is a resort that's ideal for one or two night stays-- to soak up all the man-made fun-- and then we head to a rental house to settle into Hawaii. ", " We came to this resort because we saw it on Wheel of Fortune! lol! Well, I can't say enough good things about it. It is not cheap, but it is as beautiful as the pictures show (maybe even more so), the staff is friendly and eager to please. We had a great time swimming through waterfalls in the pool(s), snorkeling in the Lagoon with the sea turtles, and watching the dolphins play (it is an extra cost, but we also swam with them ~ incredible experience!). Beautiful views of the sunrise and sunset. Ride the tram, cruise the channel onboard the boat or walk the beautiful grounds. ", " This is our first time to big island, and stay in this hotel with friends recommendation. It is so huge that you should take train or boat to your room. My child enjoy the dolphin games so much as well as the differents pools. For me, I loved the beach view with different color in times of the day. ", " That's fine with me,, don't come back,, just more awesome space for others to enjoy.. Beautiful grounds, glorious views,,Pools and pools,, delicious food. Coconut cream Br\u00fbl\u00e9e at Provision was a work of art. Already set to come back In 2014. ", " I can not imagine a better resort for the whole family, especially the kids. Like us, many three generational families there. Great pools, wonderful snorkeling, tide pools, protected lagoon and more. Helpful friendly service staff. A variety of restaurants (Pizza, Chinese, Japanese, American fine dining, and the great lagoon grill for lunch). Special kudos to Hailey on the cabana staff and Susan on the security staff. Rooms large and comfortable, housekeeping staff efficient and fast. Do avoid the Luau. Food cafeteria quality and with 500 people, all sitting at ground level, not enjoyable and extremely expensive. Kids only had choice of chicken fingers or Mac & Cheese for $$$$ dollars. Do seriously consider Dolphin Quest. A bucket list experience. ", " The hotel is so big and has excellent condition. I like its train and boat and very nice scenery around the hotel. The big breakfast served by the hotel is very good. The breakfast will be $10 off before 7:00am. The hotel's free shuttles to Quees Shop and Kings Shop are very convenient for people to make shopping. ", " Love staying at this hotel for all of the amenities, location and overall value. Be prepared to bring some ear plugs if the birds get too loud :) You really can't beat swimming with the turtles in the lagoon. ", " I was concerned about this booking after reading some of the other reviews on this website. However I was pleased when I arrived at the resort to see alot of my fears were unfounded. When we stayed recently there was a conference on & the resort was fully booked at some times however it was never too busy to get a seat by the pool or space at dinner. The staff were generally always courteous. We had a fabulous time & would definitley visit again given the opportunity. Notes: some reviews mention the birds - they are noisy but only for about 30mins at dawn and dusk then they settle down, also we were in ocean tower and couldnt hear them when the doors & windows were closed. re: the tram/monorail/boat - these are a great addition for when you don't feel like walking but it isn't far to walk from one end (ocean tower) to the other (lagoon tower) and can easily be done in a leisurely 20 minute stroll.We felt breakfast was most expensive, we visited the supermarket at Kings Shops & Queens Shops ($2 shuttle from lower lobby every 20 mins) and picked up breakfast items & kept them in the mini bar to avoid the extortionate breakfast prices. ", " Trams, boats, beauty and tons of adventure! Friendly staff go out of their way to help you. We ran into the new hotel operators and he was so accomodating and informative that we felt at home in this huge establishment. I can only say that it is impeccable in so many ways. If I could change one thing, i would add some food options for families that are a little better value. It seemed a little tough to find that great ice cream or amazing burger that you crave after a day a sea or land exploration. A pricey resort but worth the money if you want a special stay. It happened to be our 35th Wedding Anniversary! Perfect! ", " Excellent, well decorated with art masterpieces of worldwide artists, charming hotel. Pleasant pool and pool bar with whatever you like beverages and snacks, comfortable shuttles across the entire hotel gets you all over hotel's attractions. Comfortable and spacious rooms, air conditioning. ", " Patience or energy is a prerequisite if you plan on fully enjoying this massive resort. By far the biggest resort I have seen, it could be compared to grouping three standard resorts on one organized piece of land. Starting with transportation, you have the option of a really nice airconditioned tram or a boat. There are easy to read computerized schedules in front of each stop that informs you of the wait time for either direction. If you choose to walk the art and decoration of the emmaculate grounds and hallways are a treat by themselves. There is also a trolly that takes guests to the Queen's Market, King's Shops, and the Marriot for around $2. In addition to that there is a shuttle service that takes you to \"A Bay\" which is a nice beach between the Hilton and the Marriot. The parking lot is absolutely massive so if you bring a rental plan on paying a couple extra bucks and just use vallet. You can call ahead and they will have your car ready in advance so you dont have to wait, big bonus right there. There is a nice big breakfast buffet on property. So its way over priced at $30 but if you book through Hilton you can prepurchase vouchers at a decent discount. The water toys/equipment is also over priced. You can get 50% discounts for them through Hilton if purchased in advance as well. Otherwise I suggest using the gear shop located in the Queen's Market. The restaurants on property are all pretty nice as well. If you want to save some money there is a full grocery store at the Queen's Market that also sells pre made food both hot and cold, each room has small fridges for food and beverage storage. Check the Hilton website for the features that you get with your daily resort fee. One of the nice features is the use of the DVD kiosks that are located at each tower. You get a card that you put in the little \"Red Box\" type kiosk and can rent up to two movies/video games at a time for no additional charge. You will see there are several pools on property and a fairly large ocean fed lagoon. The lagoon is perfect if you want to teach your children how to snorkel or stand up paddle. There are several turtles, eels, puffers, and other sea life to enjoy. If you are interested in the on property dolphins and are thinking about spending the money to swim with them, keep in mind that you dont actually get to swim around with them and its not really one on one time but with a small group. There are local charters in Kona that cost half the price and will cruise you out to the dolphin pods off shore. here are wild cats and mongoose on property as well but they kept to themselves and were not aggresive. I'm assuming their existence is why I did not see any of the small rodents that you can see in other areas of the island. Kona is about 25-35 minutes south and I don't believe there is a lavish resort in the city so as far as location its not bad either. If you get tired of the lagoon and \"A Bay\" the closest sandy beach is about 15-20 minutes north. If you have a late flight out like we did you have two options. As soon as you check in see if you can get a late check out, or you can also have the hotel watch youe luggage for the day while you relax at the pool/lagoon and then you can use one of their changing rooms when you are ready to leave. Its a full regular room where you can shower, change, and relax while you wait for your family to get ready. ", " This hotel has everything - pools, good restaurants, great service. The rooms were very roomy and the \"ocean view\" was truly a spectacular ocean view. It is so big that you can spend a different day by each pool and feel that you've been at a new hotel. It is perfect for families of all ages, especially multi-generations, because there is so much to do. The hotel accommodated our connecting rooms and the kids were happy. The food at all the dining establishments was top notch (not typical hotel food) and the attention to detail was great. Nice touches made family life easier - a free DVD check out kiosk, open view to the dolphin pools (unlike other hotels that hide their pools except for those paying to see them), air conditioned tram, coffee kiosks throughout the resort, kid and adult-friendly food at the same places. We paid a pretty penny, but we'll be back for sure! ", " We stayed as a group of eight and had an absolutely fantastic time. Staff are very helpful and hotel offers everything you could possibly want to do on a holiday. We were disappointed we were not able to stay longer to fit all of the activities in. We will definitely be back. Highlight of our stay was the dolphin experience and of course the climate. ", " the hotel is a little bare on the outside but the amenities are very nice. there are different pools for kids and adults. Very interesting to have art exposed while you move from a tower to another. Room was very clean and housekeeping service excellent. The only problem we had during our stay was that the shower door was leaking water in the bathroom. It wasn't too bad so we didn't say anything. Overall very good experience. ", " This place is just overwhelming, in a good way. I've stayed here three or four times, and I still don't know if I've seen all of it. This place was built to be kind of like a little city unto itself and it succeeded. The architecture is grandiose, you lose track of the number of pools, and god help you if you try to walk from one end to the other. Luckily the have awesome little water taxis and a little tram that runs from one end to the other. If you do end up walking, take a moment to check out some of the hundreds of works of art (sculptures, paintings etc) that adorn the main passageways to and from the main towers...pretty cool and unique to this property. The rooms are nice enough, but you can't help but feel a little let down when you transition from this jaw-dropping outside experience that they've created to a very standard Hilton hotel room. Not a complaint, just being honest that the awe-struck feeling does not transfer to the hotel room. The only complaint that I had during my multiple stays was the restaurants that were on the property. Please do not get trapped into thinking that you have no other options but to eat at the hotel, because if you succumb to that feeling, you'll end up paying way too much for some occasionally awful food. On the whole though, it is an awesome place, very kid friendly, and a place that I would gladly return to. ", " My wife and I just spent 8 days at the Hilton Waikoloa on Hawaii's Big Island. We are very frequent guests at Hilton hotels worldwide, including some of their resorts, but this one takes the cake! Granted, it is huge and takes a few days to get used to its numerous pools, restaurants and activities. But it is just a beautiful place. The art collection is really incredible and anyone interested in fine arts, mostly from Asia, should take time to look at it. We stayed at the Ocean Tower, served by train and boat (yes, you read well: by train) from the main lobby. Rooms are not new but well maintained and spacious. Make sure you have an ocean view room, even partial view, as the sunsets are gorgeous in Hawaii.The \"KPC\" gourmet restaurant is worth visiting. Pricey but good food and good service. So is the Mexican cantina. The food is good and service friendly. Japanese restaurant \"Imari\" is really good as well. We booked the Luau show, with the premium Lanai sitting. While the show was fun to watch, we were disappointed about the sitting arrangement and the food. For that money (280 $ for 2), we were not expecting to share our table with 10 other people or have only one serving of the Hawaiian buffet (true, the Lanai upgrade gives you table service and you don't have to queue for food and unlimited drinks).As the hotel is pretty big, using the valet parking service is a good use of your money, in particular if you use your car everyday. For those vacationing without children, the adult only pool next is small but a great, secluded and quiet place in the Ocean Tower complex. Worth spending time there. Otherwise, you have plenty of pools to go to, some with slides.Another plus of the hotel is the wildlife. You can of course watch the dolphins at Dolphins Encounter, but spend time around the seawater lagoon to spot turtles, blacktip sharks (they have their own pool...), and lots of tropical fish. The birds are beautiful and you have quite a few cats and mongoose which are always fun to watch.Overall, a great place with helpful and smiling staff all around. ", " The best hotel I've been to so far (Thanks to my dad!) Their luau is the best in Hawaii! I love their hotel because it is so clean, like spotless clean. Their pool is amazing! View is fantastic! It is just very laidback and I love their lagoon and the boat that brings you to any part of the hotel. Downside is they didnt offer breakfast. ", " I would return in a minute! Well maybe a long plane ride. Awesome amazing hotel...service was spot on.. Ate at every restaurant... Happy with all of them..be it a hot dog at the pool or fine dining in the fancy restaurant. Thought the trams added to the experience..and saved my feet. Best view ever... Loved Buddha Point. If anyone complains..it's just because its their nature... This is paradise and your on vacation....relax and have fun. Hawaii isn't cheap...I hope that's not a surprise to you before you go...they have to import almost everything...except pineapples and coffee..which are delicious here.. Do have some. ", " we loved this hotel. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower partial ocean view on the other side of the birds...Did not hear a thing...Loved the housekeeping staff...So friendly and sweet and made our room so fresh and lovely every day...Bellman, awesome...5 stars gentlemen....Loved the beach...Yes there is a beach...Yes the Tusumani took alot of sand away but you can still go into the water and hear nothing but silence, magical...Cuz all the kids are far far away....Be sure to bring water shoes, closed toes. 'Food was excellent!!!!!! Portions huge...I will be back...Loved the big Island Loved the Hilton...Thanks for making our holiday so special!!!!!! ", " We had the 5th floor of the lagoon tower in room 5302. The room was clean, very comfortable and the furnishing was in excellent condition. Its a huge resort so yeah you'll do some walking to get anywhere but there is a boat and a tram that will cart you all over the resort if you wait for them. The salt water lagoon is a trip with lots of fish and sea turtles swimming around. The pools are excellent but can be crowded at times usually the afternoons are worst so go in the mornings or evenings the main pool is open to about 10pm and at night its almost empty. The restaurants are very good but expensive. There is shopping nearby at the King's Court and another at the Queen's shopping centers. For more choices you can make a drive down to Kona. The staff was outstanding they were always helpful, smiling and very polite. ", " 10 years ago, I married my husband at the chapel on this property. For our anniversary, we returned with our daughter to celebrate. From the dolphins on the property, to the boat rides, monorail, and lagoon... you just can't go wrong here. It's definitely a family friendly resort. Plenty of restaurants on the property to choose from. And the views are stunning! ", " This resort is amazing. When we first got there, it was overwhelmingly huge and it seemed too big, but after a day or so, it was easy to get around, great staff, rooms are beautiful, pools are plentiful, spa is superb . . . There are two ways of getting around -- by boat or by \"train.\" Most of us come from our busy day to day lives and are not quite unwound yet, so taking a boat or a train seems a little crazy. Sleep on it and when you get up the next day, explore. You soon get into vacation mode and let the resort work its magic on you !!! The boat rides become a journey. I took them just to see the birds, fish, to get the lay of the land -- same with the train. Then you can always walk around and explore. Then there is the marvelous lagoon. . . WOW! You will grow to love it and not want to leave. ", " This resort is unlike most other hotels as it boats two exceptional modes of transport not usually found at a hotel. Guests can travel on a canal boat to and from the accommodation or use the tram. Both are fun to use and come on regular timetables. There are plenty of choices for eating ranging in price. The added attraction of seeing or even swimming with dolphins is available for a price, as well as getting close to but not touching the wild sea turtles for free. These gentle creatures float by and are inches from guests who are requested not to touch them. The resort has many beautiful rooms. We were originally assigned a room with a limited view but after speaking to Erik (a delightful man at the front desk) he solved this by assigning us a fantastic room with, in our opinion, the best view we could have had. We loved the room and have him to thank for making our holiday stay there so pleasant. Thoroughly recommend this hotel. ", " It is a huge property! You definitely have to be on island time when getting back and forth on foot, in the tram or by boat. But it is absolutely paradise. We had an ocean view room in the tower farthest from the lobby. The view was great. I walk every day and there are infinite places to walk on the property and down the beach. The food we had there was good. My wife likes a good cup of coffee in the morning, and we found that at a coffee stand adjacent to the room. We were only there for 2 days, and I wish we could have stayed longer! ", " We gave just had a fantastic break at this hotel. We stayed in the lagoon tower with ocean/dolphin view after reading reviews that this was the best place to stay to use the pool with big slide. Could't have been better. What a view. Can't believe people moaned about how far you have to walk. Complete rubbish. The grounds are beautiful and it's lovely to walk everywhere. There is a tram and a boat to take you between the different buildings, but it's not necessary. Food was reasonably priced. You can buy a plastic pineapple($15) for unlimited soft drinks during your stay. I didn't see many people choosing this option though. Hula dancing lesson was great. My children did Ukulele lesson and thoroughly enjoyed it. They now want us to buy them one! Never had a problem getting a sun lounger. Water slide was really good.  We hired a car and went for a drive round the island and went to volcano and lava tubes. Although the distance to cover is relatively short, the low speed limit and twisty roads mean it takes ages to get anywhere. We left the hotel at 3pm and didn't get back until 9:45pm. It was still well worth the visit.Free films, Wifi and PS3 games were a welcome bonus.Only a 20minute walk to Queens market for restaurants and shops.Would go back to this hotel in a flash. So much nicer and relaxing a resort than the Grand Wailea in Maui where we are now. ", " This was our second time staying here. The stay could not have been nicer. Needed to have our rooms changed due to a slight injury to one of our travelers and the staff could not have been more accommodating. The grounds are beautiful. Great for strolling especially at night. They do have a tram and boats that can take you from one end to other also if you don't want to walk. The restaurants on the property are good. The salt water pool is great. You can sun, swim, snorkle, rent paddle boards, etc. Nice location with shopping centers close by. Scenery beautiful. ", " With all that i have read over the months in preparation for this trip - I cant believe people complain about the walking you have to do? The property is BEAUTIFUL and very well maintained. Yes - if you stay in the Ocean Tower - which we did - by choice - you end up walking a bit more - but really people. If you are a healthy person the walking is wondeful! Lots of paths and things to see! Plus there are residence feral cats ( some more friendly than others) - but there seems to be a spay/nueter program which is good if you are an animal lover like us. So - we took kitty treats and had a great time feeding the furry faces that appeared at our balcony ever am!Yes - the restuarants on property are expensive but so is HA! We ate at the pizza place - okay. The Mex Cantena in Ocean Tower was very good and I thought fairly priced. Also - we didnt eat once at the over-priced breakfast buffet - we at the cute coffee shacks. Good coffee - I thought and they have a breakfast sandwich and Quiche and other goodies that was fine for us. Yes - you can walk or trolley to Queens market. It has a very nice market for food supplies but it is not cheap. Paid $7.29 for 1/2 gallon of Organic milk for room. The sushi place there is very good! And - there is a Starbucks there for those you care.Really no need for a car - we didnt have one for the four nights we stayed there - there is plenty to do! The pools are great - not sure why people say they are cold but we where there in June and it was 85 degrees out. The bay is wonderful for seeing the sea turtles! They come in everyday and you can get up close and personal! There is limited shade and places to sit in the lagoon area. My husband & I would get up fairly early( 8:00 am) and have a bite then walk down and grab some lounges in the shade. One of us would stay and the other walk back and grab swim gear then walk back and switch. People can be weird if you just put your towel down and leave.All in all we greatly enjoyed the resort. Yes the boats are slow - but we only used one for a night cruise around the resort. And - we thought the trams worked fine when we used for loading luggage on - we walked every where else! If you dont walk you will miss so so much - esp the kitties!Aloha ", " We stayed in the Lagoon Towers. The rooms were recently updated; double sinks in the bathroom and great views if you get the ocean/dolphin views. As far as the walking goes, I was very concerned after reading all the reviews. But it was fine. We're on vacation, so no hurry to get anywhere and they were leisurely strolls. Most were within 5 minutes. If you stay at the Lagoon Towers, there is a short cut to the parking lot through the spa and out past the tennis courts. KPC was expensive but worth it. Get a 6:30 pm reservation and enjoy the sunset. Same for the Lava Lava Beach Club. Not nearly as expensive as KPC, but just as good views for sunset. I would get a reservation a few days ahead if you want sunset times.It's worth getting a car and seeing the area. Beaches just north of the property are Kapuna and Mauna Kea. Beautiful beaches with facilities. Mauna Kea is part of a resort and has limited parking, so you need to get there before 10:00 am to get in, but worth it.Best snorkeling probably in all HI, w/o taking a boat, is at Two Step. So named because there are two ledges that you step down and you're in. It's a coral reef and it's loaded with turtles, eels and all kinds of fish, etc. You can rent or buy snorkel equipment at the resort. It is about a 1 and 1/2 hour drive south, but well worth the trip. You can also stop at Kmart or Walmart which you'll go right past and buy equipment there even cheaper. ", " My husband, myself & our 2 children aged 9 & 17 spent 10 wonderful days at this beautiful resort. We have travelled a lot overseas but this place was the nicest resort I've ever stayed at. Plenty of dining choices in the resort & a short shuttle bus ride away at the local shopping centres. We ate so well with everybodys tastes being catered for. The rooms were very spacious & the staff were all lovely & always eager to help. The breakfast buffet was 5 star with beautiful, freshly made omelettes, pancakes & waffles. Everywhere we turned was a photo opportunity with the landscaped grounds & waterways of the resort as well as the beautiful sunsets over the lava rock covered beaches. Amazing pools with waterslides for the children & the big kids!! Dolphin encounters run every day and you can sit on the grass and watch these beautiful animals all day if you want to. The highlight though would have to be the amazingly beautiful green hawaiian turtles that swam daily in the resort lagoon. They were up to a metre big and they were happy to swim along with the tourists and we were so fortunate to take home that experience and the memories. This resort ticks all the boxes.... Lovely accommodation, many delicious food options, gorgeous surroundings & wildlife, beautiful weather every day & friendly staff. We are planning to go back again next year..... Amazing...Amazing....Amazing!!! ", " Just spent 9 days in this paradise resort on the Kohala coast of Kona. It is truly a great family destination. It offers every amenity including three separate hotel buildings (I had the opportunity to stay in each of them, and while I like my upgraded view of the dolphin quest marine bio-learning adventure in the small room I had in the Lagoon tower, I really liked my second choice in the Palace Tower, a 5 balcony king-bed suite with sleeper sofa and room for a roll away in the spacious 1000 + sq ft. living area the best!!! The Ocean Towers has nice facilities and some rooms with great views, but I wouldn't want to be there too long.Compared to living in a thatched-roof hut on some real tilapia pond like ancient villagers; staying at Hilton HI - It probably seems kind of artificial to some more experienced travelers and certainly to local hawaiians, with it's Disney-like monorail, arrival by Jungle Cruise boats. and things like a built-in artificial salt-water swimming area complete with sea turtles and reef fish may seem 'fake\" or corny - but for my family it was the perfect place to practice our snorkeling and get our sea legs underneath us first before venturing out to more ambitious (and sometimes dangerous) real and public coral reef sites sites like the 'Place of Refuge\" at the south end of the Island and the rock entry 'Turtle Beaches\" of Puoka to the north. Petroglyphs beach stat park just to the north of Waikoloa by Mauna Lani resort is an excellent day trip with safer snorkeling entry points and beautiful clear waters.We did all of these adventures and more (visiting the black sand beach or Pololu after a quick hike down the north end into the Pololu valley). I highly recommend bringing a rental car so you can venture out every couple of days, but I want to assure you that on the days you choose to stay in the resort and chill by the pool or the lagoon, you will be satisfied and relaxed. ", " Five star Hawaiian vacation. Service was excellent. Accommodations outstanding. Food always excellent. An incredible variety of cuisines. Our grandson loved the dolphin encounter. Snorkeling in the lagoon we saw more marine life than anywhere else. Paddle boards and kayaks available. Looked forward to the breakfast buffet when time allowed. Incredible display of Pacific and Asian art throughout the buildings. The pools were outstanding. ", " I love Hilton Waikoloa. It is large, spacious, has beautiful grounds with water and native plants & flowers. The tram & boat rides add to the ambiance. The luau is one of the best I have attended with a great entertainment program-fire dancing and beautiful costumes. The dolphins provide a great entertainment for families and great fun even for non-participants to watch. The staff overall provide great service. ", " We spent a couple of nights there and were totally delighted. It is a great family hotel with wonderful pools, great service and all the amenities. We especially loved the lagoon. Our grandson loved snorkeling in it (we couldn't get him out); he thrilled in seeing the sea turtles and especially an \"albino\" eel. There is a lot for the family to do. The one thing you can't do is lie on the beach and swim in waves (but we expected that since it is the Big Island). It's a huge property but once we got our locations down, we had no trouble finding things. It was fun to see the property after we checked in, taking the boat through the canal. The only downside -- a dirty coffee cup in the room -- whoever had used it before placed the paper lid on it and the maids obviously did not look at it or replace it for the next party to stay in the room. ", " We stayed for 7 nights and had a lot of fun at this hotel. The room was nicely appointed and clean, service was good (once a day, no turndown). We had breakfast each day at Big Island Breakfast, the breakfast buffet there which was included in our package. Access to the big pool and lagoon was easy from our room. The hotel has a nice \"lagoon\" with sea turtles, a reasonable number of tropical fish and eels well protected from the ocean (great for kids). We also enjoyed Dolphin Quest where our son was able to meet and kiss a dolphin! We agree with other reviewers that the Hilton Waikoloa is a great place to just plop down for a week and swim and play with the family. We did take one trip out to Hawaiian Volcanoes National Park, which was a 2 1/2 hour drive through Hilo. ", " 1. The lagoon connects to the ocean so tropical fish and 10-15 green sea turtles visit daily.2. Lagoon is perfect place for kids to learn to snorkel before heading into the open water.3. Grounds are gorgeous and designed to muffle noise.4. They make a killer Blue Hawaiian.5. LOTS of things for kids to do so mom and dad can relax, too.6. It is sunny 95% of the day in Waikoloa Beach area. Further south around airport and further south it is grey and rainy during the summer.7. Seven restaurants on site so you don't always need to leave the grounds (though I still recommend dinner at the Four Season's Beach restaurant, and the Lava Lava Club next to the Marriott).8. Dolphin interactions that are open for all to watch (but I preferred Sunlight on the Water's dolphin swim in the open water...they are located at the marina just south of the airport. We swam with 12 dolphins and saw a manta ray).9. Closer access to Hilo which you should visit to see the botanical gardens, PLUS go further south to take a boat tour to see lava entering the ocean - incredible!!).10. Amazing fire torch dancer at luau on the property.11. Comfortable beds.12. Refrigerator in room for waters and juices.13. Some money saving opps such as $10 pop bottles for kids to have pop during entire stay, and $10 off breakfast buffet if there before 7 am (works for early birds)14. Really nice staff, especially the valet guys.15. Drink service at the pools and lagoon beach.Other tips for Big Island: Best body surfing at Magic Sands near Sheraton, great snorkling at Captain Cook bay, eat at the Shack south of Kona in coffee country, try Donkey Balls, Ultimate Burger in Kona is good, drinks at the Fairmont are good, avoid the Marriott buffet (bad), Lava Lava Club is sensational and kid friendly, Junior Rangers should do all 5 NPS parks - they hand out prizes for free including a cool water bottle. ", " This place is just plain awesome...but exy on some things but its hawaii. Loved that there are plenty of pools and transportation is great. Food is really good and shops nearby. Overall our family loved it. ", " enjoyed our stay try more things looking forward to staying again and trying even more things on the next stay. our guests enjoyed their and stay will come again I believe, they did the Dolphin quest, next time I will or hope too. staying at this hotel is better than bring our guest home everyone enjoys free time. WE ate at the Japanese resturante and truly enjoyed our meal it was excellent and cooked to perfection! we did the breakfast buffet that was filling and we skipped lunch we were so full, WE ate one breakfast in our room the service was excellent the food hot and wounderful, would have liked for the dishes to be taken that day they stayed in the hall for hours and made the hall look unkepted. good way to get bugs with food and dirty dishes hanging about. They were finally gone by 1030pm. The KPC steak house was wounderful the food and we saw the fireworks from our table on the 4th, we also saw another fireworks down the coast. our guests used the spa and truly enjoyed it. our over all stay was excellent we shall return without guests just so we can enjoy a little rest and swimming our pools are so big they are not crowed so they are enjoyable even with kids jumping in and out of the water. ", " We stayed at the Hilton for the first stage of our trip for one week. It was amazing,but don't go there if you are going on a budget and are going to penny pinch.we expected to tip all the time and were glad to do so because the service was beautiful,the nicest people I have ever met and genuine. The food was amazing especially at KPC and Kirin.the shopping is down the road and is nice,but not really the island for shopping,just for relaxation.our travel agent planned it to a T we went to Oahu for the next week. There for the shopping and pearl harbour,then home ", " Stayed April 2012. Our room over looked the dolphins and the ocean. Stayed away from the birds which was recommended by Trip Advisor and am very glad we did. They were loud. The room was perfect! They brought a roll away in for our 11 yr old and she was comfortable. I wouldn't recommend it for teens or older though. Our king size bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The couch pull out was great for our 13 year old. There is so much to do here that it's difficult to leave to see the rest of the island. Our travel companions didn't leave one day. They opted to stay and enjoy the pool and lagoon while we went to Kayak to Cook's Monument. The breakfast brunch is SO worth the cost if you can afford it. You won't need lunch. Eat that brunch and wait for dinner. So good and the wait staff there is exemplary! Yes, you will walk to get around this resort. I can understand if you are elderly or disabled...this may not be the place for you. If you're just a lazy vacationer, don't stay here. The activity was exhilarating and I slept sound after a day of it! ", " Researched this once in a lifetime trip for over 6 months. WAS NOT disappointed. Just know what you want!Dolphins: do it. Animals treated well and not one disappointed face (adults included). If you can't afford it this trip, just go have a lunch or an ice cream by the lagoon and observe. They are amazing to watch!Transportation: Even after a week, my 9 and 11 year olds didn't mind the walk. If you are tired, take the tram or boat (or have groceries or luggage) Yeah, Yeah the resort covers 62 miles, but I doesn't take more than ten minutes to walk from one side to the other on the trails. And it's Hawaii--fantastic view from any angle.Luau-Best bang for your buck on the entire resort. Reserve the Alli seating--worth it. Even at the cost, food comes non stop, service impeccable, entire table must have had four to five drinks each (included in price) and show was entertaining and fantastic. We also got a fantastic sunset as the show began. Absolutely no complaints! DO it!BUY THE FOOD DISCOUNT CARD! $30 when you check in (Gives you $20 in vouchers and a card for %10 percent all other food (including luau!) at the resort. Then drive or take the tram to Queens market for snacks, drinks etc. BEWARE--it is Hawaii. A bottle of juice will cost you $4 but it's cheaper than going to Coffee shop every morning for a smoothie for your kid (Mine became addicted!) Tip: have everyone in party take a picture of 10 percent card on your phone and show everywhere you buy food. We saved a fortune!If you can afford it, eat at KPC. Check sunset time and book dinner for $15 before. Favorite part of the trip. ", " We spent the second week of our two week Hawaiian Islands vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. This was our second Hilton Resort in Hawaii on the Island of Hawaii (The Big Island) Again on the whole our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village was excellent. It's location on the west coast of the Big Island, an oasis, so to speak in the middle of old lava fields.. It is an even larger property than the Hilton on Waikiki; however, this gives it a completely different favour than the Hilton at Waikiki. The only small problem we experienced on arrival at the Main Desk/Lobby is our rooms were not vacated yet. We were hot and hungry (with children) and The Front Desk Lady directed us to a restaurant that was not in operation and had not been for some time. It took us 45mins to locate something open, all the while wishing we could jump into a pool to cool off. I know it seems petty, but the Hotel should be ready to handle early arrivals better, it's not like you are downtown somewhere. There is a nice venue right next to Lobby which was only open at night that could be utilized for this purpose. Our rooms in the Ocean Tower were nice. The view was just an ocean view legally, however, on the balcony you could see out over Buddha Point. The beds were great, even the extra roll away bed was comfortable. The resort was very clean, and the service, besides the check in problem, was very friendly and helpful. This I attribute to the staff's professionalism, and pride in the resort and Hawaii in general. Just as a few examples, debris from plants and garbage etc. seemed to magically disappear from the pathways, as for our maid service was very good at meeting our needs, which were quite varied due the nature of our group. We were a family reunion group of 8 people, with children, to Grandparents, and we had no shortage of things to see and do, especially if everybody likes to swim. The tramway which runs the length of the resort came in handy and certainly was a useful and novel addition to the resort, as was the boat canal which cruised beside the tramway. I personally got a kick out of vocal door warnings on the Tram, as they sounded just like Sulu from Star Trek, George Takei. Make sure you check out 'A' Beach at the Marriott next door. Security on the resort was well executed.  As for the food venues, if you plan on eating mostly at the resort, ask for the 20% off coupon for hotel guests. It makes eating there worth the money. The Big Island Breakfast at Water's Edge was how we started our days on the Big Island; while pricey they have included an a la carte menu as promised. However, given the choice, go for the Buffet and the Fresh Omelette Chefs. The Buffet turned out to be a value especially when having two meals a day and using the Coupon. I really liked the staff there as well; they really made us feel at home. We also ate at the Boat Landing Cantina, The Lagoon Grill and at Pizza Place, the last two several times, the service and food were good. The Dolphin Quest was pricey but well worth the experience. The animals were clearly well loved and cared for. The staff were friendly, professional, and especially helpful when my elderly mother decided it was too scary and was going to leave. They expertly helped her, and all of us, enjoy the experience of a lifetime. All and all I believe the Hilton Waikoloa Village was a good value, especially for Hawaii. I'd say it would be good for everyone no matter the size or ages of the group providing you like trains LOL. We enjoyed our stay there and will return hopefully soon. ", " We have three boys, 4, 8, 12 so we decided to stay at this resort in 2011 based on the resort size, pool features, lagoon, boat, and tram. We absolutely LOVED our stay! There was always somewhere new to walk, something interesting to see, and somewhere yummy to eat! The breakfast buffet was the highlight of the morning for the boys and on the way back to the room, we would walk along the lagoon to see the ocean life (and feed them bread!) We rented SUPs and kayaks in the lagoon. Our 5 yr old loved the turtles who are very friendly as they swam alongside his kayak. The pool slides and cave feature was a double plus for our boys. There is something for everyone here and we were happy that each of our very different boys were happy to stay here. We stayed here for 8 days. Our room was always clean and room service was quick. We had a rental car so we visited attractions, beaches, and shopping centers.We used the valet service as it was a few dollars more than self parking. We loved that a black sand beach was a 3 minute drive away! We also drove down to the King's Mall to get food and snacks as there were more options for the boys. We returned the next year and plan to visit again this year! ", " Feels like you landed on the moon when you drive out of the airport - lava flows/rocks everywhere as far as you can see. Not much scenery until you get to this resort.This resort is unbelievable! I have either stayed or viewed many resorts and this was by far one of the most visually appealing re landscaping/grounds. It was very, very clean everywhere! It was so beautiful and expertly laid out. The rooms were a really good size compared to most regular hotel rooms. The king size beds are very comfortable. I stayed in the Ocean tower 8th floor and my room wasn't out of date at all. All the workers were exceptionally friendly and helpful. There is lots to do her for kids and adults. There is not too much to do outside the resort other than beaches and tours. There is the Mauna Kea summit and the Volcano. If you are looking for an extensive night live or entertainment don't go here.There isn't much to do at night. Some down sides:- You need valet parking if you have a car and it is 22$ per day plus any tips you give. But I highly recommend it. It is very fast and you don't have to look for you car or walk another distance after making it to the lobby :)- The price of the food is completely ridiculous. 29$ for a hamburger and 21$ for Nachos (for one person)- Resort fee is $25 per day- The trams are really slow and annoying but you can walk. The boats are a little better but don't run all the time. After a while though ( 4 or 5 days) it becomes a bit of a pain to get around. It would depend on how often you go out and how far away your room is.- The fridge in the room is pretty small.- The birds around the ocean tower are extremely noisy at night, you would be surprised. But they didn't bother me. The bed and the sundeck are far enough away from the main door that I could ignore it at night once I was in bed.I would recommend this resort but I would tell you to read the website and determine if it fills your particular needs for a holiday. ", " We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! The grounds are gorgeous and even at full capacity, it never felt crowded. Yes, the grounds are massive. Yes, the food (and everything else) is outrageously overpriced, but there are ways around that. Check in/The Hotel OverallThe staff was kind and helpful. The hotel is gorgeous but far from \"natural\". It's somewhat of a commercial Hawaiian feel. I still loved it. The hotel provides complimentary boats and trams that will take you the 1 mile length of the resort (Lagoon tower to Ocean tower) The walkway is an outdoor museum of sorts featuring various art and relics along the way. If you're staying in the Lagoon Tower, it's easier to walk to your room than to take the tram. However, if you're in the Palace or Ocean tower, I would highly recommend taking the tram. I would highly recommend purchasing the food discount card at check-in! It's around $29 and comes with two $10 vouchers and 10% off of every food purchase at the hilton. It's a great deal that you shouldn't pass up if you plan on eating at the Hilton (even once). RoomsWe stayed in the Lagoon Tower and absolutely loved it. The best pools are just around the corner and the lobby was only a 3 minute walk. The only thing we disliked was the AC. It never seemed to completely cool off (although we did have 4 people in our room which could have been part of the problem). We had a beautiful lanai view of the lagoon and the ocean. Rooms provide a mini fridge to stock up on water, yogurt, milk...Pools/BeachThe pools are gorgeous! There are plenty of pool chairs/loungers. Each pool has an area for you to check out towels. Although the hotel is on the ocean, there isn't a swimming area. The swimming beach is A-bay which is just outside the hotel. We never went to A-bay but we heard it was wonderful. If you are going to an off-site beach, you can check out towels just outside the hotel lobby. I decided to drive to the white sands of Hapuna Beach (about a 10 minute drive from the hotel). Parking is $5 for non-residents. Excellent beach!FoodWe purchased coffee and scones/muffins from the Waikoloa Coffee Co. twice and ate once at KPC. Other than that, we ate at the Queens Marketplace and the King's shops which provide more reasonably price food options including Starbucks, a food court (Subway, Ippy's Hawaiian BBQ, Dairy Queen and more), Sansei, Macaroni Grill, and several other cafes and restaurants. Both of these shopping centers are about a mile from the Hilton and provide free parking. If you don't have a car, there is a shuttle that is $2 each way per person. The Queen's Marketplace also has a grocery store to stock up on drinks, yogurts, snacks...Prices are pretty reasonable if you aren't too picky. KPC was delicious and provided beautiful sunset views of the ocean. Make a 6:30 reservation by the window or on the lanai for the best views! Yes, it was overpriced (Entrees are $40 and up). However, it was a lovely experience. CarUpon arrival in Kona, we rented a car and headed to the resort. It's only a 20 minute drive to the resort. We initially used valet parking ($21 or so daily) but then switched to self parking ($17 daily) because it was only a 3 minute walk to the car and we were running low on $1 bills for tips! I've read several reviews that mention the annoyance of self-parking. Do not believe them! Self parking was incredibly easy, and the walk was quick! Just make sure to exit the hotel and walk down the path to the right. The path leads directly to the middle of the parking lot.Renting a car is a great way to travel the Big Island. The roads are great and the maps are easy to follow. Plus, you can save tons of money on day trip tours by buying a tour book and being your own guide. TripsOur first trip was to the King Kamahamaha statute and the Pololu Valley lookout. It took us about an hour and a half to get there and was a wonderful trip. We also took an entire day to drive to Akaka Falls and the Hurricane Volcano National Park. We took the Northern route (through HIlo) to the park and the southern route back to Waikoloa. It took 12 hours total (including 45 minutes in Akaka Falls, an hour in HIlo for lunch, and 2.5 hours at the HVNP). I would highly recommend going North to the Park and South back to Waikoloa as you get to see the entire Big Island! Gorgeous views and plenty of places to stop/fill up on gas/eat. ", " This place was amazing. I don't even know where to start. First of all, as countless other reviewers mentioned, the place is huge. We've been to another large resort, and based on the reviews, we anticipated a lot of walking. The grounds are beautiful, so it's a pleasant walk, but it did get to be a drag having so far to walk. There is a tram, but unless you walk up to the stop just as the tram is pulling in, don't even bother waiting. The boats are fun, and my 6 year old loved them, but they only run from 2-11 PM. It was more of a novelty than a time-saver, but hey, it's a vacation. There are 3 tower complexes of rooms, Palace, Lagoon, and Ocean Tower. Lagoon tower seemed to be the most centrally-located. Ocean tower, which is where we stayed, was the most remote. There are two pool areas, a natural lagoon with protected beach for swimming and water activities, and a dolphin area. Both pool areas have water slides. The larger pool (I think it's called the Kona Pool) near Lagoon Tower has a cool cave grotto with waterfall and a hot tub within. It also has the biggest water slide. The smaller pool, by Ocean Towers, is best for smaller kids. It is really several pools, some interconnected by water slides. It has a very small slide for the really littles- I would have been comfortable letting my son go down when he was a toddler, with a parent at either end of the slide, and two slightly larger slides. Both of the biggest slides at the resort have lifeguards in attendance. Otherwise, the pools don't have lifeguards, so watch your kids.We had a package that included adult breakfast buffets, so we did that. The buffet was pretty good. It wasn't astounding. If we had to pay the adult prices, we probably would have had breakfast in our room, as it had a mini-fridge. This resort also caters to Asian clientele, so there were Asian breakfast choices, which I thought was fun. The miso soup and some kind of savory rice porridge were the best.As for the other dining options, yes, the on-resort food is very expensive, but the food actually is quite good. I had an Ahi tuna burger at the grill by the lagoon, and it was excellent. It's not an all-inclusive place, but the food quality is higher. We found that the town of Waimea to the north had some really decent restaurants for more reasonable prices, but obviously not as convenient as dining on the resort. There are restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity of the resort that are only slightly cheaper. Really, food on the whole is expensive, so keep that in mind when planning. Since there is a mini-fridge in the room (at least in Ocean Tower), it is possible to buy food to eat cold. We did that a couple of times for lunch, and it was nice to just run up to the room and grab a couple of things and have a picnic by the pool. If you are a devoted beach bum, know that this resort does NOT have a sandy beach. The shoreline is lava rock, and some areas do have pretty neat tide pools. There is a natural lagoon with a sand beach, which was perfect for our 6-year-old who is not quite up for waves and surf. We went to a resort in Mexico that had a beach, and he really didn't like it at all, so no beach was no loss for us. There are sandy beaches within driving distance, but we didn't end up going.Dolphin Quest is at the resort, and it is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It is expensive, but worth it. How many people get to say they kissed a dolphin? The dolphin that our group met, Kona, was quite a character. She was totally posing for the camera, and we got to meet her baby, Hali'a. As I mentioned earlier, it really is an amazing place, and we plan to go back. There are so many things to do on Big Island. We have a list of things we want to do next time. Aloha and mahalo! ", " A heavenly place. An unforgettable holiday. Hope I can go again one day. Everything was excellent. I was attending a conference but found the time to enjoy the beauty and splendor of the Hilton Waikoloa village. ", " The hotel in Kona was AMAZING. The facilities, the people, the service, the attention to detail, \"everything\" was wonderful. The pools were clean, the food was great and the view was incredible. Not much of a beach on the ocean, but there's a couple of beaches very close. I would highly recommend this property as we were very very happy!! ", " Excellent stay at a first class resort. Only caveat, be prepared to wake at 5AM when the Mynah birds wake and depart for the day.Lots of onsite activities.We had the very best of service from the staff, food was great with plenty of options including menus for the kids. Tram runns through out the resort making a car totally unnecessary. We look forward to returning soon. ", " My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa VIllage Resort and Spa for 5 nights. There was so much to do and see! The buffet breakfast was brilliant! We looked forward to that every morning! The Lagoon was lovely and swimming with the turtles was so much fun! There were so many great restaurants to choose form on the resort. Having a Luau on the resort was also fantastic. We'll definitely be going back!! ", " My husband and I spent the second leg of our honeymoon at this resort.It was absolutely lovely; however, the resort did not suit us 100%.We stayed in the Ocean Tower with a perfect view of the sunset overlooking Buddha Point, and the staff were friendly and helpful.The issues we had were the distance to designated smoking areas from our room (no smoking on balconies), the extra resort fee of $25 in addition to room rate (seems standard for resorts in Hawai'i), the room rate of $214 per night not including breakfast, and the luau... This was our second luau on the islands (first was at the Marriott on Maui) and we expected a lot more from the Hilton... First of all, they unearthed the pig BEFORE the scheduled start of the show (we considered this to be part of the luau), and we were sat at an over crowded table for which we paid premium seating. We also didn't like the lazy Susan dinner service and would rather have stood at the buffet line.Also, the resort is HUGE and largely wasted on us as we are not the type to lounge poolside or take part in resort activities; however, we spent our last day playing in the hotel lagoon and absolutely LOVED it. There were sea turtles swimming about, and the stand up paddle board was fun (although expensive at $50 per hour [$40 for 2hrs outside the resort]).We did take advantage of their spa facilities, which was absolutely fabulous. I could have spent the whole afternoon in the spa, but there was too much to do on the Big Island.Next time we visit the island of Hawai'i, we will likely rent a self-catering apartment for a couple of weeks, and maybe spend 2 days at this resort.On a side note, the Kona side of the island looks like another planet rather than a tropical paradise, but we absolutely loved exploring the lava tubes, and it was always sunny... We drove to the Hilo side of the island for our helicopter tour of Kiluea. This side of the island was tropical and rainy.We loved the Big Island, perhaps a bit more than Maui, for the diverse landscape and overall beauty. ", " I had a wonderful time staying at the Hilton resort in Waikoloa Village. I came here for an international college conference and was impressed with the hospitality, amenities, and food. The customer service was also fabulous; check-in ran smoothly and check-out was even easier and smoother! Although the process can take some time and get crowded, they always had enough people on deck to handle the crowd and get customers in/out and going. I would definitely consider coming back and staying at this hotel and resort because I thoroughly enjoyed what was offered and what I experienced. ", " This beautiful spa is about 28 miles from the Kona, HI airport on the big island. Prices are typical of a high end Hawaiian resort. Their Island breakfast buffet was incredible, but I expect that at $29.95 a head. The room was spacious with wonderful ocean views and a lanai balcony. The bed was a little hard for my liking, but it does the job. The resort includes multiple hotel towers, a convention center, a shopping center shuttle, several restaurants, and just about everything you could ask for. There is even a complimentary tram that looks like a monorail to take you around the resort. Leisurely walking around the resort there is a multimillion dollar art collection that is just about worth the stay by itself for a real art lover.The activities included a chance to swim with 14 dolphins, snorkeling in their lagoon, fresh water swimming pools, boat rides, and just about everything you could hope for. Hilton hospitality done Hawaiian style within a guest resort. I would recommend renting a car at the airport if you intend to leave the resort, but really it is wonderfully self-contained and going off site is quite unnecessary.I am mobility impaired and found that everything required significant walking and although the resort is certainly handicapped accessible, we didn't visit the best restaurant because of the walking distance. Be sure to pack comfortable walking shoes! ", " We stayed for three days during June 2013, i cannot say enough of how much we enjoyed the hotel, I'm a diamond member and we got upgraded from a mountain view to ocean view, the room was spectacular. Snorkeling in the lagoon with tons of sea life, great casual and upscale dining, tons of shops, right on the golf course, I could go on all day. The only thing is that the resort is huge but they have a monorail / train system to get you to various buildings, also a boat that goes around, these can be slow so sometimes it's just easier to walk. They seemed to keep the families with kids to one side so it was not noisy, we would definitely go back again. ", " You can't pick a better hotel than Hilton Waikoloa. This is a world class hotel and the staff goes above and beyond to make it an unforgettable experience. They seem to have thought of everything. It's a visual feast and it has something for everyone. ", " What is there to say other than if you are looking for paradise, there are many chances to experience it here at this property. This is our third visit to this property and as usual they delivered. This time around we were upgraded to Lagoon Tower Ocean & Dolphin view thanks to HHonors and it was spectacular!! The lagoon and pools are excellent, the food while in the higher price range is always great. Just combine some Costco shopping with a few dining experiences and you can't go wrong. Mahalo Waikoloa Village! ", " Gigantic rooms only seen in hotels built in a bygone era and they are very clean. Perfect location. Beautiful grounds kept very tidy to the point of trimming the grass near my beach chair at the lagoon and showering me with grass clippings and then finishing it off with blowing the rest of it on me with a blower :-/ I forgave, nothing a dip in the water didn't fix, and the grounds did look perfect :-) Decent food, albeit expensive, but it's a resort......in Hawaii, so forgivable too. LOVE the Mexican food at the Boat Dock Cantina. The resort is big enough to absorb a lot of people and never seems crowded. Lovely art filled walks along the promenade in the resort. Or if you don't want to walk, take an electric train that glides along a monorail or a sweet lazy boat ride through the canal that traverses the resort. Don't stay here if you want to move fast or are in a hurry though. This place operates on vacation time not regular time. So get ready to slow down and R-E-L-A-X. Love it here! I only gave the service a 4 because they cut back on the number of boats they operate at one time and the times they operate, making it harder to get one. Wait times are longer. The people who work here are very friendly and accommodating. ", " Having lived on the Big Island of Hawaii for over 30 years, I had the chance to take several of my grandchildren and their friends to stay at the resort and they all loved it - it is the perfect place for a great vacation with children since they are a lot of things to do. ", " Loved the Dolphin Quest and the Lagoon water activities. The staff were pleasent and very helpful especially at the Dolphin Quest and the Lagoon. Beautiful resort. A bit on the expensive side if you ate or shopped there. ", " My husband and I really enjoyed the accommodations. I read a lot of reviews before choosing a hotel. So here's my 2-cents: The hotel is beautiful!!! It is really big so you could experience a lot of great things like snorkeling, swimming w/dolphins, good food, beach/pool time, spa, fitness, etc. but a lot of reviews I read said it was too big and waiting on the tram took forever. I disagree. It really wasn't bad. You would just want to have everything you need for the day when you leave your room if you stay at Ocean Tower or Palace Tower. We stayed in Ocean Tower. AMAZING view!!! and so worth the distance from the lobby. Tony & Roma's Pizzeria has delicious pizza!!! Snorkeling with the sea turtles in the Lagoon was a huge highlight from our trip. We got a package deal through Costco Travel that included the Big Island Breakfast--this is what I suggest doing. They brought us a bill by mistake and we were shocked at how expensive the breakfast is if you pay day-by-day. The Big Island Breakfast was superb, tho!! There was something for everyone...seriously, I saw miso soup on the buffet... If you want to go ziplining or to the volcano park, they are quite a drive (about 1.5 - 2.5hrs). The resort did not feel overcrowded and we really enjoyed that. This is one of the reasons we chose the Big Island. We wanted quiet, serene, relaxing and that's exactly what we got! ", " We spent 7 nights at this resort and enjoyed every minute. We paid attention to other reviews that suggested we pay the extra $5 for valet parking and we were glad we did. There are several places to eat on the resort grounds & the prices range from about $10 for a sandwich or nachos to $50 and up for steak or seafood at the nicer restaurant. Alcohol is pricey so you might want to purchase some at the store. Room has a refrigerator & ice is available on each floor. Expect to be awakened before dawn by the birds. You are in a tropical paradise and there is ample wildlife. Spend a day in a cabana overlooking the ocean. You can use one of the free ones if you are an early riser or pay $50 for the day to reserve one. Don't be in a rush to go anywhere since the resort is large & you will either need to walk a significant distance or wait on a tram. Family friendly place. Those with limited mobility may find some challenges although tram has handicapped cars. Easy drive from airport. I recommend renting a car and exploring the island. ", " Amazing village resort on Hawaii, the big Island of Hawaii, we were on the Island for 1 week, and spend 2 nights here. It is so beautiful, and you have to experience this wonderland, you arrive and get on a little boat that takes you to the area where your room is located, the area you pass is amazing. It got beaches, pools, waterslides, dolphins to swim with, you name it, anything you would want, it is perfect for children. :) ", " Don't miss an opportunity to get lost in the peaceful setting of the Hilton Waikoloa. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. Be sure to consider an ocean side massage upon your arrival. Spend time with Brian and Timmy at the Kola Pool Bar. Paddle Boarding is highly recommended in the lagoon. Spend a sunset with sparkling wine at Buddha Point. Keep in mind, you are on \"island time\"...nothing is fast so be patient with the boats and trains that take you through the property. Though they are slow it will fit in to the right mental framework of a truly relaxing vacation. Meet as many staff members as you can, even take time to speak to Andrew while riding the boats. Everyone is so nice and will share tips with you on how to make your trip more memorable. The property has made a lot of great improvements including cutting back the trees and bushes to make whale watching easier during whale season. ", " We have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa 3 times and it it is a beautiful property. As is to be expected everthing has a price and is generally overpriced (beer is $7-$9, small burger with literally nothing else on the plate $13, Real burgers from $18-$32) for what you get, but you have to accept that when you go there, which is why we only go for a few nights of a 2 week stay. The food there is pathetic and way over priced. Everytime we go, we get lazy and eat on the property only to be dismally dissapointed and vow to never eat there again. We did it again ($170 dinner for pizza and spagetti, 5 beers) and thee next night we scoped out a new restaurant in Kings Market just down the street. I was skeptical that a place called \"3 Fat pigs a gastropub\" could possibly be good. It was fantastic!!!! a $300 dinner for 5 and worth every penny! Eppy (sp?) the Food Network chef is fantastic and we told him so. He says you either love it or hate his food. We loved it, but you have to like and value ecclectic food and dramatic flavors. I have never had carmelized onions like his. He says he starts the carmelizaton process with no butter or sugar and cooks in from 9 am until dinner. The retaurant is only a month old but he sure deserves the attention if you like well prepared and flavorfull food. His Ribeye was $36 for a 14oz vs $58 for a 10 oz on the property. ", " This is a awesome place to take your vacation. so, relaxing, beauitful and a great place for a family. We stood at the resort for 7 days and had the BEST time. My 2nd time and would do it again and again ", " My family had a great time at the Hilton Waikoloa. We enjoyed the pools and slides every night after a long hot day of exploring the Kona/Kohala area. We enjoyed the awesome sunsets form the coastline, and the friendly staff was second to none. My daughters said it was the best part of our trip. ", " my last visit to this hotel was in 2010, my 1st was in 1998, both times i traveled with my Family,this is by far an amazing adventure, the Dolphins, the Buddah Statue, the comfort of the rooms were all as i had expected, the history of the area that King Kamehameha grew up in was explained every where we asked, we visited the petroglyphs as well, food good, but we went off site alot for more local food at Kings court shopping plaza more, my last visit i was able to take my 1st grandchild and she swam with the Dolphins just as her mother had 12 years before, all 3 of my kids have visited with me now as well as my only grandchild, i love Hawaii, i love the people and the culture which are both rapidly changing to be more like the US, but my 1st trip to Hawaii in 1969 as a child will always be the hawaii i carry in my heart. ", " Everything about this hotel, the staff, the grounds, the rooms, the views, the ammenities... all were perfect. Everyone was helpful... this is quite possibly the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, and I travel frequently. They have thought of everything here, and it shows. THe pools are fantastic, and arranged in such a way that they do not feel crowded. The tram and boats allow you to get around nicely, though walking is fine too, because the views are so amazing. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and loved every minute... They even include Hula lessons, Ukulele lessons, and DVD rentals as a part of the resort fee. Fantastic Family vacation... we spent 1 week and still didn't want to leave. ", " This is our second time coming to this resort and won't be our last. This resort offers everything a family can want. It's Disney in Kona:). The staff is so accommodating.This is a place that you will leave with the best family memories. We will be back! ", " We recently completed our seventh trip to the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The property is still the IMO the best overall mega family resort in the USA. We had eight wonderful days on the property, all using my HHonors points \u2013 300,000 points to be exact.Here are some tips to make your stay even more enjoyable.Use the Diamond Vouchers smartly. Diamond-level HHonors (I believe Gold-level too) members get two $10 dining vouchers per day. This is in place of a free breakfast. We use these for lunch or dinner to keep costs down.Have Breakfast Offsite. There is a Starbucks a mile from the property in the Queen\u2019s Marketplace. Your dollar will go farther there. Except for the Big Island Breakfast, the resort is void of a place for a casual breakfast.Double-up on Free Meals When You Have Kids Under 5. Hilton provides free meals for kids under 5, when purchased with an adult meal. When at the pool or lagoon, we buy one adult meal to go at one of the Kohala Pool Bar, Lagoon Grill or Orchid Marketplace restaurants then buy a second meal at a different spot. You get two free kids meals this way.Request the Lagoon Tower. It was remodeled last year, and the rooms are beautiful. This was a major redo, with completely reconfigured bathroom, sink and closet spaces. The other rooms are more 80\u2019s Hyatt in d\u00e9cor and fixtures.Use VIP Mode on the A/C. If you like your room cold, ask your housekeeper to set the thermostat to VIP Mode. This allows you to get the temperature sensor to go down to 60 degrees; otherwise it is limited to 65 degrees. The resort also has portable fans they can provide, as the rooms lack cross ventilation. Also, the lanai rooms (Floor 1) in the Lagoon Tower have less powerful A/C units than the higher floors.Save on Cars & Parking. Car rentals and parking at the hotel can be your biggest cost (outside of that KPC dinner). National Rent-A-Car has a desk at the Hilton. If you are there for a long time, consider renting a car for the first two days, then dropping it off at the hotel. Pick up another car on your last day. You need to book online as a round trip KOA to KOA for the first rental, and Hotel to Hotel for the last day. It probably helps to be a member of the National Frequent renter program. This cuts down on car days and parking fees. Call the National desk just before your trip to explain what you are doing. Honestly, the hotel is so all-inclusive, you really don\u2019t need to leave the property. There is a shuttle to the King\u2019s and Queen Shops from below the hotel lobby.Find Cheaper Gas Before Flying Home \u2013 Near the Kona Airport is a Costco. The gas was 30 cents per gallon cheaper here.Don\u2019t Shop On-Property. Everything from standard souvenirs to ice cream is outrageously priced in the independently run shops on the property. Some items are nearly double what the same item is in the King\u2019s Shops. Ironically, the Marriott\u2019s Gift Shop prices are reasonable. We didn\u2019t spend a dime in these shops.Casual Dining \u2013 The best are Dona & Toni\u2019s and the Boat Landing Cantina. Great food and atmosphere! The Boat Landing Cantina has a Guacamole Dip made at your table that is great. Pizza\u2019s at Dona & Toni\u2019s is tasty and the ambiance is great. The Lagoon Grill is more overpriced than last year and the service not as good. Splurge One Night \u2013 KPC (Kamuela Provision Company) is rated in the top 100 of romantic restaurants in the world, and is worth it. A must one night during the stay!Keep Hounding the Management on Bringing Back the HHonors Diamond Lounge. The lounge (in the Ocean Tower) closed during 2008\u2019s recession. Keep pressure to bring back the lounge. Besides the great food and amazing service, it was fun to talk to other \u201croad warriors\u201d with the same taste in vacation planning.Request Them to Bring Back More Entertainment \u2013 The 2008 recession eliminated most hotel guest entertainment, now limited to the Malolo Lounge. Since this resort is as big as a cruise ship, it should have more nightly entertainment equal to a cruise ship. One tip \u2013 the hotel caters to many big (and I mean BIG) corporate events. There is a good chance one of these events will have a pool party night, and there are plenty of places to sit and catch some if this entertainment. One night we had a spectacular fireworks show!! Keep asking management for more entertainment. My favorite was the Boat Landing musicians.Avoid the Hotel Pools on the Weekends \u2013 This is a good time to plan your off-property activities. The hotel sells day passes for locals, and they tend to take over in spots, especially the slides in the Ocean Tower pool on weekends.The Concierges are Very Helpful \u2013 Many have been with the hotel since it opened in 1988, when it was a Hyatt. The boat drivers are also like tour guides. Andrew is one of our favorites! A relaxing activity is taking the hour ride around the entire property on one of the boats. Be sure to wait for one of the convertible boats.It Isn\u2019t All About Timeshare \u2013 It seems like they are catering more to the timeshare owners, as one of the help desks is now dedicated to timeshare guests. They need to remember that as a Diamond-level \u201cRoad Warrior\u201d I choose to spend up to 75 nights at Hilton instead of another brand. At $150 a night, that is over $11,000 of voting power, more than these so-called VIP Timeshare owners spend with Hilton Grand Vacations in a year. ", " The location, staff, rooms, pool, lagoon, restaurants, etc. were outstanding. Perfect for romance and water activities. The lagoon is a wonderful and safe place for snorkeling (with sea turtles!). Every meal was out of this world! We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and had a wonderful view. would love to go back! ", " We enjoyed an extremely comfortable stay at this hotel...many amenities and good variety of restaurants. Lots of activities available. Clean and comfortable rooms. Transportation around facility by shuttle, train and boat was very convenient. Location on beach fabulous. Adored the dolphins and the availability of viewing them day and night with no barriers. ", " Agree some rooms might be tired (ours was great), but surroundings great. Walk way with cultural objects was so interesting, hotel could actually make more of this. Breakfast not cheap but delicious, and could go for cheaper option. meal overlooking the sunset was very romantic and the issue of my needing (for medical reasons not thru choice) a gluten free diet, was dealt with easily with no fuss at all (couldn't say that about some other hotels and restaurants in USA surprisingly ).Staff were great, very friendly, and when we said we wanted a day going round big island helped us plan a lovely day out, selling us nothing, with advice to eat at some great restaurants which were not aimed at tourists. Spent fab afternoons just chilling overlooking the lagoon and out to sea. Holiday of a life time ", " Outstanding property, can see why it is rated so high.Pros: Exquisite gardens, views, dolphins, snorkel pools with fish and turtles, excellent facilities. Plants maintained so well they look artificial. Nice walkways, fish and birdlife everywhere. Nice boat taxis for leisurely transport to the different buildings, in stead of the 8km/h (5mph) tram service.If you don't have a rental car there is a shuttle bus at $2 each way to the shopping centre 1km away, as well as close beaches. Cons: $25.00 per day service fee on top of room rate - why not include in room rate? Makes a mockery of internet pricing comparisons.Parking $17.00 per day - seriously? After renting a car at $30/day plus $20/day for insurance, another $17/day? Come on!Breakfast at $30 pp - ridiculous. We had no trouble with bird noises, but the tram crossing warning signals outside our room every 10 minutes was quite irritating - ocean view (extra of course) should not have this problem.The place is a must-see, but be prepared for the hidden extras. ", " Excellent hotel boasting all the luxuries you could possibly want. My daughter loved riding the tram and the boat around the resort. Her favourite experience was swimming with the dolphins and playing with the parrots. Staff very well trained and make you feel welcome. A wonderful family vacation spot. ", " Resort has everything you could want. Food prices, albeit at resort prices, weren't terribly unreasonable. Experiences (lagoon, cabanas, Dolphin Quest, snorkeling, etc.) were all terrific. Only complaint is the $8 \"delivery fee\" for room service, which is on-top of gratuity, but that's easily avoidable by simply leaving the room. ", " This is our 4th time staying at the Hilton Waikoloa village and it hasn't failed to impress! We adored our stay, everything from the service to the food to the lagoon. Everything about it is over the top and wonderful. SO many activities for adults and kids alike, you certainly won't be bored with your stay. ", " The staff and facilities were wonderful. We were fortunate that our time at this Hilton property on the Big Island was off seasion making everything seem almost private as there were fewer people vacationing that at other times. Perfect for mature adults having a true honeymoon experience. We loved the children we did see, having fun in the pools and experiencing the dolphins. This was also a great base for us to use to explore the island and experience some of the special places on this island. Highly recommend the valet service...which was quick and helpful. Yes...its $5 more per day...but unless you bring your own teenager to run get the car for you...pay the $5 and enjoy the service. ", " We stayed at the Hilton for 4 night/5 days. It is gorgeous and huge. Another reviewer said that the biggest drawback is that nobody will want to leave the hotel for other activities. They were so right! The pools are outstanding (waterslides, waterfalls, and hot tubs), the rooms are comfy and the facilities are opulent. It is a long way from the parking lot for rental cars to the rooms. The tram is slow enough that you will get where you are going much faster by walking. However, the tram is more practical if you are wearing heels or dress clothes, or if you have baggage. The boats only run occasionally, but are fun entertainment.The lagoon is incredible. It will appeal to children and adults who are nervous about snorkeling in open water as well as more experienced snorkelers who like to get close to fish and other aquatic critters. The food is superb, but expensive. We splurged and ate once at the Lagoon breakfast buffet. The service is amazing, but it is not practical to eat there daily because of the cost. There is a market within the Waikoloa village with great tasting (and less expensive) food - you'll just have to be willing to walk or bike a mile or take your rental car to eat there. ", " This is a very nice hotel, especially for families with kids. The hotel artwork is first class and the surroundings are beautiful. Having the Dolphin Quest at the hotel was a plus and the swimming pools were great. I'd definitely recommend it. ", " This was our first trip to the big island. My husband and I loved this property. We arrived early around 11:00 a.m. We had checked our bags with the bell captain and were told they would bring our bags right up as soon as we were assigned a room. We were assigned a room as soon as we arrived at the check-in desk! And they weren't kidding. As soon as we took the tram (last and only time), and unlocked the door to our room, they were delivering our bags! We stayed in the ocean tower on the 6th floor and it was a great location for us. We had a perfect ocean view. The room was quite large. Bathroom was small but adequate. We heard the birds, but they were not a problem. Just reminded us we were in a tropical location!It is a huge property but we found we could just get anywhere on foot quicker and easier than taking the trams or boats. And it was not a difficult walk to any of the other locations. If traveling with children the boats or trams it would be the better option.We spent most of our time at the lagoon. We loved snorkeling with the sea turtles. We rented a cabana each day, but there were plenty of other free lounge chairs available.We were not overly impressed with any of the restaurants. Food was just o.k. We did go to KPC for the mothers day brunch and it was a huge disappointment. The best was a pizza that room service delivered one evening. There are other nearby options for restaurants.We thought the service was exceptional! Everyone who works there took time to inquire if we needed anything, were we enjoying ourselves, etc. Whoever is doing their customer service training is doing an outstanding job. ", " It's my third time in 3 years I write a review on Hilton Waikoloa Village. I visited this resort again in mid May for a conference, and stayed here for 7 nights. The services are again excellent and I would say I like this hotel a lot!Thanks to the HHonor Gold Membership, my room is upgraded to the top floor 8/F in Ocean Tower with a perfect ocean view. I appreciate the upgrade 'cause I would overlook the amazing view of the ocean and golf course! Further, I am offered 2 USD$10 coupons per day and 2 free bottles of water for the whole stay. Though some of the previous reviews complaint that there is no access to lounge even though their memberships are either Diamond or Gold, I do think that it is sufficient to have these coupons 'cause I do prefer dining in restaurants. Moreover, these coupons do help a lot because of the high price charged by almost all restaurants inside the resort. Without these coupons, I believe I would go to the nearby King's shop (mall) or Queen's marketplace for lunch and dinner.The dining options inside the resort are great. 1. I have breakfast in Waikoloa Coffee Co. almost every morning. I love their freshly baked Quiche a lot! The quiche is actually very tasty.2. For lunch, I did try the Kirin Chinese Restaurant and the Lagoon Grill. For the Kirin Chinese Restaurant, they serve traditional Canton and Sichun food. The food is great! I do recommend to dine in the balcony with a great view towards the small river (inside the resort). As for the Lagoon Grill, the drink, especially the Blue Dolphin, is great! I did try a few sandwiches and burgers but they are on average.3. For dinner, I visited both the Dona & Toni's Plaza, Lagoon Grill, and Boat Landing Cantina. Dona & Toni's Plaza is an Italian restaurant that serves pizzas and pastas. The pasta is great and the service is efficient. For Lagoon Grill, maybe I went there late (it's closed at about 7pm), I need to wait for a long time before finding a waiter to serve. Lastly, for the Boat Landing Cantina, it serves Hawaiian food and it is reasonably ok. In addition, I did visit the Shaka Cones next to the Lagoon Grill and tried a very good locally made Ice Cream, Kona Moach Brownie. It is very tasty and I love it very much!Further, I did visit the Kohala Spa and booked a 80-minutes Lomi Lomi Hawaiian Massage. It is excellent and I do feel refresh especially after attending a week-long conference! The fitness center and the spa area (steam room, sauna and whirlpool) are both very good too.In summary, it is a great resort that worth visiting again! ", " Not only are Kama'aina rates priced right, but they also offer Kama'aina discounts on various amenities. There are a variety of activities for the whole family. The grounds are well-maintained and it is really lovely to walk from the lobby to the outer towers and enjoy the artwork that line the hallways and walls. Nearby shops make it convenient and affordable to buy food outside the hotel if you are traveling with a large family. ", " This is the best resort in this area. Best location, amenities, restaurants and rooms with views. Our room was in the Lagoon Tower which overlooked the Dolphin ponds - amazing... Can't say enough good things about this resort. We didn't have any children with us, which was fine as there are many other things to do for couples. If you have kids, this is the place to come. Overall five stars. ", " Absolutely Huge property with plenty of sand, water and art for everyone. I brought my wife here for our 25th anniversary and I have never seen her so relaxed, as there was so much to do so onsite and nearby. Sunniest area on Big Island, wear a hat. Beaches, fish, turtles, food, drinks, hiking, golf, boats and snorkling were all within 1 Kilometer of our room, so we did not drive our rental car for several days. Money Saving Tips: Great food deals and a free cup of coffee at the Queens Market, a 10 minute walk or easy shuttle ride, a big savings over the Big Island Breakfast. Try the Mexican Canteen in the Ocean Tower for Happy Hour drinks and Nachos plate, it is a bargain! A Bay is a 10 minute walk along the ocean with concessions, boats and more snorkling. Best Resort Drink: Mango Mojito, Blended - WOW!Best (Nearly) Free Amenities: Ride the Canal Boat from bar to bar at sunset :^) and take a sunrise hike around the grounds. ", " We were staying on a reward and got there around 3PM. Our room was not ready and we were upgraded and given vouchers for breakfasts for our stay. Everyone on the property was just incredibly nice and very helpful. This one was gratis but we will be back for sure. ", " We stayed 1 night at the beginning of our first visit to the Big Island. I would really recommend 2 nights minimum. The grounds are so beautiful and vast - so much to do!We stayed in the Palace Tower, which was comfortable and okay, but nothing super luxurious - but you don't really want to spend a lot of time in your room! I would check out the Lagoon Tower next time, just based on its location. The tram & boat were fun ways to get around. Loved all the artwork, and landscaping details. Birds in the lobby were fun too.We had added the breakfast to our room, and it was a good choice - lots of yummy food. Prices for kids was reasonable ($10). One big complaint is the water temperature of the pools - ice cold, and I mean freezing! Even our 6 y o complained, and she loves swimming. Maybe the Hilton can look into some solar heating, but the pools are just so big...We returned a few days later to go to the Dolphin Quest. Highly recommend! They offer a wonderful education program prior to the dolphin time. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a genuinely beautiful resort. The grounds feature wonderful gardens; superb landscaping; really well d one walkways and breezeways including the exceptional grand colonade. There are plenty of restaurants catering for a wide variety of tastes and budgets. nWe particularly enjoyed the Mexican-themed cantina and the Chinese restaurant ( at which we had dinner overlooking the lagoon area at sunset and a decent yum cha lunch.The rooms are a bit tired, but the splencour of the environment more than compensates for that. We overlooked the golf course on the ocean side which was reached either by tain or boat (or a very enjoyable walk which we did often). Small bathroom area but a basin/bench area outside it was fine, as was the luggage storage and clothes hamnging/storage area. Bedroom area was laqrgish with a sofa and king bed; good cable channel selection including premium movies. DVDs were free - two per day and everything we wanted was available from the machine!Each area has a remote lobby which is great as the main lobby is a way off. We needed a corkscrew which we asked for at main reception, to find it in the room whhen we arrived there after the lovely walk. That greatr service was a feature of the resort.There is a magnificent salt water lagoon and beach for swimming, with a lrge free-form pool on the lagoon side which has a good waterslide for adults and kids alike to enjoy.Thge Hilton is a nice walk from the Waikoloa shopping centres (Kings Shops and Queens Village) which are served by a local shuttle ($2 one way pp). Good grocery shopping and some good restaurants.We really enjoyed the resort and the friendly, helpfukl staff enormpusly and have no hesitation recommending it to families and couples. It is great! ", " What a wonderful hotel! This was our second visit in 7 years and we enjoyed it even more the second time around. The grounds are enormous and meticulously manicured, but in a good way! We had so much fun just strolling back and forth across the property, looking at all of the wonderful artifacts, statues, lawns, birds, ocean, cats (:-). As others have mentioned, take your time and enjoy the scenery. If walking is an issue for you, they have both a tram and a boat to move you across the hotel, which is a fun novelty. Everywhere that we ate was excellent, but the highlight was dinner at Imari. We had the traditional dining and the sushi and sashimi were incredible. Our server was Matsuki and she was perfect. We met Executive Chef Charbonneau while there and tip our hats to the changes he has made to the dining experiences since our first visit! Overall, every team member that we encountered at this hotel delivered first class, friendly and caring service. Kudo's to all!! ", " Honestly folks, you will not find a better resort for the complete vacation experience. This property is huge and offers something for everyone. The Lagoon is great for safe snorkel experience for adults and kids. So many pools, amazing spa, lots of restaurant options, views at every turn, monorail and boat to get you around, hammocks, gardens, this list goes on and on. The rooms are clean and comfortable, staff is efficient and friendly. You can do it all here. Pool tables, water slides, paddle boats, walking and running paths, shopping, luau, golf. This Hilton is top notch and does not disappoint. Swim with the dolphins if you want to fork out the bucks. The resort is close to the local Waikoloa Village with more restaurants, shopping, grocery etc. It is all good so just pack your bag and be ready for relaxation or adventure since both can be had. The resort is large enough that you can find quiet places to yourself and does not feel like a crowded tourist trap. Amazing sunsets and a lovely stay. Only down side is breakfast can be pricy, especially the buffet. Room has mini refrigerator, so buy juice, danish, cereal etc. at market and eat on your balcony. Resort is 30 min. from airport so shuttle to resort if you are not driving the island and want to stay in one place, otherwise if you rent a car there is a steep daily parking fee. Hilton has shuttles for small fee to get to local spots so you can spend the time here with no wheels and still get around. This place is a treat :-) ", " From great restaurants to fantastic pools to seeing the dolphins plan it was a fantastic experience. The grounds are immaculate and so beautiful. It is a huge resort and the use of the tram and/or boats are needed to get around which can be a bit cumbersome at times but they are frequent enough to be only a very minor negative. ", " This was our second 6 night stay in two years. Last time we stayed in the Ocean tower (Ocean View) and this time we opted for the Lagoon tower with \"partial ocean view\". The room was very nice and actually had a wonderful view of the ocean. I must admit, we do prefer the Lagoon Tower location and amenities. It is more centrally located to the areas of the resort that we used the most. This being our second time staying at the resort we know our way around very well now. When you read the reviews there are always a few things that stand out. The resort is big: yep it is big and beautiful, you're on vacation, take the time to look at the well kept grounds and interesting works of art scattered about the property. We are in our mid 50's and had no problem getting around. The birds are very loud: yes they are crazy loud in the center areas of the Ocean and Lagoon Towers at times during the day. Upon closing the front door to your room it was no longer a concern for us. The food is expensive: Yep, if you don't have a rental car, the resort has you as a captive eater. We had the \"Flash Fried Calamari\" at the Lagoon Grill one early evening as an appetizer for a meal we were planning for later. Sorry to say, it was so greasy and unappealing that we sent it back and went on our way. We found the Pizza restaurant to be the best value and ate there on two occasions. It is expensive, but sitting outside in the early evening and enjoying the atmosphere of the resort makes it well worth it. There are lots of great places to eat that are walking distance from the resort and with a rental car your options are endless. One big tip for the snorkelers out there. The ocean fed lagoon is perfect for snorkeling and swimming, it's like swimming in a fish tank. We have snorkeled in many areas on several islands and found this to be the easiest and most fish and turtle filled areas around. It does not make since to me, but it is wonderful. Don't bother going out past the roped area under the bridge, it's not good and the visibility is very poor. Second tip. Use the valet parking, it's only a few dollars more and saves a great deal of time. The parking lot fills up and sometimes will be difficult to find a spot. ", " Fabulous resort with something for everyone! Truly an incredible experience. We highly recommend the newly renovated Ocean view Lagoon Tower rooms, they overlook the Dolphin Lagoon and straight out onto the ocean. they are a \"why leave the room\" kind of room. But you have to leave to experience the wonderful pools and water-slides, restaurants, and nooks and crannies. The trams are a great way to get around, but we loved the boats that run 2pm onwards. Great food and great times!The newly renovated rooms are just beautiful with lots of frosted glass, wood, soft close doors and drawers, gorgeous bathrooms and every touch just right! ", " We stayed at the King's Land by Hilton timeshare property down the street from here which gave us access to this resort in April. Absolutely loved it. The hotel is fairly large with so, so many things to do. There is a tram that goes between all of the towers, reminds me a lot of Disney World! There are parrots in the lobby, dolphins near the lagoon, sea turtles in the lagoon that you can swim with (free of charge, unlike the dolphins), beautiful tropical fish....I saw the best fish while snorkeling in the lagoon here as opposed to anywhere else on the island. The lagoon is fed by the ocean and the sea turtles are free to come and go as they please. They have a pool that stretches a massive amount of space with some waterslides going in and out of it at different areas. It kind of lines the lagoon in certain places so you can almost have your own area in the pool if it's not crowded.Buddha Point is a great place for whale watching if you're there at the same time as the whales. The dolphin experience is pretty expensive as are all of the paddle board rentals. Cocktails and meals are pricey, as to be expected, but delicious. The lava flow is my favorite guilty pleasure in Hawaii. :) There are things all over this resort and it's in a great area, lots of other resort communities nearby as well as the Queen's Marketplace (Macaroni Grill, Cold Stone Creamery, a grocery store with reasonable prices, a Thai restaurant, some little shops) and the King's Shops (Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, I believe, things like that).It's also only about 18 miles from the airport in Kona (an experience in itself). It's about 3 hours from the volcanoes (that is a LONG trip, fyi) and 1.5-2 hours from the Mauna Kea visitor's center (don't miss the stargazing program, though - it's free and begins at 6 and goes on through dark). I loved this hotel, LOVED it. Staying at King's Land, we had the best of both worlds. King's Land offered us two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, two bathrooms, a balcony, and some quiet. The lagoon gets very busy later in the morning through the rest of the day. We were able to park for free at Hilton Waikoloa (with validation from the concierge) AND King's Land, whereas staying at Hilton Waikoloa would cost you something like $17/night. While I can't attest to the rooms or accompanying services, everything else here was fabulous and wouldn't think twice about recommending it. ", " wonderful large resort. It's beautiful and clean and safe with many many things to do!! I would only sugguest not eating at the expensive breakfast buffett which we are willing to pay for something that is vast and tastes good. THis was neither. But we loved our stay, loved the rooms, loved the service, it's amazing. So much to do, never need t leave the resort! Loved it! ", " We really didn't know what to expect coming to the Hilton Waikoloa. We were travelling from New Zealand for a conference and from what I'd read of the place, we were under the impression we were travelling to a fake plastic fantasy land - not our style at all. We have never stayed at a resort and weren't sure if we would like it.Well, even as people who prefer budget travel and off-the-beaten-path experiences, we found this place to be amazing. Yes, it is like a capitalist's dream come true. But it was pretty easy to get used to the luxury. Our room was stunning, the grounds were incredible, the restaurants were great, the boat and the monorail made it so much more fun. The west side of Big Island is a stunning landscape and I we really would like to return and bring our family.We had heard that the food was expensive, but in comparison to New Zealand restaurants it was much the same. Coming from an island nation, we are used to things costing a bit more so thought nothing of the food prices. Petrol is much cheaper in Hawai'i (for New Zealanders) so that was a pleasant surprise too.We travelled as a couple but this place would be great for kids. Amazing in fact. I noticed people complain about the walking a lot in reviews of the Hilton Waikoloa - honestly, it's not even a big deal. We were in the lagoon tower. You'd have to have pretty significant mobility problems or a serious bout of laziness to find the walking a problem. It never took us more than 5 minutes to get to the main lobby. . If we felt like making it more leisurely we took the boat. There is free wifi at a bunch of spots around the facility. The pools are excellent. So are the poolside bars! Great service too. I told my husband that when I get old I want to move in to the Hilton Waikoloa and stay there permanently. I meant it. We will definitely go back. It's like another world, a fabulous one. ", " First anything outside of any of the hotels in this area, not very pretty at all, in fact was very surprised to see the surrounding area, but once you turn in to the resort, it is gorgeous, beautifully landscaped down to every single spot on this property, the detail was incredible, lots of art work, you walk around and wherever you look its beautiful. The place is huge, so expect a lot of walking or there is a tram and a boat, but out of the 7 days we were there the boats only were operating one day. The pools are very nice, but the water was very chilly. We had a huge room that faced the ocean, bed was very comfortable. We went to many other hotels in the area, and this one was definitely the nicest at least the grounds. Buffet breakfast was great, kind of costly if its not included in your stay. You must have a car to get around. Plenty of restaurants to choose from though we did go to other restaurants at other hotels. ", " Just got back on Tuesday from Kona. We arrived at bout 8:00 pm and rented a car first from Alamo. Took way to long to get the car, but that's ok. The drive from the car rental, which is not even 5 minutes on a shuttle from the airport, is about 25-30 minutes to Waikoloa Village. At night it's very dark, so watch the small signs for the Waikiloa Village.This hotel is massive and has endless walkways, pools, restaurants, things to do, seating areas and resting places! LOVE IT!! I would definetaly go back. I would caution to everyone that to get from your room to front desk or front of the hotel, we stayed in the Ocean Tower, or to any pool or resetaurant, you have to be in for a 10 minute or so walk or a slow tram or boat ride. There are trams and boats that can take you around the resort, but we found by the time you waited for the tram or boat and by the time it slowly makes all the stops, it was faster to walk. Also, the tram for me was way too cold, the air was blasting and I didn't like that. However my husband did ask the driver once to turn down the air if possible and they graciously did. Now that I'm home, I\"m sad I'm not getting in a good walk every day, so I miss the walks now. They do make the walks incredibly pleasant with all the fine art displays and history of Asian art and many fish ponds along wth walk. The hotel is Asian Themed which is very beautiful and pretty. They do also have some Hawaiian themed pictures and art towards the front of the hotel, which I really enjoyed.If you go to this hotel, you do not have to leave it. No rental car is needed. There are upscale shops that a shuttle can bring you to and from. We ate at Donna and Tony's and had pizza which was very good. We are from Chicago, so we know good pizza. I have to say that I did not like the breakfast buffett at all. It was very pricey, the selection was not vast and by the time you sit down by your far away seat, the food was cold. THey do have an omelette station which my husband enjoyed. The burgers at the outdoor patio near the dolphins were very good. There are cats that walk all around, birds chirping loud, mongoose that walk everywhere, exotic birds all over the resort, But none of them bother you and are actually really fun to see and watch. The staff was really really pleasant at the hotel. I loved the room and thought it was very up to date. Some said it could have used updating, but I think they were comfortable and really nice and clean and actually updated nicely. I would for sure suggest this resort to everyone. For those who say it's like Disneyland, it's a RESORT, so when choosing any resort, I'd choose this one because it's large and beautiful and there is a lot to do. You will never get sick of doing them same thing, if you get bored easily. Lot's to explore! I love it! It's great for just couples or with all your kids! ", " We have stayed here numerous times. The art throughout the property is incredible from statues to wall hangings to paintings. It's amazing so many different pieces are on display. The tram runs all day, while during this stay, the boat runs only in the afternoon and evening. The pools and water features, slides and sandy beach areas are abundant on different parts of the property. The meals are pricey. We always rent a car to get around the island. This allows us to travel to the many sights the island has to offer. Be sure to drive the entire island, there are so many treasures to discover from hidden waterfalls to the volcanoes. ", " What a fabulous place to vacation! It has it all!! The staff,the rooms, the location, the property, the boutiques, all fabulous, and that's just the beginning! I have been to lots of places on vacations but this is by far the best! If you are wanting the perfect vacation spot this is it!! ", " This hotel is the best in the area, with the tram and boat you ride to get around the hotel. The pool has a slide and waterfalls you can swim under. There are dolphins and sea turtles you can see closeup. Fun hotel and a great value considering all these extra bonuses. ", " Yes it is big. Yes it is a long walk and the tram and boat are somewhat slow paced.. But my Kids loved both. They had such a great time. We were looking for something that we could just \"hang\" out. That is what we got.I paid more via costco.com for the Lagoon Tower and got to hang out over the shark tank and the dolphins. My son, wife, daughter and I could just hang out on our patio in our room and watch the ocean, lagoon, dolphins, sharks,,, and sunset... it was awesome.There are turtles and fish to snorkel with as well as paddle boarding or boats to rent etc...There are two main pool areas in which we spent most of our time... It was great. I could watch baseball on my ipad and dip into a pool anytime.Food is good and it is expensive... so be ready for that. But we got free drinks and half off for things by using costco.com.I know that we will be back. Because our 5 and 7 year old had fun all the time.... So many things to do and well worth it. ", " Huge resort with many activities and things to do. Ocean views were stunning. Recommend staying in the Lagoon tower which is the most recent updated building. Staff was very friendly and service outstanding. This was my second stay at this property. ", " Hilton Waikoloa Village is a lovely resort with beaufitul grounds and ambience. The staff is outstanding, happy, and always ready to meet your needs. No need to leave the resort as everything is there. We are seniors with limited walking ability and the trams and boats provided really helped us to enjoy all the amenities easier. ", " It was an awesome resort. Barely 20 minutes from Kona airport with complimentary shuttle. No need to leave the resort. But if you wanted to, there was a shopping area less than a mile away. Gym is fantastic. Lots of out door running paths. Excellent luau. Friendly staff. Numerous pools and beach access. ", " all the staff is friendly and so helpful. they go out of their way to help. the hotel is big and you always have something new to discover within the hotel. the breakfast is very delicious, worth every penny! i totally recommend the luau! amazing show and great food. ", " Attentive staff, comfy room and fabulous man-made lagoon, love it! The resort is large but had a train setup so you can walk of you like, but if you run around all day or have a few cocktails you can sit and relax on the train system. They have a dolphin experience program that is a bit pricy, but that is always the case, and it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience! I snorkled for the first time in the man-made lagoon and came face to face with a giant sea turtle!!! We have been to the resort twice and I cannot wait to return, it is the only property we consider on the island! ", " Spent a week at the Hilton Waikoloa for our anniversary. From the friendly, helpful staff to the beautiful ocean and sunset views from our balcony, across the resort on a leisurely boat taxi and into Malolo for an evening Pipeline or Mohito, watching the dolphin adventure at the lagoon or walking the beautiful art-filled grounds and walkways...the Waikoloa was wonderful. The hotel is perfectly located with easy highway access to get to the many beaches or head out to see some of the many area attractions. There are multiple golf courses nearby (we golfed up-mountain Wa ikoloa Golf Club))and shopping areas area also lose. If you are looking for adventures you can directions to do them on your own or joing hotel-planned trips. The valets are always friendly and get your cars up quickly. We met Rose our first day at the breakfast buffet and asked for her the rest of the week. It's easy to see why she has been at the resort since it opened 25 years ago. Fast, friendly and attentive, she learned our names and was genuinely happy to see us and share our daily adventure stories and was almost as excited as we were about our beach-side vow renewals. Rose is representative of the entire Hilton Waikoloa staff - to a person, they provided great service and we always left snilitng. We enjoyed this trip and the Hilton Waikoloa so much we going to repeat the experisnce next year. ", " I have stayed here 19 years ago, and a few times since and it is awesome.The food and service are great. Don't butch about the prices if you can't afford to be here!The layout is fantastic. Spend the money and get a dolphin view room.This is exceptional value for money. ", " Your property at Waikoloa Village, Kona is most exemplary from the top to the bottom. It is impeccably decorated(I was most impressed with the diversity of the art and statues and collection of pieces that paid homage to the poly part of Polynesia), the pool is phenomenal, and the BREAKFAST BUFFET in the Grand Ballroom was the perfect way to begin each day in paradise. We opted for the Triple Value Promotion Package and would recommend that VALUE to anyone thinking of staying with you and your warm, excellent, and ALOHA~brilliant staff there!! We felt pampered, secure, and most welcome the entire time we were your guests. The last compliment I will pay you is that the design of the entire complex was so tastefully done with its openness and airiness, we loved the grandness of the furnishings and the buildings in that my family and I felt as if we were walking from the beach into a royal sand castle of very discerning taste and of our very own. CONGRATULATIONS on winning over another family of extremely satisfied and embraced guests! ", " Having never stayed at a resort previously, we didn't know what to expect. The Hilton Waikoloa Village exceeded our expectations in every regard. What will stand out the most is the cheery and helpful staff. They thought of ways to help us before words were even out of mouths. There was no need not addressed. The facility is beautiful and well-planned. The ambience was perfect. One could be as busy, or as idle as they wish. ", " This hotel property is well worth the visit, all you can ask for in terms of service, activities. Be sure to take in the nearly 2000 pieces of Asian art and artifacts on display throughout the property ", " This hotel is AWESOME! We have 2 kids (ages 5 and 8) and the locals have nicknamed this hotel \"Disneyland.\" It is perfect for kids. The lagoon was really great for our young, never snorkel end before kids (no waves or currents to deal with, but need to watch for crazy people on kayaks or paddle boards). We swam with turtles every day and saw parrotfish, triggerfish, butterflyfish, bluefin trevally, moray eels, yellow tang and so many more. Great experience for the kids and us. There are 2 pools-the bigger, more kid friendly pool is by the lagoon tower. Highly recommend renting a car to get around the island and go out to eat for dinner. The food at the hilton is pretty expensive for dinner ($30 pepperoni pizza). We rented a Mustang convertible AT the hilton '(have rental office in the resort) and it was so convenient and staff was really nice! We picked up the car from the valet and dropped it off at the valet at the end of our stay. We had too much luggage to fit in a mustang from the airport so we called Laura's Taxi before we left and made a reservation to be picked up at the airport and also for the return. The driver had our name on a card and was waiting for us when we landed. The fare was $66 each way to the hilton. Laura's Taxi was awesome! I would not hesitate to return to this resort-truly an unbelievable vacation. ", " It was our first trip to Hawaii. Our kids were age 8 & 10. We booked an Ocean View Room, and the trip was absolutely amazing. I'm a frequent business traveler, and our family travels frequently for pleasure. While it might not be the \"highest end\" place we've stayed, it is easily one of the best overall experiences we've ever had on a trip. Pair your stay with a copy of The Big Island Revealed, and you will not be disappointed. ", " My husband, our 6 year old and I just checked out today after 7 nights. We LOVED it, and had read these reviews over the last 6 months as we booked in Jan. Those reviewers who complained about the walk to your car, the Disney like feel, and the less than great luau are crazy. I regret that their reviews echoed in my head during our stay! We stayed in the Ocean tower, which was nice and tucked away as if we had a private place (partial ocean view and great view of the lagoon and pools). Heavenly mornings on the lanai! The trains are fine, we never had a long wait! The boats run a little slower but it was fun and we were never in a rush. The pools are amazing, as is the food at the Lagoon Grill. The food is costly but worth it! Buy the discount food card for $30. It gets you two $10 coupons and 10% off all food and drinks for your stay. At the Orchid Market, buy the $15 pineapple cup and get free soda refills for your whole stay and $9 mixed drinks (vs $12). The breakfast was fantastic but pricey so we only did it a few times. Usually ate breakfast in our rooms (bought from grocery store. There's a fridge but no microwave). The pools are just amazing, and the lagoon is a sure bet for easy snorkeling with sea turtles and fish from the ocean. Pay $50 for the day and you can use all the boats and boards at the lagoon. Or don't pay and bring your own stuff like a snorkel and kick board. Don't forget sand buckets/toys! Hidden hot tubs all around with waterfalls at high temps are awesome!!! We actually went to the timeshare presentation, too, willingly! They give you a discount card for all of the activities around the island and we saved tons with that! And a $100 room credit as a gift. And we bought the timeshare, which really was no pressure :) Even of you don't plan to buy timeshare at all, it was fun to look at their new condos (Kings Land) at no pressure To buy. The staff here were all super friendly, we were treated like royalty and the kids are too. Amazing resort, Disney feel but still local culture, don't hesitate unless you're a wet blanket! Only caveat: the alcoholic drinks are wayyyy watered down ;) but tasty. The luau was super fun, we upgraded and don't regret it. This is the place to stay! ", " We have been staying at this property for many years at different times in the year, usually Thanksgiving or March. This was our first summer trip, which we made because of a birthday. The resort is about 20 miles from KOA (Kona Airport) via a moonscape road-lava alongside the road with occasional hints of life-desert-like plants. The volcanos are in the distance. It is somewhat similar to the topography in parts of New Mexico sans the volcanic rock.When you get to the resort (look for the pyramid-looking sign to the left at a light), everything changes and you are in a manicured resort setting featuring multiple timeshares, condos and hotels (the Marriott and the Hilton) and shopping centers-Kings and Queens Centers. The landscaping is gorgeous-trees and plants beautifully arrayed for maximum 'wow' effect. Once you check in, you have a few choices in terms of how to get to your room: tram, boat or feet. There are three towers, Ocean-farthest from the airy lobby, Palace about mid way, and Lagoon-closest to the lobby and adjacent to the dolphin lagoon. Warning to anyone with any type of mobility problems: this resort is huge (62 acres) and if you are experiencing any type of issues (as I was this trip), plan on extra time to get to your destination on the property. Distances between the multiple pools, restaurants and towers are significant and in some cases, you have to travel over bridges to get to where you want to go. Although the trams and boats are helpful, there are some places you simply have to walk a fair distance to reach (the salt-water lagoon, for instance). Also, when there are large groups at the hotel or when one of the trams or boats is out for repair, it is often necessary to walk unless you are okay with waiting quite a while for a ride. The grounds are gorgeous, though, with lots of oversized Asian art throughout the resort and grounds. Lots of great photo ops.Rooms are quite large and beautifully appointed in all towers, with small refrigerators in every room. Bath amenities are great-Kohala Spa shampoo, soap, conditioner and lotion. Commode and tub in a cave like room, double sinks outside. Plenty of closet space. Beds quite comfortable and bedding is wonderful. Great pillows. Towels and wash cloths plentiful and cushy. Rooms have a loveseat and small table with two chairs. Views are good from any of the rooms-either ocean, partial ocean, or garden. All rooms have a lanai. There are safes that accommodate iPads and small laptops. Coffee maker in the room is the type without a pot. Maid service consistent and prompt. Staff very friendly and accommodating. We especially love Kim, in transportation services. There are several restaurants on property and a few in the two previously mentioned shopping centers, Kings and Queens. Prices are quite high and seem to be increasing faster than other parts of the country. We got two hot dogs, a bag of chips, one soda and one bottle of water at Orchids by the Kona pool and it rang up $25. Even the cashier winced. Breakfast buffet is $29 at Water's Edge-we did not partake this trip, although we have in the past and it was fine, if not memorable. We also did not return to Kamuela Provision Company which has a great seating area outside near the roaring surf and is a fabulous place to watch the sunset. Their prices have continued to rise and are now at the fairly spectacular level of New York restaurants and while the food is good, we don't feel it is worth the cost at this point in our lives. Go if you have never gone, but keep in mind the sticker shock you will experience when the check arrives. Kirin is a good Chinese restaurant with some nice lunch specials and great dim sum made to order. Pricy as well, but manageable. Coffee from the Honolulu Coffee Company kiosks will set you back $4 and up per cup, but it is good Kona blend brew. Imari is the Japanese restaurant-we have never eaten there but will probably do so in the future. The Boatlanding is a cantina at the moment (this changes frequently) with decent Mexican offerings. Dona and Toni's (previously Donatoni's) is a pizza place-eat in or take out with some pastas on the menu. We had pizza and salad on different days and enjoyed both. Pizzas run to $30, although if you have a large group I think they have some specials if you order multiples. Many guests purchase food items either at Costco in Kona or at Whalers in Kings Center or Island Gourmet at Queens Center and eat breakfast and/or lunch in their rooms. If you are on a limited budget, this practice will save you a bundle. The hotel also offers a restaurant package deal wherein you pay about $30 and then can take money off several of the restaurant charges-this actually can save you some money if you eat frequently at the resort restaurants. There are many pools at the resort, including one adults only pool at Ocean Tower. Some pools have water slides, some waterfalls and the saltwater lagoon has fish, turtles and a variety of water activities and rentals including snorkeling equipment, paddle boats and paddle boards. Dolphin Quest allows you to interact with dolphins with encounters at different price points. Price varies depending on time spent with the dolphins and numbers interacting with each dolphin. We have done this several times and highly recommend it. There is very little in this world as amazing as spending quality time with these amazing and intelligent creatures. If this is not in your budget you can reserve a room overlooking the dolphin lagoon and watch them play or simply stop by the lagoon and observe during your stay. A word about additional charges: Hilton has added a resort charge of $25 per day in addition to its room charge. This is a common practice at resorts. However, what you get for that $25 is slightly different from other resorts. You get free wi-fi and a percent discount on beach rentals but still have to pay for items such as cabanas (and they added a charge for some of the small blue cabanas which used to be free). So all in all, not such a great deal, but you have no choice. There are two sundries shops at the hotel-one in Ocean Tower, the other closer to Lagoon Tower and their offerings seem to be getting pricier as well. They do have toiletries, tee shirts, and other souvenir type items and sodas, ice cream, chips, etc. The two resort shopping centers (Kings and Queens) have several restaurants and a food mall, so there are choices close to but outside the hotel. We like the Thai restaurant at Queen's and the fish and chips place at King's. These shopping centers are feature coffee stores, apparel stores (Blue Ginger, Tommy Bahama, Crazy Shirts, and a tiny Macy's geared primarily for the Japanese visitor) and the aforementioned Whalers and Island Gourmet (which is part of the ABC chain). These two outlets offer virtually anything you can imagine, from souvenirs to frozen food, produce, etc. There are tons of things to do on the Big Island, from volcano viewing to stargazing at the top of Mauna Kea at the observatories. Topography ranges from desertlike to rainforest to mountainous. There are black and green sand beaches and the most southern point in the U.S. Beautiful beaches, lovely people, one of the cutest towns in the Pacific (Kailua-Kona), Hilo, and the road between. You can spend two weeks on the road exploring or two weeks being a beach or pool bum. One of our favorite places on the planet. And we love the Hilton Waikoloa and will probably continue to vacation there as long as we can afford it and can navigate the distances. ", " We're currently at the Hilton on day 4 of our 7 day stay. I read all of the reviews and was a bit wary since we have no kids and are in the Ocean Tower but let me tell you, the negative reviews are way off base!First, this hotel is amazingly beautiful and has immaculate landscaping and grounds throughout the entire property! The monorail makes it super easy to get to and from everywhere on the property. The ocean tower is the farthest from the lobby, but it is an easy hop on the rail. You can also take it by boat, which you should do at least once as you get beautiful views. There's also a walkway with lots of artwork which you should also do at least once. Based on the negative reviews of the Ocean Tower, I was expecting the worst. But upon entry, I was pleasantly surprised as it was nowhere nearly as bad as some of the reviews. No, it's not ultra modern, but it is very clean and comfortable. The bed is super comfy and we had a nice view of the ocean. The only downside is the bathroom is a bit on the small side but how much time will you be spending in there? Also, the best pool is by the Ocean Tower. The Kohala pool is beautiful with ocean views and seems the quietest.The lagoon is fun for easy snorkeling and has good sealife. I even got touched by a seaturtle (yes, it touched me and not vice versa). Dolphin Quest is right near the lagoon and though I don't agree with dolphin captivity, I have to admit it was pretty cool seeing them so up close (and they did seem happy and well cared for).The location of the property is by far superior to the other mega resorts in my opinion. It's a short drive north to the best beaches. It's also a short drive south to Kona. So it's nice to be in the middle. You're also walking distance to A Bay, a nice relaxing spot by the beach. As far as food, I wouldnt know. My husband and I are foodies, ao I did research beforehand and we've been eating at the local eateries. It's certainly a more authentic Hawaiian experience. Definitely the Da Poke Shack in Kona and Dave's Plate and Coffee Shack in Waikoloa! Lemongrass in the Queens Market near the hotel is also a solid bet! You also save a lot compares to dining at the hotel which seems to have mediocre food and top dollar prices.All in all, this is an excellent resort and we can't wait to return. ", " My wife and I just returned from 8 nights on the Big Island - 6 at this property. Like you, I have been reading the reviews for some time so I had some doubts. Yes, it is big and yes, the transportation is slow. Be ready to walk or be very patient. We stayed in the Palace Tower in the lowest priced room which turned out to be more than fine. 7th floor view of the mountains and so we watched the sun come up every morning. Spectacular. Very quiet, nice room and balcony. It took us 12 minutes to walk from room to car. I had NO problem with birds singing as they recently cut down most of the trees where they nested. I guess mgt. was reading reviews. We swam in every pool. The water temperature varied some but was consistently over 80 degrees. No issue at all. Perhaps it is cooler in the winter but it is the proper temp now. I was told the resort the week of 4/7 was around 62%. No waiting anywhere on the island - this was the perfect time to go. We met with the conceirge the first morning which I highly recommend. More importantly, read a guide book before you go. I recommend Moon's Big Island. We used it extensively. We did not eat at many of the restaurants on site but did get a couple of pizzas at Dona and Toni's and enjoyed them with a half carafe of wine while sitting outside. Actually, quite moderate pricing. By the way, you must rent a car. There is much to see and do on the island. We rented snorkeling equipment from Snorkel Bob's at the Mauni Lani shopping center ( five minutes up the highway at the next exit on left). We then snorkeled at the lagoon ( great practice and lots of fish and also opportunity to swim with turtles) and then also went to 69 beach and Two-Step in south Kona. Both were great but Two-Step is not to be missed. There is no swimming beach at Hilton but you can walk about 20 minutes to A-Beach where there are rentals, etc. Lava Lava restaurant is also there and has happy hour from 3-5. Swim suit at beach table is just fine. Island Gourmet Grocery ( what they call an ABC store) is very nice and is on your left as you drive into the property. Stop and pick up snacks, wine, Poke, lotion - you name it. Prices again were not crazy. Very nice store. Also Foodland is next to Snorkel Bob's and is a very nice grocery with a deli, etc. Both are great for picnic supplies.  One morning we left at 7:30 and drove up to Pololu Valley for hike down to the beach. Took one hour and we were among the first there. Beautiful and nice hike. There are a couple of beaches you can hit on the way back. Stop at the Hamakua Macadamia Nut Company on the way back too. Also, around the corner (so to speak) is the Lunch Wagon - a must stop for fish tacos at lunch. Classic experience. I must also recommend Volcano Discover Tours. We spent two nights in Volcano and did the evening hike with them. Met at 3:30 and finished about 10:00. We had a great view of the lava flow into the ocean and then got up and personal with the surface flow. They had exceptional equipment - like night light head bands, walking poles, gloves, gas masks ( not needed ) and rain gear ( also not needed as it was warm and did not rain ). $175 but well worth this unique experience. We put about 700 miles on the rental but feel like we saw the island. Relax and enjoy! BTW - my wife and I are in our mid-sixties so if you are reasonably fit, these are all activities you can do. ", " We just came back from a 5 night stay at the Hilton and loved it. In fact we were booked for 4 nights and then spent two nights in Volcano and waited until we were on our trip to book our final night. We couldn't help ourselves, we came back to this property. We visited a few other resorts and while they were beautiful, we prefered the HIlton. We are Gold Honors members and they upgraded our ocean view room to a suite overlooking the pools, lagoon and when we stood on the balcony we could see the ocean. The last night we stayed in a top floor ocean view room which was very nice, but I'm glad we had our long stay in the suite. The view, with the two bridges, the pools, the whole resort lit up at night and freshly clean in the early morning hours were beautiful. The bathroom in the suite is awesome as well--it is very large and the shower is wonderful. It was fun to snorkel at the lagoon, the sea turtles are very friendly and come right up to you while you swim. The other pools are very pretty and we enjoyed the waterfalls and slides. Dinner was very romantic at the Chinese restaurant sitting out on the balcony. So much fun to eat there, look out at all the beautiful scenery and then stroll home afterwards. We ate at the Italian restaurant one evening which was very good except for the breadsticks and when the manager came by and asked us how we liked everything, he apologized for the breadsticks and made sure we weren't charged for them. That's good service! We rode the boat all the way around the resort after dinner and it was very romantic. Our last evening we had a sunset dinner at KPC which was also very good. We went to celebrate our 25th anniversary and although we were tempted to take our kids because it looks like it would be so much fun we decided to go alone and I have to say this resort is perfect for either kind of trip. Even dinner at the grill was romantic because we were watching this gorgeous sunset. Prices were expensive, but where else do you get these amazing views! It helps that we were only paying for 2! We will have great memories of this trip forever. ", " I had exceptional help by Mr Ivy at the Waikoloa Hilton on Hawaii working guest services. I had a very tight timeline the day, I flew out of Hawaii to make the three leg flights with two layover trip back home. I talk to Mr Ivy the night before I was to check out. The regular check out time for this hotel is 12 noon. My timeline for the day was as follows: Up at 6:30 am8am-12 noon meetings1pm-4:30 pm Helicopter tour then shower before 5:30pm dinner reservation,7:30pm taxi ride to airport to check in9pm flight leaving I asked if I could check out at 12:30 to leave my carry on bags at the desk (bellman) then get a complimentary room from 4:30 t0 5:30 (which this hotel offers for you to shower and get cleaned up before going out of a flight) BUT.... you can not reserve in advance!! I found out that my reservation was incorrect and the hotel had me staying an additional night at $220.00. I said the only thing that would make my last day in Hawaii easier was to get a late check out at 7/7:30 pm. At first Mr. Ivy laughed like to was not possible.... but he made it possible. I got to keep my room until 7pm without a late checkout fee or purchasing the extra night.My last day in Hawaii went by fast but very smoothly due to have the space I needed. Thank you Ivy !!! ", " I,ve been looking at some of the reviews, and I, sure some people have gone to the wrong resort, I stayed here a couple of months ago, with friends, and have booked to go again with my family in august.Firstly it is a large resort, and you will have to walk, but thats great for you,you can look round the grounds , which are fantastic.Its great for families,the food is first class, but is expensive, but again good value for money, and they did kids food at a discount .Guest service was outstanding,as they helped on flights, and arranged a picnic basket for the kids.plus arrange extra,s for bedding, towels ,turn down service,This time I,m paying for it, all myself, but you can go out,to eat, so i will do this, and i,m sure looking forward to taking my family., and hope they can see the dolphins, etc.craig saunders ", " We had a beautiful deluxe ocean view room. We saw whales from our balcony every morning! The lagoon was awesome. We could snorkel, rent paddleboards, paddleboats, kayaks, or just play in the water with the fish and sea turtles. The hotel is very large, and we did a lot of walking, but I liked that...it helped to balance out all the chocolate covered macadamia nuts. The Lagoon Grill was great, both food and service. Dona and Tony's Pizza not so much. The activities staff offered some fun Hawaiian cultural classes, like hula, lei making and ukulele classes. We loved these! The pools were always clean, and the waterslides were fun. My 7 year old daughter, my husband, and I all loved this hotel. We would stay there again just for the lagoon. ", " The hotel staff was great and very friendly, the appearance of the entire grounds was outstanding. Very neat, clean and beautiful. Food was great. I will definately recommend this hotel to family and friends traveling to the Island of Hawaii. ", " We picked the Hilton Waikaloa because of reviews stating that it had a lot to do for families. We were not disappointed. The hotel has multiple pools with waterslides. There's also a lagoon in the center, which is fed by ocean water and is remarkably clean and clear. It's relatively shallow with gentle waters, so I felt safe letting the kids play in it. Did get quite crowded in the late mornings and early afternoons, but hotel guests were generally very considerate and friendly to one another. My 8 and 3 year old loved playing in the lagoon, watching tropical fish and Honu sea turtles swim by. You can also rent a paddle boat or snorkel, which we did. Beautiful live parrots are on display in the hotel lobby -- something my little girl looked forward to seeing every day. They even got to take pictures holding the parrots on their arms. Some people found the dolphin pools objectionable, but my kids loved watching the dolphins swim and jump at such close range. Rooms are well appointed and clean, as you would expect of a hotel of this caliber. We had a partial ocean view room in the Lagoon Tower great views of the grounds. We dined at the breakfast buffet, which is well stocked with basic American fare as well as Japanese, Chinese breakfast items. Had dinner twice at the Lagoon Grill. Menu was small but of good quality and reasonably priced. We went to the Legends of the Pacific luau on our last night in Hawaii. Luau food was mediocre, show was OK, but overall a lot of fun if only because it gave us a chance to immerse ourselves in \"Hawaiian\" culture. My only complaint is that the hotel (along with all the other high end mega resorts on the Big Island) is fairly isolated, situated about 20 miles away from the major cities, Waimea and Kona. ", " Had adjoining rooms with our children/grandchildren to celebrate our 42nd wedding anniversary. Accomodating staff, beautiful facilities, plenty to do and a tram or boat to get you around when not wanting to walk.Birds and small animals roam the facility as well as dolfin/turtle viewing & visiting. Heard of previous concerns about noisy birds during evenings & mornings but the family agreed it added to the ambience and not loud enough to disturb us in our rooms. Thirty minutes from airport and close enough to easily auto to coastal and mountain plantation sites to visit & explore. Expensive but well worth it. ", " I stayed in this resort for five nights in the ocean tower, and the entire family had a wonderful time. The design of the resort is excellent, and has plenty to keep the kids entertained and captivated (the train, boat and resident turtles and fishlife are a real highlight).The range of restaurants and meal options was great, as was the service and babysitting facilities we accessed from outside the hotel. Would recommend this hotel. ", " Recently stayed here with our 3 children and we loved it. Incredible resort, has to be seen to be believed! Pools and lagoon are amazing - my son loved the waterside!! The rooms are spacious and lovely. We stayed in the Lagoon tower and had wonderful views over the lagoon and the dolphins! Having dolphins there to watch was so wonderful! I could have watched them play all day! Very disappointed that as Hilton Diamond members they did not give us free breakfast, we only got $10 vouchers off a $30 breakfast each day and even then it was only for 4 of us a day. So that worked out at $100 for breakfast after our vouchers were taken off!! It was a huge breakfast with lots of variety... lovely, but no breakfast is worth that much, just crazy! We ended up going up to the nearby shopping center for most meals, as there is a subway and some other options, plus an ABC store where you can buy supplies to take back with you.Quite a noisy place to stay... we felt like we had a bowling alley above us as it was the loudest and strangest noises from the people above at around 5am each day!! We did hear the birds a few times during the night but they didnt worry us much, I dont know what everyone complains so much about, maybe its worse depending on where you stay. The watersports such as paddle boarding etc were fun for the kids but were also costly. In my opinion they should be free as you pay so much to stay there. The most unbelievable sunsets every day over the ocean... really breathtaking! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village provides an amazing experience for vacationers AND for those traveling on business. I recently stayed at the HWV for 8 nights, attending a workshop, and have nothing but positive things to say. I've stayed at a number of resorts around the world, and have rarely (if ever) had such a flawless experience. The Hilton Waikoloa staff are outstanding - Sarah and Cora (in Banquets) went out of their way to ensure that we had everything that we needed, and more. It was a pleasure to see them each morning - they made us feel welcomed and valued. The break 'set-ups' (see attached photo) were gorgeous! Everything about this hotel is amazing - from the food to the amenities to the sights. ", " This was our first time on the big island and first time at the Hilton Waikoloa. We loved it. We liked the Palace Tower location. Really liked the lay out of the resort and all the gorgeous acres. My kids loved the lagoon and all the water activites. A highlight was the Luau. We definitely want to go back. ", " From the minute you step into this resort, it only gets better. Staff helpful and very friendly, activities galore, rooms excellent, food plentiful , overall my wife and I would rate this resort very highly, and recommend it to any traveller who enjoys the finer things in life. ", " There is so much there one review can't possibly describe this grand experience. The complex is huge and luxurious. Every inch was spotless. The artwork is beautiful. Just two of the fun things that help you travel around within the complex are the tram and canal boat. I very much wanted to see the dolphins but nothing prepared me for Dolphin Quest Learning Lagoon. The luaw was a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. A very sweet custom is this. Instead of a \"do not disturb\" sign for your door there are strings of sea shells to use. The aloha spirit prevails everywhere. Everyone should be fortunate enough to go there at least once. ", " My husband and I have spent a total of 2 1/2 weeks at this resort over the span of 3 years. Love the boat you can take to the main entrance. You do walk quite a bit but that is fine except when you are carrying lots of groceries to your room! We got smarter with the second trip and brought a cart. Rooms are not huge but the balconies are very nice. We had a great room at the end of the rooms - very close to the ocean on our first trip - overlooking pool and ocean that was awsome. The second trip we didn't fare as well and overlooked the main buildings. Still nice however. View of Mauna Kea peak. The main pool we used was great and has this cavern with a hot tub and waterfalls. Room service wasn't cheap but no complaints. Had a spa experience and that was wonderful. We really enjoyed our time here and highly recommend it if you are visiting the Big Island. ", " We LOVED our Waikaloa Hilton experience. The private lagoon was such a fabulous feature where we could snorkel with out the fear of a shark attack. Priceless to me as I have had two shark experiences myself in Hawaii. The room was well appointed and I loved the variety of restaurants to choose from...there was always a happy hour somewhere to enjoy the music, fun and hordourves. The swimming pools are very well maintained and we will be planning to go back. ", " We have been visiting the Hilton Waikoloa for many years. There are few hotels anywhere that can compare with the value here. For vacations, the eco-friendly activities, access to fun and adventure, and endless things to do without leaving the resort are unmatched. For business, there are terrific meeting rooms and support. For families traveling with a person attending a conference, there are great activities and the hotel staff is perfect for providing the caring service that every guest wants. This is the only hotel I know where you can view fabulous tropical fish, dolphin and other marine life while walking through the grounds, riding the private launch or rail tram. Not to be missed on any visit or vacation to the island of Hawaii ", " We stayed a few nights at the Sheraton which was OK but we extended out stay on the big Island an extra night. The Hilton was the only place available for us and a little more money than we wanted to spend. However once there...wow. so much to do, so even though it costs more...you save on not havong to spend on tours. The inner lagoon has so many species of fish that come in from the ocean...you dont need to go on a snorkeling tour..Over all the hotel awesome to snorkel, good food and options, nice rooms and just plenty to see and do. Worth staying a few nights for sure!!!! ", " Must love birds!!! Traveled with an 8 yr old. Something for everyone. A bit pricey but expected. Suites are large and very comfortable. Ocean tower room 6097 great view of mountains and ocean lots of walking so bring comfy shoes. Get the aloha pass good value for drinks and breakfast buffet. Fantasic art work property will feel huge day one but familiar as you get settled in. Will definitely come back next year ", " Wonderful time watching the sun go down each evening, swimming with turtles in the lagoon and my wife swimming with the dolphins. This is a beautiful facility with pools, palm trees and boat an train travel to our rooms. We hardly needed our rental car. Quite expensive, of course, but worth it in our opinion. The food also is pricey so we perked coffee in our room and walked to local shops. On balance it has been a great relaxing two weeks that we can highly recommend. ", " We decided to stay here for a number of reasons, mostly because it is a Hilton and we were not let down in our expectations. From the lovely landscaping, the great amenities (the pools and the salt water lagoon were fantastic). We stayed in the Lagoon tower, and had a fantastic Ocean View. The room was very nice, lots of room, and a nice balcony with chairs. Be warned, there are about 100 or so birds that nest at night in one of the trees in the courtyard - they can be quite noisy, but only for about 15 minutes at sunset, and 15 minutes early (before 5am) in the morning.The pools were warm enough to pleasantly swim in (we are from Pensacola and are used to warm water), and the salt water lagoon was amazing with a huge variety of tropical fish and large turtles swimming with you. The staff was very friendly, and there were a few no brainers when it came to costs - definitely worth the extra $5 a day for the valet service as it can be a good walk to the parking lots, and definitely worth the 30 minute drive to Walmart to stock up on sodas/drinks/snacks. While you do have to walk a bit to get around, many people really enjoy strolling through the beautiful grounds, and enjoying the artwork, and excellent landscaping. The food was very good, but also quite pricey, which is to be expected all things considered. There are a number of very good and much less expensive restaurants within a 20 min drive. To be noted: HHonors members get $10 coupons (my wife and I got 2 of these for each day we stayed), these coupons can be used at a number of eateries throughout the resort.All in all, many of the things I have seen others complain about, such as the walking around a lot and the birds, we rather enjoyed - it is wild to watch 100 birds land in a small tree over a short period of time. The number of activities at the resort and on the island are plenty enough to keep you busy having fun. ", " The resort has everything you need for a relaxing vacation. The pool by Lagoon Tower has several kids activities throughout the day. The resort lagoon is awesome. You can snorkel, seeing a abundant of sea life. The resort luau is nice. Plan on using the tram or boats to get around, unless you like to walk! We traveled around the island by car, except for the northern most tip. The helicopter tours or the day excursion to Pearl Harbor are the best things off the resort. Beaches nearby are nice, but small. Don't try to see the Green Sand beach unless you have a 4-wheel drive. The breakfast buffet is awesome, just make sure you arrive early to save you some money. The Italian restaurant at the resort has excellent pizza. ", " All was well with our visit except the boat landing restaurant at night, terrible service. Do not eat there. It was taking 20 minutes to bus a table and several families were waiting to be seated, some had just checked in. There were several angry guests. Also the food took 40 minutes to be served after ordering, and in random order. The server was a young boy who did not apologize for the delay as he appeared to be very new. The manager was a goofball but was not managing the kitchen. ", " We spent 5 nights at this lush, tropical resort and loved every minute of it!!!! Our room in the Lagoon Tower overlooked the ocean sunset to our left and the Dolphin lagoon to our right. Accommodations clean and comfortable. Food on property is expensive, but we expected that for a resort and for Hawaii.There were a lot of families vacationing and there seemed to be plenty of activities for all age groups. We went off property to purchase water and sodas for our room fridge, would have liked to have a microwave to re-heat food. Lots of large portions were more than I could eat, but no way to keep them for later.I highly recommend this resort - we had lots of great info from the staff on everything from which was best beach to just discussing differences from our home in southeast part of the country vs the coast of the Big Island. Very friendly, no aggressive sales from anyone. They provide info on things to do, and you contact them if you want to set up a scheduled excursion.Lots of walking if you are not willing to wait for the tram or boat, but we enjoyed strolling the gardens and checking out the property. Loved this first Hawaiian experience and can't wait to go back!!!KimS. TN ", " Large and we'll equipped apartments with very large balconies. Limited views, but pleasant grounds.Not much to do in the area, but lots to visit with a car in 1-2 hours drive.Very good tennis courts. ", " The people that work here are top notch. They made our vacation one of the most memorable of all to Hawaii. Try being nice to the workers and they will go out of their way to see that you have a great time. Of course it's expensive. If you can't afford it, don't complain about it, just go somewhere else. This is paradise! The people, ocean, volcanoes, waterfalls, weather, palm trees...... ", " We have stayed here twice, the first time was 2007. Both times family was with us and we took two rooms. We had a few days to kill before moving into our condo in Keauhou. It is a great resort to have fun at, especially for families with kids. Almost like a Disney project. The rooms were nice, not really upscale but clean and large, pretty much typical of a good Hilton Hotel. We never did eat dinner at any of the many eateries in the complex but ate lunch there, which was okay. The Kona Coast has a lot of good places to eat, if one has a vehicle in which to get around a little.The big attraction of the place is its size and amenities. Very large swimming pools which are stretched out for great distances, with water slides, waterfalls, hot tubs, etc, everywhere. There is an excellent tram with very large picture windows that runs throughout the complex and starting at 2:00 PM little tour boats also run in canals which do the same as the tram, except on water. It is quite and extravaganza with, turtles, sea world dolphins and dolphin shows, parrots, fountains, artwork, statues, exotic and tropical fish, you name it. It some places you are reminded of what it must have been like in a palace setting in ancient China or Asia Minor.Well worth it. As a matter of fact, my wife's older sister was here for a week so we took her up there and just for the parking fee we were able to travel around for a few hours on the tram and take in the sights. She loved it. ", " I'm not normally a mega resort kinda person but had some Hilton points to use and we have family to visit so we took the plunge, 2nd time in 3 yrs. And i have to admit it was a grt stay. tvld w family(wife and 7 yr old boy) TipsIf u can, use point combo. U avoid the 25dlr resort fee and get free Internet and unlimited dvd rentals. We used 125 plus 25k pnts. Hilton has a great program but the rooms use up a lot of pointsHere using points only is 50k a night. Not a problem if ur an elite member but I was only gold. Resort broken up in a few areas which makes it more intimate. Beautiful place to wlk through day or night. Preference is ocean tower as its quieter has a coffee shop and a nice pool. Slides are good in the ot pool. The other is bigger but noisier and the water r colder. Comfy rooms and great bedsBkfst options limited but there is this cereal bar by dolphins that's reasonable. Egg sandwich fresh coffee and various cereals all under 5 dlrs. Buffet is typical overpriced but did I mention they give you 40 dlr credits as part of point prgrm so we used that to split a made to order omlet and kids buffet. Cme out to 10 each. Made to order om includes coffee a 7 dlr savings. Turtles come up to bask in sun which is coolOvr by ocean twrs. Svc and friendliness great. Everyone very much welcoming in a sincere wayRestaurants pretty ok but you don't come to the big Island for the food. Not sure why but it's overall mediocre, and usually pricey. . Pizza place has a pizza happy hr which will save money. Sushi place good as well. Most pricey as you would expect but you can make it reasonable by ordering smart, ie, share or appetizers only. Drinks pricey as you would expect so it's always good to grab some local Hawaiian brews for in rm fridge. A big plus for me is they have in room coffee. Rare for non business resorts and a great detail. There are some outstanding things to do on the island but I'll save that for another review.  ", " Just spent our second family vacation at this amazing resort. It has everything you can ask for. We swam with sea turtles everyday. Our room was clean and well cared for. There are plenty of dining options and the staff is friendly I wish the gym/workout area was bigger, it was crowded. Will go back again and again. ", " One of our most relaxing holidays ever.Our 7 year old boy enjoyed swimming with the turtles and the dolphine (even if the lst experience was expensive to pappas valet)Good hotel on a very interesting Island.Will come backOnly partly negative point was the \"air\"quality on the 1 floor in Ocean Tower. Smelled wet .. ", " if you are looking for that once in a life time stay in hawaii this is the place to go. this is a high end place but but well worth it. you have a monorail, lagoon boat system, pools and great salt water area to swim, snorkel, paddle boat, swim golf course tennis courts and probably a couple more things i forgot. the grounds can not be described in words how great they are. the staff was very helpful when we had a question. as i said this is high end and you will see this in the food prices. this would not stop us from going back again. o i forgot about swimming with the dolphins. something we will never forget. thank you for giving us a super end to our vacation. ", " Yes, a bit over the top, a bit Disney, a bit artificial - but still, what a great location! The grounds are amazing,above all the beautiful lagoon.Wonderful sunsets,friendly staff.The rooms are large and comfortable,but run of the mill (at least in Palace Tower),bathrooms could use a fresh and modern look. It's a great place for couples and families!Negative: only rather pricey food options, annoying resort fee, expensive parking and due to the layout of the place, albeit beautiful,rather long walks everywhere.What's really annoying is the constant barrage of noise in the tram....Still, I highly recommend this hotel ", " This is a hotel to stay at and just relax. We had an ocean view room and could sit on our balcony and watch the hump back whales migrate. It was an incredible close up show. The hotel has a lagoon and large green turtles come in. Snorkeling in the lagoon is easy and fun and right at hotel. We enjoyed the nightly music in the bar and ate at all of the restaurants. We rented a car one day, National is on site at hotel. We wished we had just stayed at the hotel. Need a rest, stay here!One warning: Distances between lobby and guest rooms can be quite far. The is a tram and a boat to take you around. We enjoyed the walk, about fifteen minutes at fast pace from our room to lobby or breakfast. Others may not. Tram and boats may not be there when you want to leave. ", " We were at Hawaii for a conference and decided to spend 3 nights here and were glad we did! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were thoroughly refreshed. Although the price was twice the cost of the condo we could have stayed at, we were do glad we chose to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village.Our package included an upgrade, so we had a partial ocean view on the seventh floor of the Palace Tower. This was fine for us as we wanted a quiet, peaceful room. The room layout was exceptional and pleasant with a corner-oriented bed, nice-sized table and chairs, decent balcony, and a separate area for the walk-in closet, bathroom, sink, and refrigerator / coffee maker. The resort itself is absolutely wonderful! with pools walking areas, a waterfall, ocean views, and works of art throughout.One tip: If you're there for a conference, walk through the trails to the conference center instead of the hallway connecting the buildings.Food tips: Stock up at Costco a few miles south of the airport. There's also a market in Waikoloa Village. ", " We love this resort. Some may say it is manufactured and not the \"real\" Hawaii, but it is paradise! The food is pricey, not going to gloss over it. Great service, wonderful food. We chose to buy cereal and milk at a supermarket for breakfast, as the buffet is TOO much if not included, which was great. Pools are amazing, beach service is great. Lagoon was so much fun! Annie, who hosted the hula, ukulele, and lei classes was wonderful. Oh and Dolphin Quest is an unforgettable experience! We took several trips out of the resort, always glad to return! Beautiful, from the museum walk to the ocean and grounds ... Awesome. ", " This was a fabulous vacation for all ages. Our 3 year old grandson cried when he had to leave- our adult children loved every minute and were constantly busy at lagoon and pools. This was our third trip to the Waikaloa and wont be our last!! Love everything about it! ", " I fell in love with this resort just going to visit it when we were driving along the island. We ended up canceling at the hotel we were at to stay there instead. People call it a disney resort and they are so right its hawaiian disney for adults beautiful fun and just plain awesome. If you dont like over the top resorts that have everything you could want to do there then its not for you. If your into beautiful resorts with gorgeous scenery activities restaurant then youll love it. One thing though foods expensive go down the street to the market instead. ", " Beautiful resort with lots of amenities that offer a big selection of activities. The staff was very helpful and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. The location of the resort offers excellent access to a wide sellection of shops,restaurants,the best beaches, fishing, whale watching, and helicopter tours and the Kona Airport. ", " This was the last hotel I stayed at until I went home. By far the shampoos were the greatest of any I've used in hotels! The breakfast buffets are great and snorkeling In the lagoon is great! Watching the Honu (Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles) and the tiny fish is a experience you'll never forget! As the last days of my time there, the best ever! I intend to move to Oahu' where there aren't many centipedes I hope and eventually I'll move to the Big Island where there aren't that many centipedes I hope. Aloha Oe! ", " Visited in March 2013 - Amazing place - would go back for another visitThe resort is enormous - there is a boat and a mono-rail to get you around (free of charge - hop on and hop off where you want)Pros: beautiful grounds, spacious and luxurious rooms, comfortable beds and nice linens, very clean, great pools and slides, whale watching from the shore, nice coastal hiking trail, luau is nice but not jaw dropping, worth the upgrade to Premium Seating and open bar ($26 extra)Cons: Very expensive drinks at the Tiki bar by the pool, all activities are paid - and priceyParking $17 (self) plus $33 resort fee / dayAbsolutely wonderful stay - Highly recommend it. ", " My wife and I spent 3 nights here at the end our 25th anniversary trip to Maui and Kona.This resort is huge! and it was perfect. Very upscale but casual is also perfect. We arrived and I am a diamond member so I asked for an upgrade.. The gentleman at the front desk was very nice and said he would look. He said he upgraded us to a suite and wow did he!! It was bigger than our first apt or house! 5 balcony's and everyone one of them with a great view. Ocean, golf course everything.You need to use the tram or boats because its a huge place. Walking around is a great workout! If your on a budget I would look at eating out or eat down in Kona at some local restaurants or fast food chains. The food is great but very expensive at the resort. The breakfast buffet is amazing and huge but its $30 a person. Dinner was that or more except at the mexican restaurant. This resort is for couples or families. The kids will love the Dolphin experience. We sat at the sports bar lounge outside one day for lunch and watched the Dolphin and trainers work with a group of kids. You can sit right on top of the water and see the show. amazing!!!!This resort also have fantastic shopping inside the resort of you can drive 1 minute and there is fantastic shopping right there. I would use the valet for parking its only 3 dollars more a night and they are very prompt and its alot easier to haul your luggage and daily bags. We didn't stay at the resort alot because we wanted to explore the island and hike the lava fields. This location was perfect for that. We spent alot of time at the Kona Village. Amazing atmosphere, shopping, and food. The only problem I had in Kona was I got the Ironman Triathlon bug again being right there at the start finish area. So, 2 weeks after returning home, I hired a trainer, bought a triathlon bike and I am now killing myself trying to qualify to return to Kona for the World Championships!! Wish me luck, those guys my age are very fast!!!! We also drove around the entire island one day and Hilo is a must see too. We will return and spend some time there next trip. But, it has a very British feel to it. Amazing island .Good luck and enjoy!! ", " We found the resort enchanting. If you are a light sleeper, the birds will keep you awake at night. It didn't bother us or the kids in the Lagoon Tower. This Tower was an ideal place for families. If it were just a couples trip, we may have stayed in the Palace Tower for a calmer experience. As with all vacations, everything is expensive. If the Aloha Passport is offered-- take it! The activities-- paddle boats, canoes, boards, putt putt, etc. all cost an additional fee. The Aloha Passport more than pays for itself very quickly. The large breakfast buffet is great-- we always ate a \"brunch\" there at about 10:00am to save on the cost of breakfast/lunch. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The Luau entertainment was excellent, but the food was only okay. All of the other restaurants in the resort were excellent! ", " This beautiful property is expansive. There are 1200 rooms all around a monorail and facing the beach. The open air space around the hotel sings with birds. The rooms are very comfortable and each has its own porch. We really enjoyed sitting out on the deck when we were not walking the property or swimming. The natural salt water lagoon is fun for swimming and the choice of pools spreads over the grounds. There are slides and waterfalls at all of the pools. Be sure to stop down to see the dolphins swim and play in their habitat. Make your reservation early if you want to swim with the dolphins yourself. Do take advantage of happy hour prices even if you are sitting around the pool with waitress service. The restaurant choices are all pretty good. Enjoy! ", " Hilton Waikoloa was a perfect! Rooms were clean and quiet. The boat and monorail that could be ridden to your room or to other areas on the hotel grounds were fun and made getting around easy. There are so many things to do right on the property. Pools, golf, mini golf (we played glow golf at night), water sports and the snorkeling in the lagoon was amazing. The sea turtles were everywhere. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from and others within walking distance along with shopping. We had a car, so day trips to other beaches and to the volcano area in Hilo were easy and fun. A perfect trip and a beautiful hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel!! ", " Five wonderful nights at the Hilton Wailoloa Village on the Big Island Hawaii. Was there for a conference (honestly). Perfect location overlooking the ocean. No direct ocean sandy beach, but same for many hotels on island. A nice beach off the lagoon though, along with a great pool.A very large resort with several restaurants, and even a Disney style train that runs from the lobby to the two separate hotel towers and conference center.Good for vacation too, with a private lagoon for snorkeling and on-site dolphin cove.Sorry to leave this beautiful resort and island. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Hotel this past summer. My son had been begging for years to go to Hawaii, since many of his friends had been. This property has something for everyone! Starting with the Ocean Tower - where we stayed. The view was gorgeous and serene. The best part of the stay was booking a \"swim with the dolphins\" experience on the property. It was a once in a lifetime experience, totally fun and we have the DVD to remember the experience by. My husband, son and I also really enjoyed the lagoon! We would snorkel with goggles on and watch the different colored fish and the large sea turtles that would regularly swim by in the water. There are restaurants on property, many shoppes, and swimming pools of every size and shape with water slides, etc. We enjoyed the gondolas for a leisurely ride around the property. The tram is equally unique, however, very slow. You can generally get where you need to be faster by walking then the tram will take you. Walking is so much fun on the property if you follow the pathways you will see gorgeous exquisite artwork from all of the world. I loved waking up to the sound of the birds chirping and even taped it in the morning on the last day before we left. On a stressful day at home, I will take out my cell and re-play the video of the sun rising and the birds chirping and it will instantly relax me and take me back to Hawaii!! ", " There is so much to do in this resort...It is great for couples and families. The grounds are beautiful and there are walking trails and so many pools and a lagoon great for snorkeling!It is so diverse in activities. There is a variety of shopping and dining within walking distance. It is a good location to explore the rest of the island from and a great place to return too. ", " Enjoyed a wonderful week stay at this resort. The weather was perfect, and the room was set up beautifully. We were getting ready to pack for our departure, when my husband suffered a medical emergency in our room. Hotel security arrived several minutes after I called them, both staff members were trained by The American Heart Association, and took over the sitution. While one staff member looked after my husband, the other staff member started to aquire the needed information from me. While we waited for the rescue crew, both security officers kept control of the emergency. After my husband departed in the ambulance, for the hospital, one of the security officers stayed with me, while I collected my husbands wallet. I was then driven to my rental car, and given directions to the hospital. The hotel gave us a 7:00pm departure time, instead of the 12:00pm, normal time. When returning later that afternoon to the hotel, I was directed to the Guest Experience Manager Mr. Tomm, after introducing myself, he immediatly asked how my husband was, and he knew our room number. I explained that the doctor was requiring my husband to stay, for 48hrs, until he would be cleared to fly. I knew that the hotel was booked for the next week! Mr. Tomm immediately told me not to worry, that we were able to stay in our room until the new flight time. Wow!!! I didn't think that the Hilton could be nicer....well, I was wrong. Mr. Tomm then procceded to tell me, to just park our car out front and that the valet would park it for us....free, no charge. This way my husband did not have to walk as far, as the regular lot. Later that evening, a surprise gift of drinks and cheese, arrived at our room, a gift from the Executive Assistant Manager Mr. McFarland, and Ms Bourgeois the Food and Beverage Manager. You might be thinking, this is just their way to make sure a popular corporation, returns. Wrong! my husband and I were here on pleasure only. We were not part of any group, staying at the hotel. I had booked my dates on line, at the Hilton site. This emergency was due to no fault of the Hilton, they were under no obligation to help us with this problem. Yes, this is a large resort, but this emergency taught me, that we were more than just a paying guest. We were truly treated like a friend in need. What could have been a very difficult 2 days, was made easier, by the caring staff of the Hilton Waikola. ", " This property is beautiful and stunning in every way! My husband is a diamond member and they upgraded us to the lagoon tower dolphin view! It was amazing! The rooms are recently renovated and closer to the front of the hotel, unlike ocean tower. The lagoon is really a nice beach area that is calm. The regular beaches in the afternoon were really really windy/ dangerous surf so this lagoon is a great alternative! Also we brought our own snorkeling gear and the lagoon has sea turtles and lots of different types of fish. This resort is very kid friendly but we don't have kids and still could find privacy. Only negative is that there were birds migrating or something and they are very loud at night. We slept with earplugs. Also since we were diamond members we got to rent unlimited movies for free! We can't wait for our next stay!!!! ", " Overall we had an excellent experience experience. My wife and I stayed for one week with our 2 year old son and an infant daughter. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and had a partial ocean view room. The bird-noise that some previous guests mentioned can be heard, but it didn't bother us at all. After a while we consider that was part of the natural enviroment around us and thought it was beautiful. We enjoy the walk around the resort and consider that to be very healthy. We used the canoe and the train as our toddler really enjoy that. The sand pool and lagoon were safe for the children to play in. We had breakfast at the Big Island Breakfast everyday. The breakfast also has some Asian food selection, wonderful fresh papaya, tropical fruit drink, and great muffins. The servers there all seem gracious, hardworking, and friendly. Yet we noted that they didn't get tips much!!! We enjoy the artworks around the resort, some are museum quality (think of San Francisco Asian Art Museum) and added a wholistic ambien around the resort. Overall, hotel staffs are all willing to help and display great aloha spirit. For families with stroller, there are actually different alternate stroller friendly route to go close to the beach, we just have to explore.We did drive to Akaka Falls, took scenic drive to Hilo, and visit Hapuna Beach North of the Hilton Village. Hapuna Beach is a white sand beach and is only 6 miles away.A few things that Hilton may want to consider: 1) Designated smoking area throughout the resort as we noted people smoke randomly outside on the walkways; 2)Wheelchair accessible ramp for the train; 3) Complementary 2 water bottles in the room like most hotels in the mainland, 4) Install \"Do not disturb\" signs on door knobs. ", " This resort is on the Kona side of the big island and is next to all of the other resorts. The resort is super cool with the tram running through the resort to shuttle you to your room or meeting areas. Our room was well appointed and we felt like it was in a good area of the resort. They have a private beach area and the grounds are very pretty. However, once outside of the resort you are literally in the middle of nowhere. You have to drive miles back into the town of Kona and their are no other shops or facilities outside of the resort. It was very isolated. We enjoyed our time on this island visiting Volcanoes National Park, but I think on our next go around we will stay on the Hilo side where it is more tropical. ", " We stayed at the Hilton for 9 days and it blew for 8 days! Even the locals said it was more than their normal wind. The resort is huge but has a train and boat for people to get around. We are walkers so we loved the amount of walking we did. The dolphins were such a bonus and we snorkeled in the lagoon every day getting spoiled by the number of beautiful fish and turtles. Many people enjoyed kayaking and stand up paddling. Many restaurants to choose from and you could find a different pool every day! We had breakfast included with our room and it was the best buffet with the most selection I have ever see. So if you like huge property, dolphins, turtles, tropical fish, pools, knock out breakfast then go to the Hilton! By the way the restaurants range from very casual to very nice. We loved our stay there! ", " I stayed here with my family over the holidays in one of the huge suites in Palace Tower with a full lanai, sauna in my bathroom and even a baby grand piano (that I enjoyed brushing up on my piano playing skills). First, I will say that I never have a bad experience when traveling to Hawaii, and Hilton hotels always make my stay feel grand. This was definitely the most GRAND suite I have ever stayed in, it probably even topped or tied with Maui's Ho'olei at Grand Wailea villa (even though it was newer). I loved everything about the suite - it was huge, had everything. My only complaint was that they should really update the kitchen - everything else was beautiful, but the kitchen was very outdated and an eyesore. Also unless you always waited for the train, walking around can be a pain, but just have patience and wait. Another thing I will say is that the pools were very cold which was a downside, I would have spent a lot more time in them had they been warmer. I did travel during December but I have traveled to other places at this time and pools were kept at a warmer temperature. But I loved everything else about staying in my room, the location and sights (views were amazing), the people were very nice, and nice food options. My favorite food choice would be going to Queen's Market and going to Lemongrass Express - amazing food and chef! There are so many things to do on the big Island, so get out and explore. It is a nice little drive to go anywhere, at least 20-30 minutes before you get to anything like the city of Kona, but the scenery while driving along the road is relaxing. I would love to come back! ", " We stayed a the Hilton Waikoloa Village the first week of February. It was the first time we have watched the Super Bowl when it was still daylight out ! The resort is amazing and breathtakingly beautiful. They spared no expense when they built this place to include the tram, boats, dolphin experience, and all of the asian art work. There is a large variety of restaurants, but we did not get a chance to try all of them. The Kamuela Provision Company was outstanding, but the Kirin Chinese restaurant and the Boat Landing Cantina were only average. We had group dinners the rest of the time, which were all very good, so we did not get a chance to try any other restaurants on the property. I wish we could have tried Imari Japanese restaurant, but we ran out of time. The guest rooms are nice and have plenty of space. One amazing feature is that you can watch whales this time of year from the shore and from your guest room if you are facing the ocean. There were also sea turtles and a lot of fish you can see while snorkeling in the lagoon. I would definitely come back to this property again. It would be a great place to bring the kids next time with a lot of things for them to do at the pools, lagoon, or the dolphin experience. There is a rental car agency on the property so you can rent cars to take day trips around the island. This resort was a very nice, peaceful experience, and it did not get loud or rowdy with parties late at night. It was a very relaxing place to experience the beauty of Hawaii !! ", " family friendly glbt friendly, nice staff helpful and work with your needs even after check out, hold your stuff while you relax at the spa or anything till you need to go to the airport. awesome place to go! ", " I love the Hiltons and this property is beyond belief! The property is huge, but extemely easy to get around (monorail, boats or walking) and absolutely breath taking!We chose an Ocean View and were placed in the Ocean Tower. As we are Hilton Honor members we were upgraded to an Ocean Front view. The lanai overlooked the golf course and the ocean at Buddha Point. The room was gorgeous and very spacious. Staff was excellent...the valets, the check in clerks, the baggage staff....all perfection. Although slightly higher than other properties on the Big Island...well worth every penny.I walked the entire property on the second day and enjoyed the scenery, the ocean and the gorgeous art work through out the property. This property is compared by some reviewers as too much like WDW (a place I adore and stay at frequently), but this just made the Big Island stay more relaxing.I loved this hotel and enjoyed every moment we stayed there. Well worth the time and money. ", " This was a great hotel .The rooms were nice and big.The grounds were awesome.We only stayed 2 days but would stay here if we ever come back to the Big Island.Enjoy your stat as we did.Hawaii is awesome. ", " This is the second visit to this hotel. We had considered others, but wanted to enjoy the beauty and serenity that this hotel offers. Unfortunately, the trade winds were blowing so swimming in the pools was rather challenging.... had to make sure the towels didn't blow away! The water wasn't as warm as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed relaxing on the lounge chairs and managed to get a sun burn even with sunscreen ( guess I didn't reapply as much as I should have.) On a previous visit, we had found the Lagoon Tower area to be too noisy with all the birds and so we wanted to stay in the Palace Tower again. However, management must have responded to their customers because many of the tall palms had been cut back and there wasn't any more noise that might have disturbed a person's rest. The nearby Queen's Marketplace does have a small market so that you could stock up on drinks, etc. This time, we also stopped in at the Waikoloa Village which is about 6 miles away and found a great grocery store to pick up food so that we did not have to go to the resort's restaurants as often. The hotel room did have a small fridge so we were able to get small containers of salads, yogurt, etc..... great if your budget is tight!A great hotel, and if I were ever to go back to the Big Island, I am sure I would want to return to this hotel. ", " First class resort right on the ocean. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Food was expensive and service was rushed at some of the restaurants in the resort. The grounds and facilities were outstanding. We will definitely return to this Hilton resort in the future. ", " Sunsets to watch. Just spectactular! Take a great camera and relax on a sun chair and keep shooting! Truly a wonderful background for all memorable pictures and the best scenery pictures! Boat and train rides are fun for families. Lots of pools to swim in with and without children. Beautiful flowers and birds to watch. ", " We just got back from 3 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Several things worth considering:(1) The resort is incredible looking - there are beautiful plantings, fantastic asian art pieces everywhere, and remarkable water work with a boat that can take you from place to place around the hotel. (2) There's a tram (train) that is loads of fun for the kids. it helps to get you around this enormous resort.(3) There's a dolphin experience - but you don't need to go through a fence to see them. There's a nice simple breakfast place (one of only two reasonably priced things on the resort) near where the dolphins live and you can sit and watch them from just a few feet away. Lots of fun.(4) There's a protected lagoon with beach that has wonderful snorkeling. We saw seven sea turtles at once frolicking at the bottom of a waterfall one time. The lagoon is open to the ocean and the fish can come and go - there are lots of different things to see.(5) Almost every room has a great view of the ocean. You can sometimes even see whales off the shoreline.(6) There are great pools everywhere. The pools near the ocean tower have three waterslides - two of which are great for small kids and one is great for somewhat older kids. (7) Breakfast at the \"Lagoon Spoon\" consisted of bagels, cereal, or egg and cheese on a roll. These are very fairly priced.(8) You can buy snorkel equipment there at reasonable prices. Not much more than on Amazon amazingly. Hawaii in general was odd in that some things are very expensive but snorkeling and pool gear were very fair. You'll do better at a local supermarket or in another part of the island, but these prices at the resort were ok.(9) They have a luau at the resort - very expensive overall ($109/adult) but it was a good show and a pretty good dinner. Think of it as a night on broadway and you'll enjoy. Worthwhile show.(10) Many of the employees of the hotel seemed to not know very much. Concierge's and front desk people seemed clueless about the island (and even the resort sometimes).(11) The rooms were large - typical Hilton style. Would have liked a light to read by on the balcony.(12) Food prices were expensive - consider eating off the resort.(13) They charge $17/night for rental car parking in a big lot that is still too full fairly far from the front door. Truly, you'll need to plan for 30 minutes travel from your room to your car if you are going out.(14) They get you with a \"resort fee\" of about $25-30/night/room.(15) After these fees they charge you to use snorkels, paddle boards, etc. I think these things ranged from $30-50/hour. Seemed alot. Nobody was using them.(16) They charged $10/person for hula lessons, ukulele lessons, or other simple activities that are usually included at other resorts (they were free at the Westin Moana Surfrider in Waikiki).(17) You have to pay to have a flower lei when you arrive at the resort. And, they had to be ordered in advance. That's a big part of the hawaii experience, especially for kids - this could have been included.(18) A pet peeve for me - we are a family of four, but on arrival and each day they would put towels for two.(19) Waikoloa is far from most other interesting things on the island. Hilo town (with the better helicopter rides) and the waterfalls are a two hour drive from the resort. (If driving - go to the Hawaiian Style Cafe in Waimea for breakfast - unbelievable!). The Volcano national park is a three hour drive. Black sand beaches are 2 1/2 hours away. So, figure 6-7 hours of driving alone if you want to go see the volcano park (a can't miss experience). But, it's still worthwhile to stay at the resort for the day or two of relaxing you get on an active vacation and the weather in this area can be 20-30 degrees higher than in the Hilo area. When we were there Hilo was 58 degrees with pouring rain and high winds while the Waikoloa area had 79 degrees with sun and clear skies.So, in summary, this is a resort that will amaze the kids and give you a little bit of Disney World on the Big Island. They'll try to nickel and dime you for everything, but there are some great aspects to the resort. ", " The only words I can say are \"absolutely stunning.\" yes, there are things that aren't perfect. I could complain about the fact that you can't buy a cup of coffee anywhere for under $4.50, or that the valet took almost a half hour on one particular night, but overall my family absolutely loved the waikoloa Hilton. The grounds are incredibly beautiful. There were whales jumping just offshore in the later afternoon. Over a dozen sea turtles were sunning themselves on the rocks. The pools arelarge and spread out enough. My kids liked all the different size slides. Prior complaints about the pools being cold are definitely true. I thought the pools were freezing, but my kids didn't care! My absolute favorite thing about this place was the lagoon. We taught our kids to snorkel in a safe, comfortable environment that still had lots of pretty fish and turtles. Considering how windy it was, this was our only way to teach them snorkeling. they now are hooked. It was so much fun! Just up the road are very nice queens and kings marketplace shops and restaurants. The breakfast buffet which was included in our plan, was great. I don't know how much it costs otherwise, but at least it was very good. We were in Palace tower,and still had a decent piece of ocean to view from our balcony. The stars at night are amazing fromthe balconies. The rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. I don't like the resort fees, but that seems to be almost everywhere. As far as the size, well the place is huge. There are shortcuts to take throughoutt he property though, and a little walking was nice anyway. The tram, and boats, well we found them to be a lot of fun. since each stop says how long til the next tram or boat, you can then decide whether to walk or not. The kids club at night gave the wife and I a couple of nice romantic dinners without the kids, and wasn't overpriced (it costs $105 total for both kids and includes their dinner, and for that the kids are in camp from 4:30 until 9:30.) the kids didn't want to leave at the end of the night. Best meal we had was nearby at Roy's. Lastly, I truly appreciated that the general manager sent me an email middle of my stay asking if anything was amiss and asking if he could help in any way. Nice touch. This was paradise, and I highly recommend it as a base for visiting the Big Island.Larry ", " Being in Hawaii is a pleasure itself and then you find yourself in the Hilton Waikoloa village. There are pools, swimming with dolphins, board paddling on a lagoon, golfing and I can go on and on! All the employees are friendly and helpful! Looking forward to another visit soon. ", " This hotel truly was heaven on earth. Seriously amazing views, lush scenery, restaurants galore onsite, and to top it all off, a monorail or a Disneyesque boat to take you to your room. We stayed for 10 days and it was the single best hotel I have been to in the world. I have traveled extensively in Europe and Asia and this hotel tops them all. It took my wife and I 2 days to find the large pool...I had to use my iPhone Google Earth app to direct me to it!The staff was amazing, the hotel pristine and again, the views, property and the in house boat made it a vacation that can not be topped, that is until our next visit.The hotel is also situated on the west side of Waikoloa Village, and very very close to shopping and groceries and restaurants, which is a wonderful option.I can probably write a book about this hotel, but will refrain for now. If you have a choice of hotels on the Big Island, and wish to please your children or the child in all of us, book a stay here...PS, the dolphins are right by the restaurants, not hidden away like they are at the Atlantis in the Bahamas, so everyone can enjoy them...Did I say amazing? ", " Just got back from Hawaii and stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island. WOW WOW and WOW some more! This hotel was just fabulous and I can't wait to get back there. From the moment we arrived, it was first class service all the way. They don't miss a beat at this hotel. They've got the waterfalls, the lush landscaping, the scattered pools and hot tubs, the grotto, the dolphin watch, the exotic birds, the poi fish, the lagoon, the tram and boats that take you from tower to tower, the friendly staff, the free lei making class (and other free classes as well), fabulous shopping throughout the hotel, dining for every budget and did I leave anything out? Cause if I did, they sure didn't with the attention to detail they put into this hotel. Oh yeah, I forgot about the fabulous artwork, sculptures and paintings that connect the towers...Just gorgeous! And dining at KPC restaurant for my birthday was an experience I will always remember....outdoors on the rock patio, tiki torches, the sand, the water waves splashing in the background...and did I mention the food? OMG...Fantastic! I could go on and on about this hotel but you have to see it for yourself. I highly recommend it! ", " I knew the hotel would be upmarket, but honestly it was quite amazing. Dolphins, flamingos, pools (both fresh and salt water), art, a monorail, and boats. This place is like a hotel crossed with Disneyland. I attended a conference at the hotel and would have loved more time to experience all it had to offer. The room was fantastic. Nice and clean with a balcony. One gripe was that wifi was extra if you wanted it in the room (they offered it as part of a $25 per day package). We did not pay this. However, we were able to log in at a a number of locations in the hotel, including the lobby. The food at the resort was expensive compared to American food in general (I'm from New Zealand), but we went down to the Kings and the Queen's shopping centres that are a short walk away to buy food we could eat during the day. There are also eateries there.A real highlight was the salt water lagoon fed from the ocean. In the pool were tropical fish and giant sea turtles that would come in freely from the sea. The grounds abounded with palm trees and tropical plants. There were a number of interesting birds around, including a black swan. The decorating was mainly an Asian theme, with multiple koi ponds. The grounds were immaculate. I thoroughly enjoyed staying here. I would recommend it particularly for families. I imagine kids would be amazed by this place. I'd love to stay here again but don't think I could afford the un-conference-discounted rooms. ", " The evening we were there (in February) the whales were delightfully entertaining, the food good and the sunset magnificent. Don't miss this place for dinner. Have the coconut creme brulee for dessert. Yum! ", " They have a natural \"pool\" that is actually a small lagoon that allows the sea life to come and go at will. We watched turtles and fish, and could easily snorkel around in the safety of the pool and even enjoy the waterfall they added. There's also a family of dolphins that lives there, and they have access to the fresh sea water as well and the tides go in and out and determine their enclosure depth. There's great gardens to walk around in and the koi in the pond are beautiful. There's some NeNe to see along with Flamingos and Crowned Cranes, and other birds. Whales can be seen spouting and breaching out just off the beaches and rocks. They provide nice places to sit and watch the sunset and there's plenty of real pools for the adults and kids alike. We'd definitely go back to stay there again. It's close to the Kona airport, and there's plenty to do on day trips. ", " We had a great time! Looking forward to another trip in our future. The facility was clean, well kept and always being groomed. The staff was courteous and upbeat. We felt like we were royalty. They treated us with the greatest respect. ", " This is an exceptionally beautiful property with everything: weather, pool, beach, snorkeling, whales, dolphinarium, garden, art, restaurants, sunsets, etc. very expensive parking which is annoying. Try to get it waived. Other than that, paradise ", " We stayed at this resort the week before Christmas and had a wonderful time. I read all the reviews on this site before hand and I have to say that some people just like to complain. Yes, you have to walk alot, but it's Hawaii and 80 degrees out. Get the exercise and enjoy the warm weather. The pools are cold, but again, my kids could of cared less... We're in Hawaii!! Food was slightly expensive, but you have to expect it. It was all very delicious so we enjoyed it. We had a pedicure at the spa, this was the best pedicure I've had so... well worth the money and experience. We stayed in the Ocean Towers and the rooms were huge, clean and quiet. Loved the flowers on the pillows that we found after housekeeping cleaned. Try a snorkel cruise out of Kona, what a nice day trip. Go for breakfast at Dave's Plate and Coffee Shack. Yummy!!! This was just an amazing trip and miss it every day since we've been back. Thank you Hilton Waikoloa Village for everything! ", " We had the opportunity to visit Waikoloa Village Resort February 2013. It was our first time to Hawaii and we were not disappointed. If there is a down side it is the long flight, but once you arrive at the Hilton Waikoloa your troubles are behind you. We were there on a business excursion that we extended into a vacation. We spent a week there. The food was excellent although choices were limited. The accommodations were great. Very nice rooms, ours face the ocean, with all the trimmings. We spent our time watching whales just off shore, walking the grounds, and enjoying the atmosphere and gorgeous weather. The were opportunities to swim with Dolphins, snorkel, and many other water sports. We did Golf while there the Oceans course. Very challenging. If you are looking for long sandy beaches and swimming in the ocean, this not the place to go. If you are looking to relax and enjoy the amenities the resort has to offer it is excellent. ", " It doesn't get much better than any of the towers around the natural lagoon the hotel is nestled around. An excellent conference venue, lots of room around all the pools, beach front, dolphin pools (where you can swim with them),and the lagoon full of turtles, yellow and prison tang fish, and is very kid-friendly. Good for all ages. Food is decent, of moderate value for the price. Could use more veggie items, but the seafood is pretty great (especially the ahi poke). Shops nearby (about 1km, 15-20min walk or a $2 shuttle) have food, beer/wine, clothes, dinner options, etc. Amazing sunsets. ", " This property has the Wow factor in all areas! Amazing staff, wonderful rooms and magnificent landscaping. We spent 2 nights here but will definitely stay here on our next trip to the Big Island. The pool was a favourite area for the entire family. Watched sea turtles in the bay. The grandchildren snorkeled in the beach area. The restaurants were great, the wait staff friendly and very attentive. We used Hilton points with no problem, and would recommend this property to all friends and family without hesitation. ", " I have stayed at this hotel several times, and wouldn't hesitate to return. The property is huge -- you can get around by boat or tram, or you can walk; the walk takes you by amazing museum quality displays, definitely worth doing at least a few times. The rooms are very nice, beds are comfortable, everything was clean and convenient; ocean view is great if you spend any time in your room. The elevators are very fast -- essentially no wait at all. The grounds are spectacular, and beautifully maintained. There are numerous pools, and some are set up like a lazy river, and which range in size from quite tiny to quite large. Many of the pools have waterfalls, the sound of which masks the sounds of any people. It is very easy to get off by yourself, and feel that you are virtually alone. Some people in our group complained about the great amount of walking that is required. If you stay in the ocean tower, many rooms are a considerable distance from the elevators so if you have trouble walking or if you are toting a large quantity of stuff every time you go to the pool, request a room closer to the elevators.My major complaint with this resort is the restaurants. You might expect high prices, but the quality is very poor compared to the cost. Our group ate at the Kamuela Provision Company, which Hilton refers to as a sophisticated restaurant. We were part of a group with a limited menu, but I (and others in my group) thought the food was poor quality, actually probably very poor quality. We ate at the Boat Landing Cantina which has a pseudo Mexican menu (tacos, chips, and salsa) that was also expensive, but most notably, had very poor service; there was considerable delay before being greeted, and the wait for food was 30 to 45 minutes. We ate at the Lagoon Grill; our hamburger ordered without cheese, came iwth cheese -- again just not what you expect from a top-notch resort. Our catered breakfast was just ordinary -- scrambled eggs. bacon, very ordinary pastries, and very disappointing fruit -- no papaya, no mango, fruits that we say in abundance at the farmer's market in Hilo. So, many people treked to the local Kings' and Queens' shopping areas with a few mostly chain restaurants and fast food with more poor quality food but at a lower price. Who creates a resort like this without a great ice cream stand -- all they had was soft serve!But, I'd still go back -- spectacular grounds, nice rooms, and the weather sure beats Wisconsin in January. ", " The resort was wonderful. The service was great, the grounds were beautiful, and the overall experience was very Hawaii. We stayed in the Lagoon tower which was just renovated so everything was fresh and new. The grounds are spread out but there is a tram and boat for shuttle service. ", " I visit this hotel every time I'm on The Big Island, which is every other year. I always alternate between the train and the boat to go around the hotel. Being part Japanese, I really enjoyed how they have introduced the Japanese area in the bottom lobby area. I always bring new people with me to visit the hotel, whether it be a friend, or my fiance, or my parents. Whoever is visiting with me I bring to the hotel and they enjoy it very much. I have not seen any hotel like this. The boat around the hotel is a very unique experience, but I would highly recommend trying the boat, train, and walking through the halls to see all the different displays to really appriciate what a marvel this hotel is. ", " I stayed at this hotel resort 2/2/13-2/6/13 - Fabulous. The resort is very big, with beautiful views overlooking the ocean, where the waves crash on the black lava. There are three towers, we stayed in the Palace tower with a garden view. Room (#3274) was spacious, 2 dbl beds, couch, chairs/table, flat screen tv, large dresser with a separate area to hang clothes & a safe. There was also a refrigerator & coffee maker. Room was very quiet, didn't hear any noise in the hallway at night. The only thing missing from this tower is a store in the lobby to buy things like soda, snacks, souvenirs, etc. You have to go to another tower. There is a tram or a boat that takes you to all the other towers as well as the conference center & lobby. There is a pool at each end of the resort (lagoon tower & ocean tower). In the middle is the lagoon with a beach for swimming (be aware there are fish & turtles swimming in the lagoon as well). Next to the lagoon is the lagoon grill which had excellent burgers. Breakfast buffet at Water's Edge was terrific, something for everyone. Food is not cheap but being from NY we could deal with it. In the lagoon area is Dolphin Quest, what an unbelievable experience (but not cheap). The sunset views are spectacular. We also enjoyed the luau. A resort I would definitely go back to. ", " Service-amazing! Hotel grounds- spectacular! We stayed at Ocean Tower. It is the furthest building away from the main lobby. There is a tram but takes just as long to walk. Birds in morning are loud but also nice to listen to. Food at restaurants in hotel is ok. Prices are high for the food. Would come back but will stay at lagoon tower. Again, very nice stay. ", " This is the 2nd time I've visited, this time with 2 kids aged 10mths & 3 yrs. We stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View in the Ocean Tower on the ground floor. It was great - we would walk out the patio on the grass and watch the sunset. There is so much here to do, you don't want to leave. Even the boat & airtrain within the resort was fun for the kids! The Italian Pizza restaurant was great, Chinese restaurant was great too. Yes it's a big resort - a lot of walking, but you feel fit and alive! It's great! Not the best for strollers as there are lots of steps and bridges. We took the 3 yr old for a Dolphin Encounter (must be pre-booked) which was a highlight and highly recommend! Our room was a bit dated and looking a bit tired. The corridor was ugly with very old carpet! Would certainly like more \"pool-side\" service as this would make it awesome! There was a huge group when we visited, and yes it seemed like a lot of people around - but it added to the vibe. Wasn't too busy. My 3 yr old loved the small pool sides near the Ocean Tower which was great, as it wasn't very busy and close to our room with a bar/snacks nearby. He was too young to go on the big slide at the other end of the resort, near the Dolphin Tower, so i'm glad we weren't staying down that end. The lagoon is great for all ages. We had breakfast at the Italian Restaurant which was lovely, but huge servings! Our friends tried the buffet breakfast which said it was terrible. We then went to the cereal bar near the dolphins which was cheap & simple. Will definitely return - just hope they have a refurb in the rooms soon. ", " As other reviews and said,this is a VERY large resort,but that means more things to do.Plenty of resturants and lounges, Many pools to pick from.The golf courses are good and very reasonable.We stayed in the ocean tower and the room was large and very comfortable.Prices are a little high at the resturants but you can take a shuttle to the Queens market for other choices.Overall excellent stay.Staff does a great job. ", " I stayed here for 7 days on my honeymoon and loved it! The pools are amazing, while swimming at the waterfall lots of turtles were swimming all around me. What an experience! The view from our room was excellent and i could not wait to open the curtains every morning to see the landscape and ocean. The resort is large but I like that. Getting on the boat to get to the main reception everyday was great fun. At night, we would take a walk to the Buddha and watch the sun go down... so relaxing. Staff were nice and helpful. When I plan to come back to Big Island...I will definitely think about staying here again. The only down side was the selection of food at night, I wish there was a bit more choice and may be some entertainment. ", " My wife and I stayed here for a few days and it was wonderful. No complaints out of us. Service was great and it was very relaxing. It wasn't packed and busy like the other island. We are going to recommend that anyone comes to Hawaii needs to stay here for a few days. ", " We stayed for a week on a supplier trip that took care of the food & drink bills. I cannot comment on the prices, but they seem to be in line with \"Hawaii\". We felt the resort was very large and laid out well. We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go without the tram or boat shuttle service. The resort was just too beautiful! Walking allowed us to actually see the entire beauty of the resort. Plenty of food choices were available, along with numerous types of drinks. Our room selection was in the \"newer\" building on the second floor overlooking the ocean and pool. The rooms on floor below us did not seem as desirable and we saw many couples move to a higher floor. You will want to be up off the main floor to enjoy the view. The birds did make a lot of noise, especially at sunrise and sunset. Earplugs fixed that problem. The restaurants were all very good, and reservations were somewhat difficult at peak times. The spa was nice, but a little overpriced. The pools and lagoon are one of the best features on the property. No problem with chairs, as their were plenty! We love to snorkel and the lagoon cannot be beat for anyone with kids! Plenty of fish and sea life to be seen in a safe environment. The only drawback was a lack of an ocean beach. We were able to walk on a trail 1/2 mile to a local beach with good snorkeling. They also provide a shuttle if you prefer for $2.  I would definitely recommend this resort to couples, as well as anyone with kids age 5-15, as the lagoon will keep them busy all day. ", " This was our second trip to our favorite resort in Hawaii. The renovated ocean view room in the lagoon tower was beautiful. The ocean views are fabulous. The smiling faces at the breakfast buffet, excellent bartenders and drinks at The Malolo Lounge, friendly waitresses and excellent food at the restaurants, a great selection for shopping in the area, an unbelievable spa and warm Hawaiian sunshine all contribute to a fantastic vacation.We want to return again! ", " While returning to Hawii to welcome new Grandsons arrival ,my sister who wisely booked this wonderful Hotel gave a lifetime of memories yo the our family. The other four children swam to thier hearts delight as thier Mom got some downtime in her Pre Labor Status. The food, staff, grounds and beautiful Art thtoughtout the Property was in itself worth the trip .I will very much look forward to returning to omeet my new grandson wh decided he would rather hand out in a pool of his own a little longer(moms )and arrive two days after we returned home to Montana. What a perfect excuse to hurry back. not like we needed one. My personal thank'sto my sister Mary who made this trip possible and the Aloha Spirit of our wobderful hosts And staff. ", " Just returned from a week at this resort and I was blown away with it's beauty. I have stayed at 2 other resorts in Hawaii over the years and this one beats them all. The grounds are just beautiful. It truly was breathtaking. It is true, that this resort is HUGE! Lots and lots of walking, but we didn't mind.Only took the boat/tram once. Found out that I can walk faster than that tram can move. Plus, we got to see all the oriental artwork along the way. It was like being in a museum with all the statues and things. The people that work there were very friendly. Food was really good. Ate at most of the restaurants at some time or other. Imari was really good if you like Japanese. The pools were gorgeous. But the water was waaaaay to cold to attempt to get in. So we just soaked in the sun and had our cocktails. **The lava flow is my favorite**, The rooms are just average. Nothing special. Very comfy beds but not much on decor. But who cares. You aren't in your room but to sleep. I was very sad to leave this place and would stay there again in a heartbeat. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!! ", " This is one of the best resorts in the world. Rooms are updated. This property offers lots of activities, lagoon offers snorkeling, or you can swim with dolphins, Lua dinners are fun, restaurants top of the line, tennis, gulf just few other activities. Sunset are fabulous. ", " Want to swim with the dolphins? Want to experience a great luau? How about just soaking up the sun and reading a book on a beautiful beach? Hilton Waikaloa is the premier location on the big island in my opinion. Sure Kaanapali is nice but it's prohibitively expensive. Waikaloa brings the Hilton touch to everything making it a 5 star vacation hotel. ", " Our stay at The Hilton at Waikoloa Village was outstanding. We loved our clean, spacious hotel room that offered lovely views of the ocean front and dolphin area. Our family enjoyed snorkeling in the lagoon area and swimming in the beautiful pools. There were many restaurant options at the resort that were all terrific, but our favorite was the waterfront restaurant KPC. We enjoyed the expansive grounds, numerous pools, spa and found them very well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, this was a top notch vacation!! ", " This place is so much fun and relaxing. I loved my Mani and Pedi. I love shopping here although it is a bit expensive. The food is alright, but not as good as the eateries in the King's shop and Queens's marketplace. ", " My husband and I just returned from 10 days at the Hilton Waikoloa. This is our 6+ stay at this property and will definately return as often as possible. Our jobs take us around the world and to all the hawaiian islands, staying at high end hotels....this one is by far the best we have found for beauty and customer service. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous and very well kept. It is a huge resort but we like that there is so much to see and we enjoy the walks from one area to another. We go there for vacation we so are not in a hurry. As diamond members we have stayed in all the towers. We prefer ocean front in Ocean Tower, the views are incredible, and it seems a bit quieter than Lagoon Tower which appears to have more families with children. I have read negative comments about the bird noise....you hear them in the evening and a little in the morning but this does not bother us at all, in fact we enjoy it as it is part of the beauty of where we are. As with any large hotel in Hawaii the prices are high...but that is expected. Don't go if you can't afford the splurge. The grocery store in Queen's Marketplace is actually very reasonable as an alternative for drinks and snacks, and the sushi from there is very fresh and good.Besides the beauty and serenity here, the customer service is always outstanding. Mr. Jim Russell, director of front office operations, is very professional, gracious and always there to help with anything. The staff in the restaurants and bars definately deserve recognition as well. They are there year after year, and they remember your names and what you do, where you are from, etc. In the Malolo Lounge, Bob and Napua are extraordinary!! At the Boat Landing Cantina, Eddie and Scottie, and in the Kohala Pool bar, Peter is the greatest!!! All in all....the customer service from everyone here is the best I've seen anywhere. That goes from the front desk, to the food and drink servers, to the housekeepers and behind the scenes lawn and service people. Every employee goes out of their way to greet you with an Aloha and a smile.We have found the food to be hit and miss. Very good appetisers in Malolo Lounge. The food at Kamuela Provision Company is fabulous and when you sit outside on the patio, it truly is an unforgettable evening!!George and Barbara S.The Woodlands, TX ", " ... you can opt to take trams and boats but the waits tended to be long. Otherwise, the place is a paradise ... beautiful views, nice pools, great swimming lagoon for snorkeling with the sea turtles, Asian artwork and statuary everywhere. Restaurants are very pricey but we traveled around and sampled other restaurants ... nothing is low but there are some cool spots to dine around there. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village from December 30th to January 8th. This was the second time we stayed at this hotel and can honestly say it will not be our last. We requested a room in the Palace Tower. This tower is the closest tower to the lagoon and is away from all the birds but does come with a 15 minute walk to your car (we timed it). The rooms are standard Hilton rooms, but are on the larger side. There were two of us but could see up to four people staying in the room. Breakfast was included in our package. We enjoyed the food but were disappointed when we found that they stopped making the fruit smoothies. They were a highlight the last time we stayed here. Most of our time was spent at the lagoon as it is MUCH warmer than the pool water. As I stated in my previous post of this hotel, you are required to do a lot of walking but that\u2019s what you get for staying on a 62 acre hotel. The Hilton Waikoloa Village really does offer just about everything you need. We didn\u2019t want to leave and were already talking about our next trip back. Overall, I would advise everyone to stay here at least once just to experience the hotel. ", " Everything was first class: service, facilities, and food. I was hesitant to stay at a large resort As quality across the board is hard to maintain. They do it here. FYI the rooms are newly redone and beautiful-much better than pictures on the website. ", " Wow ! After reading some of the reviews rated 3 or less stars , I must say people are extremely ignorant !!! Really ?? Room service for 2 bottles of water then you complain about the price !? Get over yourself Mr. Stuffed Shirt !! And complaining about the speed of the tram ?!? Who are you , royalty ? God !! Anyway , this is by far the most amazing hotel I've ever seen , and yes , I HAVE travelled extensively through Europe , and Southeast Asia so I'm not a hick from the backwoods ... That being said , went to the Legends of the Pacific luau in early Jan ... The show rivalled the Polynesian Cultural Centre on Oahu , however was slightly disappointed in the food ... Was really hoping for some lomi lomi salmon , maybe somePork lau lau , more traditional Hawaiian foods , regardless the food was very tasty and well prepared , I guess the manager has to gear the menu toward the rich haole guests that seem to freak out if they are served a beverage in a plastic cup , God forbid !!! I think the hotel and staff do a tremendous job , keep it up ! And I have to wonder of these complaining guests ever step foot outside the grounds to see the rest of the beautiful island ... Also maybe before they post their rants , they should do a spell check and punctuation check !!! For snooty rich people , they sound pretty uneducated , and yes , I'll say it again ... IGNORANT ! Beautiful hotel ", " We island hopped in Hawaii for our honeymoon and this was our final hotel. I would recommend this hotel! The complex is incredible, it's huge. It has its own monorail and boat to get you from each side which is fab! The swimming pools are amazing and they have pools specifically for kids which is good so we avoided them! Ha There is no beach at all as its all volcanic rock but this just fascinated me! The scenery is so different to the other islands ( we visited Oahu and Maui). The sunsets at this hotel are amazing and they have one restaurant where you can sit, eat your dinner and watch the sunset, it's so romantic! There is so much to do at this hotel you don't really need to leave but if you do there are two main shopping places nearby which are a nice walk or there is a complementary bus to them.They have a dolphin sanctuary in the hotel and you can swim with them however if you don't want to do that you can sit and watch others do it. They probably have a restaurant for every type of cuisine you may want as well.There is free wifi in all public areas and around the pool which is good for contact with back home. I would return and recommend this hotel, simply fantastic. ", " Stayed here three times now, great hotel in a great location if you are looking for something without the hustle and bustle of Honolulu. The lagoon tower has newly refurbished rooms which are great and if you have an ocean view room, or dolphin view room in that tower, then your view is pretty spectacular.  There is transportation between the three towers on the monorail or on a boat which operates in the afternoon. The gym/spa is fantastic and there are a number of pools, including a natural lagoon fed by the ocean which is host to a number of wildlife (turtles, fish), plus a network of 4 pools connected by slides.  The Big Island Breakfast is pretty good, a bit expensive if you don't have it included, but worth it, and there are a number of on site restaurants, some more reasonable than others. There is also a market and a group of restaurants nearby, a 20 minute walk or short drive.  The big island has a lot to offer, loads to see and this is a great base to do it all from. ", " We stayed here in October for a week. The hotel is gorgeous with beautiful grounds, pools, flora, lagoon with fish and turtles and several restaurants. Plus all of the beautiful artwork placed throughout the resort was interesting. We had a room in the Lagoon tour overlooking the lagoon, ocean, and dolphins. Our kids were able to swim with the dolphins at Dolphin Quest and they thought that was a highlight of the trip. I love that the resort is large because we got to walk a lot which I like when I'm on vacation. There is even a trail to A-bay which was nice to walk early in the morning while watching the sunrise. There is the tram and the boat in the canal if you are not up to walking. Our kids would have been happy being in the pools (the slides were fun--even for the adults)and lagoon for the entire week if we let them. Highly recommend. ", " Arrived to a dirty room, but this is highly unusual for this hotel. Have stayed here 3 times in the past. Housekeeping was very responsive. After that initial negative, everything else in the hotel was phenomenal. Gorgeous grounds, pool amazing, spa great. Fitness equipment could use some updating...treadmills have no cushion, so hard on knees. Was glad to get home to my better one. The hallways, tram, boats, ALL AMAZING. The furniture in the room was getting a little older looking, but still nice. Maybe I should have given a 4 star??? :) ", " Our family of 5 (including 3 teens) stayed here in July for a few days. Everyone enjoyed it. Very unique hotel---beautiful, surreal lagoon area. Kids snorkeled w/sea turtles, right there in the lagoon. Dolphin encounter was very good there as well. We enjoyed the many restaurant choices. The rooms weren't anything special--they must be well used. ", " once i you get over the shock of the size of the hotel and all it offer i found it so easy to get to where i wanted to spend the days, the dolphin programme is a must for any age and if you want nothing more than to lay by the many pools id choose the lagoon where you can snorkel with turtles and other sea life. The staff were more than helpful fron check in to check out.Many great places to eat. The boat landing was great and value and for a treat kpcs is a must !look forward to heading back. ", " After being back for a couple weeks I wanted to confirm my true feelings about this place....and that's the problem, we all digest things differently so here's the fail proof review you've all been waiting for. Dolphins are actually shallow water dolphins. All good. Pizza place is best place to eat on site (we ate at em all). Two lobster burgers and Dom Perignon is worth it. Hard to get strollers around the place, but be ready to walk. It's good for you. Get a seat outside at 30 min before sunset at PCK (sp) restaurant; Best kids pool the furstest one away near Ocean tower. Palace tower is OK, but if you hang in your room too much in Hawaii you shouldn't be there any way. Best excursion to go to is the Snorkelling one mid-day via Ocean Sports. Luau is way overpriced, as are all Luau's, but food is good, wait for the 2nd course meats, don't be tricked. Buy beers at Queens market grocery store and bring them to the lagoon beach. There is a fridge in your room. Don't upgrade room for a view. All rooms are dated but clean, Lagoon towers are newer. Spa is nice, workout rooms small and basement like but good equipment. Oh, and the breakfast buffet (Big Island something) is worth it, you can also order off a menu. Best 5m run: Make left out of property and run the beachfront, past Marriott, run on broken beach to almost point of inlet- left through the lava rock field, left onto main hwy, left at light. There's a great 10 mile run but you have to be adventurous and I won't tell that one. Bottomline: enjoy it, you are on vacation..I would imagine alot of these reviewers are miserable people anyways and are your typical sedintary americans. Vacations are what you make it! ", " I love this hotel, the pools and scenery... I've stayed here a couple times, and I would recommend staying in one of the newer or refurbished rooms. The other rooms are adequate, but not great for the price you are paying. wonderful staff and great ambiance... ", " Ride a tram or boat to your room. Lots to see and do. No natural sand beach, but a sand beach on a lagoon that is great for snorkeling. Bring lots of sun block. Better snorkeling is 5 miles north. Can whale watch from the property (they came real close to shore) and swim with dolphins. ", " My family and I have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa a few times and we absolutely love it! My children enjoy all the activities on the property and there is always something to do. The pools are wonderful! I can sit and watch the dolphins swimming and performing all day at Dolphin Quest! The prices of food are moderate, and since we live on Oahu, are used to the sticker shock most outsiders are not used to. If we don't eat on site, the Marketplace is an easy 15 minute walk away where there are many inexpensive dining options. We always request to stay in the Lagoon or Palace tower because I've read that the rooms are better equipped for our family. We have never had any issues with our rooms and the housekeepers are attentive. Our rooms are immaculate and very well attended to.We decided to buy a Hilton timeshare simply because we fly to Big Island yearly and want access to all the facilities offered to HGVC members. One of those perks is the shuttle which transports members to the Marketplace so we will have quicker access without having to pay crazy high parking fees for a rental car.Big Island has always been one of my favorite destinations and the Hilton Waikoloa has been a huge factor in that. We will continue to visit yearly and the Hilton is the only place we will be staying at. ", " My husband and I traveled with our daughter (1yo) to the Hilton Waikoloa for a week stay just before Christmas 2012. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and had a balcony that overlooked the dolphin lagoon, which was perfect for killing time during naptimes, as we could watch the dolphins at play. Our room with a king-size bed was very spacious, and the hotel provided a pack-and-play for our daughter to sleep in. The property is huge. There are several pools, waterslides, a golf course, a mini-golf course (essentially putt-putt, but cleanier/classier then the clown-mouth version), restaurants, live entertainment, room service, water amenities, animal sightings and beautiful decor and landscaping. On-site prices were a bit steep. Though not much nearby, the King and Queen shopping areas offered great options. (Macaroni Grill serves a great breakfast for a great price, and we also dined at Roy's.) There is a huge general-style store in the Queen shops that has anything you could need (alcohol, groceries, diapers, sushi, souvenirs, etc.). There's also a Starbucks, and some other shopping and restaurants. The King shops have very high end brands (Rolex, Tiffany) and a farmer's market on a couple days of the week.Highlights:* There is a tram (think Disney World) and a boat that travels the length of the property to move guests back and forth.* We could not get enough of watching the dolphins (6 of them) play and perform.* The poke served at the bar/restaurant near the lobby is excellent.* The table-side prepared guacamole at the Cantina restaurant was also excellent.* The made-to-order omelets at the breakfast buffet were pretty good, and fast.* The Lagoon Grill is probably our favorite dining spot on the property - you can watch the dolphins or a football game on TV, they have a decent menu (the ahi tuna burger is really good), they have happy hour specials and a full bar to go with, and the staff are friendly.* We also liked the coffee shop on the main floor of the Lagoon Tower for quick breakfast (croissant sandwiches and quiche) and coffees.Unexpected details that stand out:* The staff in the buffet restaurant are very chatty and may tell you some funny stories about, well, anything.* About 2 dozen wild cats seem to reside near the golf course and when we walked that way one day (quite a ways from the side of the resort we were staying on) there was at least 2 snoozing on every bump of every hill leading to the course.* A FLEET of Myna birds seems to live in the trees in the courtyard of the Lagoon Tower. It's only really noticeable in the evening (I guess they have a Happy Hour too) and you'd hear sporadic uprisings throughout the night, but I generally did not think it was anywhere near as bad as the reviews on here led me to believe.* My daughter loved the resident parrots that are often on their perches in the open air lobby area.* There are HUNDREDS of serious statues on this property. They all seem to have an Asian theme (very much reminded us of our trip to China) and they are all pretty spectacular.* The \"beach\" at the main lagoon is full of sea turtles, paddle boats, paddleboarders and snorklers and seemed to be most popular this time of the wear (we heard it was the warmest option)...just not me (still way too cold!).* The spa was really nice, not cheap if you get one of their services, but the facility is spacious, relaxing and welcoming. You can still use the locker room if you use the gym, and this gives you access to a locker, the private outdoor hot tub and sunning area, saunas,showers and provided amenities, bathrobe, etc. This was a nice treat for \"parent time off\" for us when one was covering nap time.Cons:* The pools are NOT heated. Probably no big deal in the summer. However, as much as the air temperature is in the high 70s/80s in December, the pools were ridiculous so I am sad I could not get any swim time with my daughter. Had we known this, we would likely have gone somewhere else entirely for vacation.* The Lagoon Spoon - We went here a couple mornings with the hope that \"Today I will find something to eat here\" because we weren't hungry enough to justify the $30/p at a buffet. No luck. Nothing sounded appealing when it came down to it. The lady that worked here said that even the kids pick the gummy sharks off their cereal. (Seriously. Gummy sharks.)As a whole, we had a fantastic vacation and always love to visit Hawaii. We are glad that we checked out one of the islands we don't usually consider. ", " This resort has breathtaking views everywhere. Huge property and has everything you need on site. Relaxing atmosphere and never felt crowded. Staff is friendly and rooms are very clean. The food is quite expensive but worth it. Will definitely be back to this resort. ", " This was our second time staying at the Hilton Waikoloa and we loved it. We booked a room through the Hilton site with an option to upgrade to the Lagoon Tower if available - fortunately it was. We had a very nice, recently updated room overlooking the lagoon, dolphins, and ocean. The pools are great. We spent most of our time at the lagoon, which was very popular. The kids loved snorkeling there and seeing the sea turtles. The Hitlon grounds are beautiful, and the walk between the Hilton and Marriott along the ocean is gorgeous, especially in the morning just after sunrise and at sunset time. The food is pretty good, but expensive for what you get. Other than that, this is a great choice and we had a wonderful time there. ", " We've stayed before at the nearby Mauna Kea, and still think that hotel is beautiful, and ideal for couples. But for a vacation with our 5-year old along, the Hilton was out of this world. Each of us had a great vacation.Plusses:--monorail and boat are fun and quick, or if you want exercise and are mobile, it's great to burn off vacation calories with a pleasant 15 min. stroll around the property before and after meals.--so large that you don't get bored: I'm sure I didn't see much of the resort near the other towers--Lagoon Tower was beautiful and so convenient for families: would definitely stay here again--food was fairly priced for Hawaii and very tasty, big variety of restaurants--good reasonable options too like Cereal Spoon in the morning; super-delicious yogurt parfait with fresh fruit and delicious granola, for only $5--near the Queen's Marketplace (the grocery/reasonably priced souvenir store in there is a godsend), King's Shops too (helpful to have a Macy's nearby if you forgot something)--beautiful hiking trails off property--beautiful pools--beautiful wildlife around the resort: nenes, rare turtles, parrots, etc.: endless things for a child not to get bored--great kids camp; son had the time of his life there--even the nice restaurants are kid-friendly--gym is fine; I enjoyed the stretch class (though you need to pay $10)--FANTASTIC treatments in the spa: lomi lomi was especially good--some of the resort shops were very fairly priced; I don't normally buy clothes at resorts (prices too jacked up) but Kohala Collection clothes were very cute, reasonably priced; I was inspired to actually stock up on things moms don't usually have time to buy (cute sundresses!) while my son was enjoying Kids Club or kayaking with Dad--friendly staff--fun to look at the dolphins next to the lagoon pool--lots of interesting pathways through the resort--delicious lattes in the Waikoloa Coffee Co.--quiet rooms, couldn't hear neighbors--didn't see rooms in other towers, but Lagoon Tower rooms were beautifulMinuses:--pools were freezing; they're not heated--there's no real beach: you are looking at the beautiful rocky ocean shoreline, and there's a manmade lagoon beach--if you're not very mobile, the tram is nice, but it's not as easy to get around as a hotel that's all one building--much of the art in the \"museum walkways\" are clearly reproductions or \"in the styles of,\" and I thought they were tacky (though less observant others seem to like them)--would be nice if Waikoloa Coffee Co. had a wider breakfast menu (if they had the coconut muffins from the breakfast buffet, we would have been there every day!)--the birds were not nearly as annoying as I expected them to be from other reviews, as they only bleep in the morning and at dusk; but if you're a super light-sleeper and don't wear earplugs this could be a problem for youMy son said on the 3rd day: \"I want to live here.\" We also had a very relaxing time (though my husband would prefer to go somewhere with warmer pools if we weren't outvoting him). ", " We were at the Hilton Waikoloa in November (myself, husband, 2 teenage boys) and had a great time! This was our third trip there. I found the property to have been maintained very well, and LOTS of new artwork/statues have been added since our last visit 8 years ago. Having a room overlooking the dolphins was wonderful. The best thing about this resort is the natural lagoon where the giant sea turtles come in and swim side by side with you. FABULOUS! It is a HUGE property with a Disney feel....we like that. The Luau was great..expensive... but I have to say the food was good and the show entertaining. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, and no complaints on any of the meals we had here. My only complaint was that we did not receive leis at check in (I think we did in the past). We also visited the Ritz Carlton in Maui this trip and they did give us leis there. Just a little added touch that would be nice :) Will return again and again...we love this property!!!! ", " We stayed for ten days mid December. I don't have any complaints. Anyone who complains about the resort being too big or too expensive or this or that has not done due diligence before booking this hotel. It is very clearly described in many, many reviews. I find it enjoyable to walk from one end of the resort to the other so that I can see all the artwork and natural beauty of the property. All the hotel personnel are very accomodating and friendly. The ladies at Waikoloa Coffee Company at the Lagoon Tower are so friendly and welcoming. We only ate breakfast at the hotel - at Waikoloa Coffee Co. and had our other meals outside the resort. We eat at the farmer's market if possible - you can get some really good food there for a very good price. We also enjoy Sansei sushi at the Queen's Marketplace. It is nice that the hotel empties the refrigerator so you can buy your own beverages to have in-room. We are hilton gold members so we get free internet, $10 per person per day to use for food at the resort; free dvd movie rentals. After a few days at the hotel we figured out the happy hour goes from 2 pm to 10 pm. There is a welcome/info board in the lobby that tells you about this. It starts at one pool area from 2-3 then moves to the next location from 3-4, and so on. ", " My husband and I were just recently married on December 12th at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! What a beautiful location and dream vacation! Staff members Cheryl Shoemaker and Robin Paulos went above and beyond to make sure that we were treated like royalty the entire week we were staying at the hilton! I worked with cheryl closely for over six months planning this wedding! She helped me with everything down to the smallest details!!! I had no idea how to go about a destination wedding and I would recommend cheryl and this location to everyone! We had 36 guests that came in from the mainland! My whole family was so pleased by the beauty and friendly staff! Plus there are so many activites and restaurants on site that kept my friends and family busy! We are just so greatful for cheryl and the hilton for everything they did!! I hope that general manager debi bishop sees how pleased we are!!! ", " This was our first visit to the big island, and we had never stayed in a resort like this before. Yes, it's big - REALLY big. And the food is expensive. But, it has lush greenery, a private lagoon, an adults only pool (which we used often), and lots of other amenities. When we wanted to go snorkeling, the staff that rented our equipment gave us some great advice on where to go off the resort property. Our room overlooked the ocean - the decor is a bit dated, but the bed was comfy and everything worked just perfectly. We actually decided to extend our stay for one additional day, and the front desk staff was very very helpful! I would recommend this hotel to other travelers, and we'll be back again. ", " Although I've been to the Big Island several times previously, this was the first time I stayed at this property.Lovely setting that knocks you out initially with its sheer size and beauty.It's a large place that takes a bit of time to learn how to get around.Fortunately, there is a motorized tram system and canal system with boats that can take you to your room or other venues on the property if you don't want to walk the property.There is a plethora of eateries on site and some serve very good food with stunning views. Be aware that your pocketbook will be significantly smaller especially if traveling with a family!The rooms were nicely appointed and of more than adequate size. My room in the Lagoon Tower had partial ocean view and was gorgeous view from my lanai.My room had a small refrigerator and a room safe ( but I did not discover the safe until later in the stay! It is inside the lowest drawer in the drawers below the TV)Service was very good, but if you're used to crisp service with alacrity, you may be initially disappointed. There is a laid-backfeel to the staff interaction with guests that will likely irritate Type A personalities. If you've come to the Islands to get away from work or other stressors, just accept the Island style and \"hang loose\"Note that there is no beach front at this hotel but there is a bus service from the hotel to local shopping in Waikoloa resort area and to a nice beach next door adjacent to the Marriott property.The resort is about 1/2 hour from the Kona airport and convenient to beaches and water activities on the West side of the Island. It is less convenient to the Volcano National Park or Tropical Gardens and Akaka Falls which are closer to Hilo area on East side of the Island. There are car rental agents and tour booking agents on-site.An additional attraction is Dolphin Quest and you pay to swim with dolphins. You can view the dolphins swimming in their lagoon for free. There are very nice but pricey golf courses at Waikoloa and at resorts a few miles north in Kohala area.There is an expansive pool area and lagoon at the resort and separate children and adult pool areas, which is a nice idea.The Mahalo Lounge had very good music at night and large screens mostly benefitting sports enthusiasts.Alas, the lounge area was largely empty after sunset, despite a good appetizer menu and drinks as well as good music.You should have a car to get around this large island which has limited public transportation. Add 15-20 dollars per day for resort self/valet parking.One thing that does irritate me is the \"Resort fee\" of $25/day for Internet access and other amenities at the resort that you may or may not use.Fortunately for Gold and Diamond Hilton Honors members you can get food vouchers for $10 each, limit two to a room per day and get complimentary wi-fi.There is free wi-fi access in some public areas at the resort I believe.A final note is to consider renting a condo in Waikoloa area if you have two couples or a family of four or larger.If you are not simply staying at the resort all of the time , then you are paying a lot of money for an opulent place to sleep.At a condo, you can save lots on the food bill by being to shop local groceries and prepare some or all meals at your placeAnd keep left-overs.My sisters stay frequently at the Hilton Grand Vacation properties nearby.The Shores at Waikoloa were a nice property I stayed at previously (but was 10 years ago so don't know how good they are now) ", " This resort has everything - multiple pools, lush landscaped gardens, amazing views, artwork throughout ......even a monorail! But best of all is the friendliness and genuine hospitality of the staff who work here. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone is smiling - you would too if you worked here. For example, yesterday we were taking our rental car to a beautiful nearby beach - Hapuna State Park. The hotel provides beach towels at the valet area in front of the hotel, you just sign them out. While we were doing that Mindy (one of the staff) also offered us beach chairs, a cooler, a boogie board and told us where to buy the best lunch to bring to the beach (Island Gourmet Market in the shops down the road). So we set off for a couple of hours with everything we needed for a great day out - thanks to Mindy! The theming and attention to detail in the grounds and in the hotel is unbelievable. You can snorkel in their expansive saltwater lagoon, swim under waterfalls, watch dolphins frolicking in the dolphin pools - even swim with them if you wish (at an additional charge).Even though I was to attend a convention, you wouldn't even know there was a large convention in progress because of the way the resort is set up.We would definitely recommend this wonderful property. ", " I strongly question the bias or intelligence of the person who rates this hotel a one circle. It's a fabulous place and though the rooms may need a small update, they are roomy, quiet, very clean and just very satisfactory. The grounds are truly great, there is good food to be had at a reasonable price, the ocean shoreline is wonderful and the staff is first rate. Our only complaint was internet service and the staff busted rear to make it right--and did. It was a great stay. ", " We have now made 4 trips to the resort and find it relaxing and stimulating. On days we just want peace and quiet we visit one of the smaller pools. For the adventure days we snorkel in the lagoon, watch the dolphin training, and finish off with the hibachi grill. Highly recommend for couples and families alike ", " My husband planned a surprise private dinner with the Banquet Department. Kelsey(sorry if spelling is wrong) was our server. I just want to let all of you know what a wonderful and unique experience this was for me. My husband and I were married at this property in 2001 at the chapel. This is also the same place where the private dinner occurred. It brought back so many wonderful memories in addition to making new ones. Our server was the most delightful, warm, and generous person. Our children were with us and as you may expect cannot sit still for very long. (Honestly, at this beautiful property who can sit still for very long?) Kelsey handled it like a pro! She truly took care of every detail. She even had a \"to go\" box ready for the leftover pizza that was part of the children's meal!! Our \"adult\" food was outstanding as well. Mahalo for the chocolate ukulele! YUMMMM!!!!! If you really want to give your loved one a night to remember I highly recommend a private dining experience. Kelsey brought the spirit of Aloha to us and made us feel like the only people in the world. Thank-you for the kindness. Words cannot express my gratitude for your graciousness, knowledge of the island, and humor! The night ended with hugs for everyone. It doesn't get better than that! I look forward to our return and seeing you again! ALOHA Hilton Waikola ", " What a magical place to be at. The landscaping, the art, the location, the roomy rooms. So much offered there that you can save a lot despite the higher room rate. You can swim with the dolphins and don't have to chase them in the pacific; you can swim with sea turtles without dishing out big $$$ for a boat trip, you can snorkel with real fish without an expensive tour - Hilton has it right there for you at no extra cost. The architecture is just impressive and despite the high number of rooms it is not crowded anywhere really. You get pampered for sure and won't want to leave. The recently implemented resort fee though is hard to swallow and gives you little extra and hardly anything you need. I wish they wouldn't have done that. Beware of the parking fees. ", " Everything we needed was at the resort - although a microwave would be a nice addition to the room. We used the fitness center, spa, and hot tubs (although there could be more of these spread throughout the property for guests to more easily enjoy). There are several shops and a number of restaurants (be prepared to pay resort prices) on site. The tram and shuttle boat are a nice service. While the luau seemed to stall between dinner and entertainment - leaving several of us wondering if it were over - the food was delicious and plentiful and we enjoyed the show. We only went to the breakfast buffet one day; there were plenty of choices but at $30 per person it simply was not a good value for my husband and I. ", " Let me say, if you have kids, I don't see how it could get any better than this. The Lagoon pool with the waterslide and grotto are amazing. We have two boys, 5 and 9 and they could've spent all day going down the waterslide. The sand-bottomed pool is also unique and good for the younger children. On the other side of the complex, at the Ocean Tower, is another smaller pool, also with a smaller but faster waterslide that my boys liked nearly as much.Another highlight for them were the tram and boat rides that take you from one end of the complex to the other. Yes, you do have to wait sometimes, and yes, it can take awhile to get from one end to the other, but aren't you on vacation?? How big of a hurry are you in? Our kids loved the tram and wanted to ride it every time we went out.The grounds of the hotel are amazing, with interesting sculptures nearly everywhere. There are also great pieces of art along the hotel pathways. We stayed at the Palace Tower, and even though it doesn't have its own pool, we thought it was really magnificent inside. The room we had was bigger and nicer than I had expected.The staff all seemed friendly, and the grounds are really clean. The lagoon is unbelievable. There are all kinds of fish and sea turtles, and you can swim and snorkel, or rent paddleboards or canoes.All in all, we thought the hotel was great and highly recommend it. ", " We came here for Thanksgiving ths year. The Lagoon Tower deluxe room was all we could expect. Tropical breezes, breaking surf, roomy. Clean, well maintained. It is Hawaii so don't stay here if you are on a budget. The Thansgiving dinner was really good, home cooked, the more so as they fed 3-400 people. This side of the ng island s isolated so come here only if you like the resort type of experience ", " This was our second time to the HWV, and yes it is HUGE, it has WILDLIFE in it, and there is some walking to do also! All of these things we ADORE!Everything everywhere is simply GORGEOUS, I just cannot say enough great things about this magical place to us. My wife and I were married here in 2001 and was amazed so much we stayed almost 1.5 weeks longer than we had initially planned. Coming back this time with our children, we were amazed even moreso. The Dolphin adventure, the pools, the lagoon, all simply OUTSTANDING!! The kids loved everything especially the Ice Cream bar of course over by the waterfalls and slides. The sand pool leading into the main pool was a hit, and the ultra huge checkers set was loved as well. We played mini golf and enjoyed Buddha point and the hammocks. We had an Ocean View in Ocean Tower and it was definitely worth it!! The staff here give their very best in most all cases, and the food is very very good, everyone keeps saying pricey?? Uh HELLO, you are staying at a WORLD CLASS RESORT!!!The rooms are great, and the new TV's and DVDs, and internet are excellent. If you complain about wifi cost, um hello its free all over the resort!! And if you are an Hhonors member you get free WifFi in the rooms anyway, The beauty of this resort and its food and staff, are immeasurable.Also for valet parking, if you are an Hhonors member (which you should be!) it goes from 15.00 for self parking to 21.00 for valet, for 6.00 a day DEFINITELY valet it! Why let something so petty bother you when visiting IMHO the BEST Resort in all Hawai'i Nei.I can name several staff by name who were OUTSTANDING to my family, we also used the Camp Menehune for the kids one evening and it went GREAT!If you understand truly what Hawai'i Nei is, and the Spirit of Aloha means, you can sincerely find it in most of the staff here, it is a wonderful experience.The breakfast buffet is AMAZING fresh Hawaiian pineapple, a host of about everything you could want, and the coconut syrup, Portuguese sausage, and corned beef hash, as well as bacon and omelette were incredible!We had an amazing dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company, Warren was our server and made the dining experience at the KPC incredible! We tried exactly what he recommended Monchong dish was OUTSTANDING! And the Mauna Kea desert with Kona coffee topped it all off the charts!! He was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and options, and his Aloha spirit really made the experience incredible. We did the Ali'i seating with champagne and a beef sirloin & risotto starter that were out of this world. Did I mention we sat right next to the Pacific Ocean?! In the distance Haleakala on Maui broke through the clouds, and the Hilton Waikoloa Village right there made this dinner more than memorable. We had our wedding dinner here back in 2001 and it has improved if it was even possible!! CAN'T RECOMMEND ENOUGHAlso I arranged with their special services a private dinner for my family at the Wedding Chapel Lanai (Hale Aloha) which was well done (Kelsey was our server) and more than memorable, the way she had with my family, and sitting at the Chapel for a dinner service with the Wife I married there and the kids created from our marriage was very special. It was as beautiful as could be, and again I cannot say enough KUDOS for this!The boats in the canal, the monorail ride to get from one side to the other was always and is a treat. We loved it so much again, we have already scheduled a return next year!This is GREAT for families, and the wild birds you can take pics with, the dolphins, the Honu in the lagoon (did I mention the INCREDIBLE snorkling here?!) makes for a PERFECTLY Ono experience! Its also great for romance and couples and I can attest!HWV, you have a special place in our hearts, and we cannot wait to be there again. Each time we have left it has made it harder and harder to leave Hawai'i!!Mahalo Nui Loa! ", " Great place to stay in Kona,It is a large resort but has a Train that takes you to your room from the lobby!It runs about every 10-15 min.If you do not want the train there is a Boat that will wind through the complex at a more leisurely pace and runs every 20 min. You might even see the African Cranes,There are numerous towers that have your rooms with different views and have different themes and many restaurants throughout and there is artwork everywhere with a predominantly Asian motif and sculptures,There is great shopping near the lobby that has a few big name stores but the prices are reasonable.The resort is on the west side if the Big Island and has Awesome sunset views and is not as rainy as Hilo,We played the Kings Golf Course and it was wonderful! Not rushed and what magnificent views! You might even be lucky enough to see the wild goats trimming the fairwaysFantastic place, I will return!! ", " CUSTOMER SERVICE: Outstanding. We had some trouble with our airport rental car not starting, but the valet guy Dennis was efficiently hospitable in making sure we got to our dinner reservation off campus. He went out of his way to ensure we had a delightful evening despite the bad circumstance. In fact, the entire staff, from the concierge to the front desk to the parrot girls to the pool attendants to everyone in between was friendly and accomadating.FOOD: Flavor good to great. Price value average for a nice resort. One must try the fresh guacamole at the cantina. Also sampled the buffet breakfast, the pizza restaurant, and the Japanese restaurant. All tasty and nutricious. If you visit the Japanese restaurant ask for Byron. Very friendly and efficent server.GROUNDS: Neat, clean, and SPACIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL! The artwork statues and paintings are positioned throughout the grounds, and walkways between the lobby and room towers. The art is eclectic and shows the multicultural heritage of the Hawaiin islands. Everything from American contemporary to Chinese and Japanese.ACTIVITIES: A myriad of things to do, from swimming with the dolphins to all types of water sports: kayaks, paddle-boards, paddle-boats, and sliding. LOVED the long winding water slide.AMBIENCE: There's been some discussion about some native birds showing up in the trees on site before sunset and before sunrise. This is true, however my girlfriend and I found their squaking humorous and not the least bit annoying. They stay for only a short time. If you are a light sleeper you may want to request a room with minimal bird noise. There are a few ferrel cats and ferrets sunbathing together in perfect harmony near the golf course which are well cared for by island volunteers.GETTING AROUND: A large resort, but getting around is made simple by way of a ground level monorail-like train and boat. My girlfriend and I walked most of the time. The route from the main lobby to the rooms is shaded and filled with fascinating artwork. The resort has valet service and a self-parking lot.A great resort. Fun for adults and children alike. ", " We stayed with our three kids in August 2012. After a week on busy Oahu, this was a great place to relax and unwind. The older kids missed the nightlife on the other island but were still happy to be in paradise! The only downside to this place is there is no direct beach access, but there are turtles and sealife galore in the lagoon...no need to drive anywhere to interact with these creatures EASILY and OFTEN in the lagoon. The pool are amazing. The staff is friendly. The black sand beach is five minutes away...very hot sand there, so bring water shoes. There are a gazillion places to take beautiful photos of your family. Suggestion...invest in an underwater camera and bring it with you to the lagoon to take pics of the sea turtles, your kids on paddle boards, water bikes, etc. I did and we have awesome water pictures from the trip! The Palace towering is stunning, but a far walk from the lagoon and kids' pool. We are returning in April and will stay in the Lagoon tower for better access. It's beautiful!!!!!!! ", " I first stayed at this hotel shortly after it was built (when it was a Hyatt) and loved it so much I had to stay there again when I was back on Hawaii. The Waikoloa Village was built by Hyatt but is now run by Hilton. Normally I prefer to stay at boutique hotels but this property is so unique that I can overlook the negatives of staying in such a large property. The Waikoloa Village is almost like 3 hotels spread over a huge area of rugged volcanic coastline with a large golf course behind it. They have a monorail-type tram if you want to move around the vast property fairly fast or a lovely little boat system for more enjoyable, leisurely travel through the various lagoons and canals. I especially enjoyed taking the little boats to and from the restaurants since it's a relaxing way to begin and end the meal. The outdoor, covered walkways connecting the various buildings are lined with beautiful artwork and sculptures so sometimes we preferred to use them just to enjoy the art. Lots of walking is usually necessary to go between the many restaurants, pools, etc on the property but they've done such a beautiful job of landscaping that I enjoyed the exercise. However, even with the tram and boat system, the Waikoloa Village is so spread out that it may not be a good choice for someone with walking difficulties.  The service was consistently wonderful and unobtrusive all over the property. My only disappointment was that we didn't stay long enough to have another dinner at the Kamuela ( aka KPC). Loved having breakfast overlooking the ocean each morning. Our rate included breakfast which we felt saved us money. We had an oceanview room in the Palace Tower and I loved the view from our lanai. It was nice to see how the beautiful landscaping had matured over the past 20 years. Our king bed was very comfortable and the room was larger than a typical hotel room and well-designed. This is a wonderful resort filled with a wide variety of activities. My favorite was to hang around the dolphin pool and just watch them. I most enjoyed it in the early morning and twilight hours when the dolphins would leap and dance on their tails all alone in their lagoon. I also enjoyed swimming in the massive lagoon pool with its quiet coves and behind-the-waterfall hideaways. The Waikoloa Village is a lovely oasis from which you can easily explore the Big Island and I would happily stay here again. ", " First of all, YES the hotel is big! I can not believe that people are complaining about this. Look up things like this before you stay somewhere and complain about it. I loved the size of this hotel. The birds - yep there are birds. We stayed in the ocean view tower and our room was literally right where they chirp at sunset, but guess what, if you close the door, you can barely hear them. Again, I can't believe people are complaining about something like this. Even if there was something the hotel could do about it, I hope they don't! It's nice to see an abundance of wildlife. If this really bothers you, we'll quite frankly, harden up. Birds chirping is not the end of the world. We are from Australia and had just come from La and Vegas where there are no birds. It was so eery not hearing any birds at sunset or in the morning. It was refreshing to come here and hear them, happily chirping. Waking up and hearing birds singing is a wonderful thing to wake up to, not that they woke us, but days where we had tours and were up, it was nice to listen too. I didn't find the food overpriced and ate at 5 restaurants there, no complaints about any of the food, I loved the breakfast buffet!Nice to see the turtles have somewhat of a sanctuary where they can come and go as they please, clearly they choose to stay. It was also very nice to see that the cats seem to be taken care of. They are desexed and I'm pretty sure I saw feeding stations for them behind the hotel? That is SO nice to see! It's not they're fault they are stray so I'm glad they are being cared for. This hotel was paradise and we will definitely be coming back! ", " Not sure how to describe it - Out of the world.It is THE MOST spectacular resorts I have ever visited. You enter it and feel it. The area is huge and is optimally utilized for towers and water pools. There is an internal tram and boats to help you commute from one tower to another. The boat rides in itself are more than relaxing. The is a variety in restaurants - some built right at the beach and looks amazing with torch lights at night; another is like a boat station. Food at all the of these places is worth a try. the pools, artificially created water falls, bridges to connect one place to another gives a luxury feeling of stay. Just sit for a while at the Budha point and feel the air - forget the world. There is also a golf course.  During the day there are so many so many activities to do - you will love each to it. At night/evening, after good warm meal at one of the restaurants inside the resort, we would just sit quietly on the beach just enjoying the night with burning torch lights and sound of waves lashing on the shore.The experience is unforgettable. ", " Not being an elite Hilton Honors member, I was a bit nervous about just being just another face in a crowd of guests. However, hours before arrival, I made a call to Owana Wilcox, the front desk manager. Her voice was warm, professional and I'll never forget her words when I mentioned that my spouse and I would be celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. With a laugh which warmed the soul, she said, \"I will work my magic.\" These were anything but empty words. We were assigned a top floor, spacious, beachfront room in the lagoon tower, overlooking the dolphin lagoon. We were treated to complimentary internet, champagne, scrumptious chocolate covered strawberries, \"Happy Anniversary\" spelled out with smooth pebbles on the bedspread and a voicemail welcome message from management. Owana and her team had indeed gone all out to make us feel not only welcome but valued. Being that the dolphins were calving, it was hard to step away from our balcony. The newest baby dophin was but 4 days old upon arrival. When I walked to the lobby to thank Owana in person, she was quick to come out of what must no doubt be a busy office, to say hello. This is after all, the largest resort in all of Hawaii. She greeted with outstretched arms, a beautiful smile, and sincere joy knowing her guests were happy. It may sound hyperbolic but honestly, she and her staff made me feel like I was among family. The resort itself is lovely with its lush green grounds, Pacific Rim artwork, waterfalls, large swimming pools, and well placed eateries as well as shops. The ocean waters flow directly into a man made river where tropical fish and numerous sea turtles, perfect on-site snorkeling. The day before our departure, while speaking with super courteous Wesley the concierge, I made mention that the our flight home wouldn't be till after nine. He smiled, asked me to wait a moment, and disappeared into the back office. Upon his return, he told me that he had spoken with Owana, Ms. Wilcox, and we were gifted with a 7 pm late check-out at no extra charge. This was indeed pineapple on the upside down cake, a true treat! Special mention should also be made of Ryan Tomm, and General Manager Debi Bishop, for they all conspired as a team to make this hotel stay one of the best ever. Such memories of kindness will never be forgotten. Mahalo ", " My husband and I stayed at Hilton Waikoloa Village 11/5 - 11/9 and I have nothing but great things to say about our experience. The property is extremely well maintained, the grounds are beautiful and the staff goes above and beyond. We are Hilton Honors members I'm not sure if that contributed to the Ocean front upgrade we were given at the Ocean Tower but I'm sure glad we were given the upgrade. The room was amazing and the view to die for, while the birds are annoyingly loud early in the morning if you sleep like we do it is hardly a bother. The Ocean Tower is about a 5-10 minute walk from the main lobby while I'm guessing this can be an annoyance for some I wasn't bothered by the walk at all. The corrider that leads to the tower is filled with beautiful art work that more than makes up for the walk. Also the tram is an excellent option if you're just to tired to walk. My husband and I greatly enjoyed walking around the property very early in the morning the views and serene setting are very inspiring and relaxing. I don't have one complaint and look forward to visiting again next year. ", " We stayed for 9 days in late January. The ground were beautiful as was the room. Our room in the Lagoon Tower was recently remodeled and very nice. The food was top notch at every restaurant we tried, however the prices were a little high. This is a first class resort and would gladly return if given the opportunity. ", " We are big fans of the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and decided to check out the Big Island and try the Hilton Waikoloa Village. WOW - this resort is paradise - it far exceeded our expectations. We were able to upgrade to a deluxe ocean and dolphin view in the Lagoon Tower 3rd floor and the view was spectacular - could not get any better. We could hear the ocean and dolphins and slept w/the patio door open partially every night. The room itself was just a nice as in the pictures - loved the double sinks in the bathroom since it was me, my hubby and two boys - I could have my own sink. I thought the beds were very comfortable - and we are used to sleeping on a Tempurpedic at home. Loved everything about this place - coffee shop was just below our door to our room, the quiche there is great - a value compared to other restaurants there (yes things are very expensive), got a huge piece my husband and I could share 3 mornings in a row. Coffee was expensive at $5 a cup- but great. Every single person who worked there at the shop was super friendly.Concerning the bird noise others have mentioned - yes, you can hear birds at dawn and dusk - but - even with our patio door partially opened they never woke us up. It was not that bad - and we thought it was neat to hear the sounds of nature. Regarding the roaming cats others have mentioned - we saw at least 5 different cats daily - but they did not bother anyone, were not any dirtier than a pet cat, and my kids loved seeing them everyday. The dolphins at the resort were quite a treat as well - also liked the turtles, etc....saw several in the lagoon and in ocean right there at property.Concerning the big property and long walks others have mentioned - it really isn't that long of a walk from one end of the property to the other if you are an able bodied person. It's pleasant with art work, or paradise to look at if you walk outside on the paths. We only took the tram once and boat once just so the kids could say they did it. We never felt crowded and nothing ever seemed noisy, never had to wait for elevators or anything but yet the place was almost 100% occupied while we were there.Pools - excellent! So many different ones to try, we did them all and the kids loved them all. We also did the mini golf course twice, the boys loved it and what a beautiful place to play it right by the ocean. Tennis courts - my husband and I did the group lesson one AM but we were the only ones so it was like a semi-private. The pro was very good and super nice. This is your best bet because if you do a lesson, you also get a free hour on a court the same day. If you just rent a court it costs $35 an hour. Parking secret that someone else mentioned - if you stay in Lagoon Tower, this is ideal for the self parking lot. Don't bother going back up to the lobby. You can cut through by the timeshare desk, go down the stairs and walk past the Kohala Spa desk, past and through the tennis courts and boom you're right there in the self parking lot. Someone else mentioned a gate being locked at 7 PM but not sure what they were talking about - we saw not locked gate that you had to get through ever.People who have complained about the rooms of this property must have stayed in the Palace or Ocean tower. That seems to be what I read before we booked, those must be the outdated ones people are taling about. We made sure to book in Lagoon. We were sad to leave and tried to extend our stay a few days but could not change our flights. We left and went to Waikiki to stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village for 9 days and although we love it there, it felt like a step down after staying at Hilton Waikoloa. I sure hope I get to go back! ", " My favorite hotel on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island. There's always something fun to do. Our grandson and his friend were able to swim with the dolphins. When they weren't swimming with the dolphins, they were enjoying the pools and slides. We all went snorkeling in the lagoon. The boys also enjoyed the paddle boats and other amenities including shopping. We loved dining at Imari. ", " Having read the reviews here I was not expecting a whole lot. Some are good and some are bad - this happens everywhere so I always travel and consider the \"grain of salt\"!We arrived at this immaculately groomed property in the evening after a VERY long day of travel. Check in was seamless and we went to our room (6313 in the Lagoon Tower). We took our own luggage as we travel pretty light. Our room was gorgeous and over looked the dolphin enclosures (there were three new babies - so fun to watch!) ocean and the lagoon. The most amazing sunrises and sunsets. The room was above well appointed with a huge closet, doubled sink bath, and massive shower (no tub but that is fine for us), large flat screen television and super comfortable bed. The furnishings were very modern.The resort is HUGE - we never took the boat or the tram as we are very impatient and found walking a better form of transportation. They seemed to run on about a 15 minute schedule and looked a bit slow.The food and drinks are expensive but Hawaii in general is very expensive! If you consider other resorts in other countries, it is about what you will pay. We never ate dinner there, just breakfast and a couple of lunches.The grounds are strikingly beautiful and perfectly manicured. Kudos to the ground crews. I don't think I ever saw even a speck of trash!!!There are a couple of pool areas. The main pool is MASSIVE, lots of chairs and clean beyond belief. There is a waterfall cave as well as a slide (I am 45 and felt like a kid on that slide!!). The other pool is the adult pool - we never went there as it was over by the Ocean Tower. We were too lazy to trek all the way over there!The lagoon is really neat. They have kayaks, paddle-boards, and snorkeling. While we were there the water was very clear and you could see turtles (we saw at least 5 different ones in one day) and many colorful fish. Plenty of seating choices here too. Overall, we had a fabulous trip and would stay here again! ", " This is the best resort in the world accoding to me. It is spread out in a semi circle with a lagoon which connects tot he ocean. The hotel is so big and spread out that you have to take a choo choo train to go to your room or you can take a small boat. The rooms are very nice and if you stay facing the ocean you get the most beautiful view. My kids were so impressed that they have asked me to take back to the same hotel every 5 years.Also they have Dolphin Quest, where you can play with Dolphins, or you can canoe or padde boat in the lagoon.There is a mall right across the hotel and you can find all kind of food, and we ate there as the restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive. We had the bed and breakfast package and the breakfst was excellent, with all kind of fresh juices. ", " I stayed at this megahotel/resort for four nights as part of a conference. I always travel on a budget and this is the first time I stayed at any resort type of hotel. And I have to admit that it feels great!I don't want to talk about everything since most is covered in various reviews. I just want to point out that this resort is huge! You can either take the tram or a boat (guess what), or you can walk between places. Try not to stay in Ocean Tower because it's far from everything. But it's also quiet and has adult only pools. I stayed in Palace Tower and the rooms are large, love the little balcony and the semi walk-in closet.Overall the hotel is comfortable to look at. The Asian decorations are everywhere and are beautiful. The little wedding chapel is cute. The sunset view is breathtaking (I've uploaded a photo). I didn't spend much time at the pools because I prefer natural beaches. The Hapuna Beach just a little north of this resort is the most beautiful beach I've seen on Big Island. Plus this would be a great place to bring family because of the dolphins and pools. You don't have to drive anywhere to have fun. ", " Multiple pools including a salt water lagoon and hot tubs , made this a fun yet relaxing stay. Plenty of lounge chairs all around the resort offered varying views. Amazing art work , wide variety of restaurants (Chinese, Japanese, pizza, pub, grill) and very friendly staff highlighted our stay. The tram makes the distances easy to navigate for those want to use it. The ocean views are incredible. No words can describe them. The food and drink prices were high but the frig in the room allowed us to keep fresh fruit etc. handy and because the portions are generous we were able to share some meals. The food was good but nothing outstanding. The laua should be done at least once. A good show! We hope to return again! ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for 2 nights in October. It was the first hotel we stayed in on the Big Island. Cannot say enough about the resort. It is fantastic. The grounds are beautiful, the setting is awesome. The pools are amazing, the lagoon is very interesting as it is water from the ocean. We saw turtles swimming, resting, saw lots of fish. The sunsets are beautiful from this location. The room was very adequate, nice king size bed, very comfortable, bedding was great. The staff was friendly , no problems with check in or check out. The only problem is you are stuck for food. The Chinese restaurant was just fantastic, the food is delicious. The brunch is very good. Never ate at the nice restaurant by the ocean, just at poolside. This is a very nice resort. We would stay at the Hilton Waikoloa if we ever come back to the Big Island.Very very niceKC Calgary Alberta Canada ", " My wife and I stayed here before our last child was born 17 years ago, and stayed this year for our 25th anniversary. We have always loved the grounds, Dolphin Quest, the kind of fantasy/park feel to the place. A new dolphin was born while we were there and we saw it from our room when it was about 4 hours old!The staff is excellent here! Real Aloha spirit and I don't think we had one bad interaction with a staff person. Special mention to Dave and Rose at the Big Island Breakfast, Kerwin at the Lagoon Grill and Rowena at the Big Island Cantina. The conceirges we worked with including Gayla were very helpful as well.Ask for the Kona Colada adult drink (off menu) and get the table side Guacamole at the Cantina. The Tuna sandwich/burger at the Lagoon Grill was yummy. As others have mentioned the food prices were a bit high (though in line with a lot of other establishments on the Island), but both the Lagoon Grill and Cantina seemed to be good values.They have the monorail and boat for transport to the various points in the hotel property, but we chose to mostly walk. According to my gps watch, it is about .25 miles from end to end.Our room was fully functional, nice and clean. We slept with the sliding door open so we could hear the surf. We didn't use the internet or the TV while we were there. There isn't a microwave, so leftovers or cooking doesn't work, but we didn't really want to do that in Hawaii anyways.We spent time snorkeling in the lagoon, which has lots of fish and turtles, though not quite the water clarity of some of the outside snorkeling hot spots. It is totally protected from the waves and currents, though. We also spent time in the pools or lounging beside one. There are at least three hot tubs as well spread around the pools. This trip we also ventured off property more than previous, and the conierges hooked us up with a nice uncrowded local beach within 10 minutes of the property.Wish we were still there!PS - not anything about the hotel, but try to avoid the Big Island during the Ironman if you aren't involved with it, as it brings lots of folks to the island and messes up traffic, rental car availability, etc... otherwise October is a \"between\" period with low people traffic. ", " We stayed at the Waikoloa Beach Marriott for 5 days and our AA flight was cancelled so they booked us a free night at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Too bad we didn't stay at the Hilton for the entire trip!! This is truly a 5 star hotel!! The hotel has a light rail train that stops IN THE LOBBY!! It has that Harry Potter feel!! You ride the train to other areas of the property. It has 5 stops I believe and is easy to find your way around & very ultra modern. We arrived late at night and didn't eat at the restaurants but we did have a breakfast buffet the next morning in the main area that we were directed to. The breakfast was awesome and I'm sure overpriced but it was compliments of American Airlines. Our room was very spacious, much larger than the rooms at the Marriott. Our room number was 3024 and it had a lanai that was open to a beautiful garden area. The room was very large with a comfortable king bed and the a/c was perfect. NO COMPLAINTS!! It was very quiet, did not hear any children or adults in our area. Explored the hotel the majority of the next day. It has a beautiful man made rock waterfall that you can walk under and take pictures as well as swimming areas that are plentiful. We enjoyed watching visitors swim with the dolphins & feed them while one of the employees filmed it. They housed 8 to 10 dolphins and two of them had babies a couple of weeks old with one dolphin expecting to deliver any day we were told. There is lots of asian art to look at and exotic African Crowned Cranes walking around that you can take pictures of. Spectacular view of the beach and ocean!! There is also a canal for boat rides that run beside the light rail train. Thanks to our cancelled flight we got to experience this magnificent hotel. If we ever go back to the Big Island, we will definately stay here!!! Loved it!!! ", " I frequent several of the hawaiian islands on business. After many of these trips by myself, I realized that I could not enjoy paradise without my wife. So now when I travel to the islands on business I take my wife so that at the very least, evenings are special occassions.Let me start by saying that I have 3 1/2 days of business and 3 1/2 days of pleasure planned on this trip. A sunday departure from DFW thru LAX to Kona. National rent a car (don't taxi unless you have to) and away we drove north to the KOHALA resort area. HIlton Waikola Village is the crown jewel in a series of resorts that stretch over the Kohala Beaches. Not only the largest in terms of rooms (3 towers and over 1200 rooms), but also the most scenic. Not that the other hotels in Waikola Village, Mauna Lani and Mauna Kea Resorts aren't nice, they simply aren't as big and don't have the attractions.Once we arrived at the hotel and our room we made immediate tracks for The Kamulea Provision Company (KPC), a fine dining restuarant located just 10 feet from the beach. A New Chef calls it home and he has a more varied menu than in the past. Island Fish is our preference and it was top notch. Overall we found that the island prices were reasonable and there were more than enough options with sufficient quality in the resort and in the local shopping areas to satisfy our palette.Overall the hotel is spread over 62 acres and is truly a multi-level wonder. Did I mention three towers (7 main buildings)? The towers are connected by a light rail train that runs end to end from 6AM to 12 PM. On the same level you can find the Canals that are traversed by boats that resemble Italian Launches. They run daily from 2PM to late and are a very romantic way to tour the resort. I recommend them the first night.We stayed in the Lagoon Tower. This tower is newly renovated and the rooms now sport modern fixtures in the bathrooms with upgraded countertops and very good furniture in the rooms. Alot of their business is in meetings so they have normal office style desks for those that must work while in paradise. I found this to be a perfect combination of workspace and comfort and give Hilton high marks on this inclusion in their remodel. If this is a factor in your stay, request a Lagoon Room when you make your reservation.Evenings were spent watching sunsets, then dining. Coffee and walsk aroudnthye resort. They have nightly entrtainment in the main building's lounge. Not just Island Sounds here. Real Music. Sports Bar. Great Drinks.Mornings were more walks. Check in the jumping fish, the sea turtles and the Dolphins.....Dolphin Quest: We were there when the newest of the THREE Dolphin pups was born on 10/17. Our room in the Lagoon Tower was situated such that we could watch the dolphins day and night. As a result much of our idle time was spent taking pictures of the three baby dolphins and wathcing them play There seems to be more availability to the Dolphin Quest Program than in years past. Kudos.Although my marks for Hilton Waikolao Village are very high, they are the same for the big island. 9 of the 11 temperate zones on the planet exist on this massive island. The mere experience of waking up and seeing the volcanoes is 'centering'.If you go ask the Concierge about the following:Kohala Spa!!!!!!! Get a massage. Guys ask for ROY he was incredible.Trips to the Observatories on Mauna Kea,Trips to Volcano National ParkHelicopter tours of the Volcanoes and Island. I hear that they have added a new trip that also goes around Maui's volcano.Waikola Luau - Top Notch, great food.Dolphin Quest- get your picture taken with the Dolphins! What amazing creatures.Take advantage of local Golf Courses (They are very easy to get on comnpared to other islands:I recommend Mauna Kea - Home of Big Three Golf, Mauna Lani South - Senior Skins Game and the Waikola Beach Course. All of these course play out to the Ocean and the views are breath taking. Take your wife even if she does not play!Soudn sliek I had a great BUSINESS TRIP! ", " WE loved this hotel. Big spacious rooms. Matress so comfortable we want to buy one at home. Gorgeous views of the ocean. It took us half an hour to walk from end to end on the property. It has two pools as well as a lagoon with snorkling to see the turtles and fish that come in from the ocean, rent boats to paddle, or just lay in the sand. There is an art gallery of Asian art to stroll by and multiple shops and a spa. Dolphin pool is close and it's fun to watch them frolic. For a fee, you can \"swim\" with them, which really means stand in one place and get to touch and feed them. Still, exciting to be so close these to magnificent animals. One of our party had concerns about the small space they seem to be confined to, but the dolphins seemed happy.We definitely plan on returning. All for a reasonable price for Waikoloa. I've stayed in rooms half the size for the same price in New York and Washington, DC. Why almost? The food is outrageously expensive. It's good but not excellent. The food at the Japanese restaurant was particulalry overpriced and overcooked. Breakfast buffet had good variety for the cost.However, there are multiple restaurants a mile away at varying prices so the cost of the food at the Hilton should not keep anyone from staying here. ", " Stayed here and was able to snorkel in the bay right on the Hilton grounds. I felt like I was in an aquarium. Turtles and so many species of fish! Huge property. Water ways and many pools. Private Adult only pool if you desire a bit of quiet time. Dolphin viewing and if you have the $$$ ( $200 for 30 minutes ) you can swim with them. ", " This is my first review of the Hilton Waikoloa Village even though I have stayed there at least three prior times. Had this been my first visit, I'd have given a \"Very Good\" overall rating instead of \"Excellent\", but considering how much I've enjoyed this place in the past, I will go with my overall average of multiple stays.From the time you go to check in, you see an expansive entry with both a walking path in both directions covered in fine art, as well as a monorail train, and a passenger boat all that leads to your rooms building. The rail runs every 7-10 minutes covering the entire length of the hotel. The boat might run a little less frequently, but not by much. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with flat screen TV's, high speed wired and wireless internet, electric safe and a balcony that has a small table and two chairs. There are several choices for your rooms view, and I prefer the Ocean Tower as opposed to the Garden or Lagoon. Still all are nice and seem to have the same dimensions/configuration. The resort is self contained meaning you never need to leave for anything you might desire. Of course there are a ton of things to do on the Big Island, and one can't miss is the observatory on Maunu Kea nearby. It is considered the best in the world and you certainly get above the clouds at 14,000' but I digress. The spa is top notch, the tennis courts are great along with a sunken stadium court with spectator seating. This is the first tournament that a young Andy Roddick won on the challenger circuit. They also have tennis racquet rentals along with group and private tennis lessons, but you need to play during the day because no light pollution is allowed due to the aforementioned observatory. There is a great pool of course, and also a saltwater lagoon where you can swim, snorkel, or ride on surface with a canoe. There are sea turtles swimming over at the waterfall, and you can get face to face with them. There is also a Dolphin Encounter in a separate lagoon where parents & kids can get up close in the water to pet the dolphins. This however is pricey, so you might want to steer the kids clear of Flipper & friends.Like any high end inclusive resort, the prices overall are not cheap. There are a variety of restaurants in the resort including Japanese, Chinese, Italian, etc., as well as places for lunch.I was a little disappointed with the Concierge this time around and made mention of it to the manager. Normally they have been top notch during my previous stays. I know several conventions were going on this time, but that is not going to cut it for regular customers staying and paying on their own dime. Hopefully my suggestion will be taken to heart, and the problem resolved during my next stay.Needless to say, if I am willing to return once again, I think very highly of the resort. ", " Yes, this resort is akin to a Disney vacation on the big island of Hawaii, but it was the perfect spot for our vacation to renew our vows. We were upgraded to a suite (which was huge!) in the Palace Tower. There was enough room for 2-3 families in just our suite, which also had 1 1/2 bathrooms. We were on the bottom floor, but we had two lanais that overlooked the front of the building where the tram and the boats ran to take people around the property. The room didn't get much use though as we were constantly out and about. The dolphin viewing pool was amazing, and we did the tot experience which was well worth the cost (I have a separate review for that experience). The lagoon was filled with sea turtles who were not afraid to swim very close to you as you snorkeled under the waterfall. Note that you are going to do a lot of walking even if you take the tram or the boat most places on this resort, and that's ok, this is Hawaii, just relax. Overall I'd bring our family back to this resort, we stayed two other locations on the Big Island during this trip, one was a house and the other was a condo in the Waikoloa area, and the Hilton blew the other two out of the water for location, amenities, and entertainment for our toddler. ", " We had been here once before when I was much younger and I wanted to return with my 5 year old daughter to see if she would like it as much as I did.Basically the answer was yes and the resort has maintained its amazing standards.We stayed in the beautiful Palace Tower and enjoyed the amazing artwork there and in the museum walk around the property.The rooms are very adequate 4-star business style. The only downside is that they are quite low on amenities and the coffee is putrid and, because of the coffee maker, you are restricted to the Hilton's swill of a brand that they offer. All of which is designed to get the captive audience out spending, I know, but we're going to do that anyway - it's only coffee, give us a break!Also worth noting for families travelling with young children, kids' TV such as Disney Jr is a PAY option on the TV.The resort facilities, as you would expect, are outstanding. The pools are spectacular and the lagoon, while a little murky when we visited, is a great place to snorkel with sea turtles and reef fish. The kids' club was very popular with our 5 year old who wanted to keep going back (at $65 per half day).The food at the resort has a range. The affordable options are not fabulous - you won't have a sensational dining experience here without being prepared to pay big bucks, but the Boat Landing Cantina did acceptable fare at a reasonable price.There is a good shopping market for food items at the Queen's Marketplace (about a 15 minute walk towards the highway) and Merriman's at the King's Shops is a great little alfresco eatery with good food at reasonable prices.The Hilton Waikoloa is a real experience, from the train to the boat to the giant staircases and elaborate art. It's an unforgettable experience in a truly beautiful part of the world. ", " this place is huge! it is also about 25 minutes away from kona and \"quaint\" shopping areas. however, the eateries are excellent and the two pools and the salt water lagoon are excellent. search around and you will find a good deal for a room.we had a great time! ", " The Lagoon Tower oceanfront had an amazing view and loved hearing the waves all night, the dolphins occassionally chattering, the birds... very Hawaiian. The bar even had great food. Jacques in catering was fantastic and made some great recommendations. Dawn (concierge) was very knowlegeable, front desk efficient. We did the dolphin encounter but just petting them for a photo wasn't what I had in mind. I wouldn't do this again. Great location away from the city and loved the drive. We were Fastbreak with Budget and got 1/2 price as a walk-up car rental special so we didn't make reservations. Call in advance to make sure they'll have availability and a 4x4 if you do Mauna Kea. Great stay and will go again! ", " Enjoyed my stay here, was a great location at the end of the road with views galore. The best Restaurant in the hotels many was the Japanese place a must dinning spot if you stay here !Hotel staff was great, clean room. If I had one thing to say bad is the hotel is extremely large, but they have a boat and a train to get you to where you are going.As a bouns they have a large lagoon that is fed by the ocean, pending the day lots of fish and other marine life come in. You can swim and snorkel here for free !I will be back again ! ", " My husband was here for a conference and I joined him for a few days. This is a fantastic resort. It is a beautiful resort. Drinks and food were pricey but on par for a resort of this type. The pool area was great. ", " I will not get into details, but I just want to register that this was the perfect resort for a fantastic visit to the Big Island. Although we spent most of our time outside the hotel (diving, doing the helicopter flight, etc) it was always great to come back and enjoy all they had to offer. We dove with the dolphins at their lagoon and this was one of the highlights of our entire time in Hawaii. If I have one piece of advice it would be: stay here, but rent a Jeep get out on the Island! ", " Just spent 3 beautiful nights here, and it is just fabulous!! The grounds are so beautiful, and all the wonderful art work is amazing. Food is quite pricey, but there is so much to do..love all the pools, and the lagoon is great..Would definitely go back!! ", " I have stayed at this resort 4 times. It is a beautiful resort with an open air lobby. After check-in you are wisked away to your tower by gondola or tram. There are tons of activities for the entire family. The spa is excellent with a real attention to detail. Several pools for the kids and a couple that are adult only if you are wanting a little peace and quiet. It is a bit expensive, but worth the money if you can afford it. ", " It has been many years since we stayed at this fabulous resort but the memories are fresh. We were awed by the setting and the amenities including trams and boats that take visitors around the property as well as open air hallways filled with beautiful objects d'art. We were at the resort for an incentive trip and found the meeting facilities, food and staff to be excellent. My wife was thrilled with her dolphin experience and dinner overlooking the sun set was incredibly romantic. I've read many of the more recent reviews and it seems that the property has retained all of the desirability that we recall. Enjoy! ", " Okay, there's not a lot that you can say negative about this Hilton. The setting is as beautiful as it gets. Snorkeling with turtles in the lagoon is a treat. The service is excellent.. but there are a few things worth knowing:1) The tram and boat are slow and it takes too much time between them, even if it is a \"shoulder\" season. Walking is a good option.2) if you're on the tram side of a building, the warning \"beep beep beep\" of the train crossings are very annoying. we were in 8003 in the Ocean Tower, right above a crossing, and it was a nuisance till midnight each night.3) Although a cool occurance, if you're in certain areas of Ocean or Lagoon Tower, the myna birds will get you up early in the morning.4) Restaurants are good but expensive on the property. I like Merrimans and Roy's at the King's Court (see my review on Roy's).5) I really think the Legends of the Pacific luau is worth skipping (see my review).6) Na Hoku really doesn't have sales, and the prices are the same at all locations, so you can't go wrong buying in Hawaii since the sales tax is lower than many mainland states.7) The hotel lagoon is a great place to snorkel and see fish and turtles.8) Dolphin Quest is a cool experience, but you can save a lot of money and live vicariously by having a great burger next to the lagoon and watching others pet the dolphins.9) Unless you like/want the exercise, self park can be a LONG walk to save $5 per day versus valet (they are very fast at getting your car when you valet park).10) I suppose nothing can be done about it, but I hate paying a $25 per day resort fee for many things that I never use. If possible, buy the internet only for $42 for the week.11) Have breakfast at Hawaiian Style Cafe in Waimea. Hard to find, but worth it for a great local breakfast. ", " The wife and I visited in mid-September. No kids, no crowds, kinda of a dead time, which created the stage for an absolute great time for us. The resort is HUGE with pretty much everything you would need. It's only 20 minutes or so from the airport, a few more minutes from downtown Kona where all the action is on 'that' side of the island. The place is an architectural masterpiece. The way they engineered the lagoons, the lansdscape... the way the ocean feeds into their lagoons, with the fish, and the turtles, it's just mind-blowing. It DOES kinda reminds me of Vegas, but that's not a negative to me. The only downside, there isn't a real beach. So if you're looking for a hotel/resort with long stretches of sandy beach area, this is not the one for you. But overall, we enjoyed it very much and plan on taking the kids and grandkids next year. ", " Last month I completed my sixth vacation stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island. Our family stayed seven nights this year. We stayed on points accumulated with my stays and AMEX affinity card points.The property is 30 minutes north of the Kona Airport, luckily car rentals are cheaper on this island than Maui, so be sure to have a car to drive the mile to the King's and Queen's shops and the 10 minutes to Waikoloa Village, where reasonable groceries can be purchased.The property is huge! There are three towers, all connected by a monorail and motor boats, much like the \"Jungle Cruise\" at Disneyland.Hilton recently renovated the Lagoon Tower rooms, and the rooms are beautiful! They appear to have done a major refit, changing the close, bathroom layout, wall coverings, etc. The rooms now have double vanities, a great closet as you enter the room and a larger bathtub and beautiful touches with a very subdued \"Hawaiian\" feel. The bedroom now has an outlet-friendly desk and an HDTV with a wide array of HD programming. All of the furniture is in a beautiful dark wood with a \u201cHawaiian\u201d touch.As a \u201cDiamond\u201d-level HHonors member for the past seven years, they\u2019ve upgraded me to this tower with a \u201cDolphin Quest\u201d view for four straight years. Thank you! This year I was on the fifth floor, and you can really see over the palm trees for an amazing ocean view!As a \u201cDiamond\u201d-level HHonors guest, they provide you with two $10 vouchers per day to use at any restaurant. Although I sorely miss the Diamond Concierge Lounge which closed in 2008, the coupons are actually more versatile. We used them primarily for lunch, with having breakfast off-property at the Starbucks in the Queen\u2019s Marketplace a mile away. They also sell a 7-day coupon for $30 with two $10 vouchers, making the net $10. It also provides a 10% discount on all food. I found their IT lacking as over 50% of the time they took off the vouchers before applying the discount. Luckily the front desk was able to adjust these each time. By the way, they offer a free meal to children 4 and under with a corresponding adult meal purchase.During this stay we were told the hotel was at 50% capacity, and it was wonderful!! Even when full on the last day there are always plenty of pool chairs to go around. I never felt any lines anywhere. They finally dropped their silly towel check-out, and now just provide pool towels by telling them your room number. Our favorite spot is the lagoon, a somewhat natural ocean-fed lagoon that is perfectly flat for our 4-year-old daughter to swim and use or rent water toys. We rented kayaks twice during the trip. As usual, the sea turtles were busy swimming the length of the lagoon.We did splurge one evening at the Kamuela Provision Company restaurant. This is the place to be for sunset. Even though they try to sell you a guaranteed patio package, we didn\u2019t have any problem to be seated on water\u2019s edge as the sun went down. They have rebranded their Boat Landing restaurant as a Cantina, and it was nice. The \u201cmake at your table\u201d guacamole dip is fantastic. We were disappointed with the food and service at the Dona and Toni\u2019s Pizza Restaurant. This is the third different theme in this spot along the boat waterway. The menu is confusing. I feel I was overcharged, but let it slide.They have a new Sundry Shop in the Lagoon Tower, but still everything is overpriced. I saw a really \u201ccool\u201d Hilton Waikoloa-branded cap on display but they wanted $32 for it. The Marriott in Maui had a Marriott property-branded similar cap in their sundry shop for $18.50. I almost bought it in spite. I don\u2019t think they get the idea of \u201cFree Advertising\u201d. Speaking of \u201cFree Advertising\u201d, stop by the Welcome Desk and pick up the free Hilton Grand Vacations tote. Ask for the green one! We use them for groceries here in California every week.This year we wasted 90 minutes to take the Timeshare tour, but when they got down to their \u201cSo what do you spend per year on vacation accommodations?\u201d pitch, they can\u2019t compete with ZERO as an answer. Thank you HHonors AMEX and hotel stays.If you really want to learn about the property, spend time talking to the boat operators. They are really the \u201cAmbassadors\u201d for the property. Not only do we remember them from year-to-year, they remember us too (it helps having out blonde daughter in tow). By far the best employee on the property is Boat Operator Kim. She really remembered us from our many stays and is the warmest, friendliest and most knowledgeable hotel employee you will ever encounter. I recommend killing an hour in the early evening just riding the full loop on the boat river. Make sure you wait for the convertible boats, if running.Other than lacking more \u201cHawaiiana\u201d atmosphere, the Hilton Waikoloa Village is where I\u2019d recommend anyone to bank every HHonors point they earn for an unforgettable vacation of a lifetime, or for me an annual pilgrimage. ", " we have stayed a few of times before, had great times, some things are expensive, but overall we really feel its great value, best time to go is not peak times, but go off peak, then you get really good value. Try to get inclusive breakfast, or early birds.(not the tweeting one,s some complain about)staff are great, and really helpful. hotel is not for everyone, but for our family, it is what we like. see the dolphins if you can. any problems , the staff are there to help, food is priced high, but its great, kids enjoy it, and they will do a deal for you, for the kids,. give the hotel a try, and you,ll be back, saunders family, ps get hilton credit card,well worth the price. ", " We arrived on the Big Island of Hawaii on the 25th of January 2013. We stayed in the town of Kailua our first night. On the morning of the 26th we went on a hike in Manuka natural reserve area. Our plan was to complete the hike then take off and check into the Hilton Waikoloa to begin a seven night stay. At the end of the hike my wife was hit in the head by a falling tree branch. The branch weighed over 100 pounds and caused my wife a number of injuries. After the branch fell we called 911 and had to have her taken to the local hospital where we stayed for the next three days. She ended up having a cut on the back of her head that required 30 stitches, two fractured vertebrae, a fractured scapula, and a fractured sternum ( it looks like she will make a full recovery). After our three day stay at the Kona Community Hospital we checked out and moved to the Hilton. This is when we were totally WOWED. When we got to the hotel the night manager was there to greet us. She had a wheel chair waiting for us and offered to push the wheel chair to our room. She had arranged for us to have complimentary valet parking and told us to call her if we had any other needs. She then gave us her cell phone number and told us to call her anytime day or night. She also suggested that we call periodically throughout our stay and let her know how things were going. In addition she arranged for us to have an upgraded room that was close to the elevator. She also put our friends in a room that was just two doors away from us. She was concerned that we might need help from our friend and want to make sure they were close. Once we got to the room we found that the house keeping staff had left extra towels, extra pillows and blankets, a supply of bottled water and a stool for use in the shower. The rooms in the lagoon tower have been recently remodel and are some of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in. Because of my wife\u2019s injuries we ate most of our meals at the hotel. The fish tacos at the boat bar were great. The Chinese food from Kirin was just what the doctor ordered (ha ha). I don\u2019t think you can find a better spot to watch the sun set than the Kamuela Provision Company (KPC) and the food is fantastic. This hotel did everything that they could to make our tip enjoyable. However I feel that they probably treat every guest with the same level of customer service. We plan on returning some day in the future. We feel confident that we won\u2019t have to worry about falling tree branches because the Hilton Waikoloa has beautifully maintained grounds. ", " We took 13 of us to this resort in Oct 2011. Ages varied from us the seniors, 30 year olds, 17 and 18 year olds and 7 and 8 year olds. It is hard to find someplace everyone can enjoy and this was it. We loved waiting for the trams, walking the resort, the golf, the water, the exploring. We were on vacation and had not time table. My children and grandchildren wanted to come back again this year, but we are all coming back in Oct. 2013. This resort is amazing and we just recommended it to a friend who is thrilled with what we told them. I give it 2 thumbs up or in the case of my family 26 thumbs up. ", " Excellent place to stay for families with children. This is a huge resort, which raises the only real criticism I can think of: if your room is in the Ocean Tower it can take 15 minutes to commute to breakfast, pools and the lagoon. That aside, we had a great time. The hotel restaurants are all very good and service was generally excellent. The bathroom in our room was very small but no other complaints at all. ", " We started our trip at our pre-booked hotel in Kona (Royal Kona Resort). After arriving and staying one night there, we had to leave as it was terrible. As soon as we pulled up to the Hilton, I couldn't take the smile off my face. Sooo much better. The grounds are huge and so beautiful, the rooms were clean and spacious and the staff all friendly. Many restaurants and bars, stunning pools, sea turtles and dolphins! I decided to see the wedding coordinator whilst there and now have plans on coming back in 2014 to get married. I cannot wait! I can't think of any negatives about this resort, other than the tram can be a little slow, but I just walked instead. Thanks for the great holiday! ", " My wife and I stayed here early Sept, 2012 for our 25th Anniversary. We researched this resort and it was everything we hoped for with few surprises. First this is a large, expansive resort. This is well documented. If you do not enjoy walking, have no desire to explore the amazing tropical grounds of this resort, lead a sedentary lifestyle, or are the type of person who would wait 10 minutes for an elevator rather than walk a single flight of stairs then this is NOT the resort for you. Having said that, the monorail (all day) and boat (starting at 2:00 PM) will essentially get you anyplace you need to go with very little waiting time or walking. BUT, things are spread out, and a little time and planning will help to get you where you want to be on time.As a Hilton Honors member, we were very well taken care. We got an upgraded room, $2x10 dining vouchers per day, free access to gym/spa, and 2 bottled water coupons. We found the entire staff to be friendly and helpful with no exceptions. Most didn't know we were Honors members.We stayed in the lagoon tower in a dolphin view room and loved it. I'm not sure we would have paid for the dolphin room but having gotten it as an upgrade, found it to be a great experience with a great view of the dolphins (shows, feeding, training) all day long. This room also had a great view of the lagoon and a partial (more than adequate) ocean view. These rooms are upgraded and very nice and spacious. You've read elsewhere, perhaps, about the Myna birds that nest near this tower. In my opinion they are quite loud and you WILL hear and notice them unless you've experienced significant hearing loss. They did not bother my wife and did not keep me from falling asleep but I did hear them more than once every night. This experience can be YouTubed. This is my only complaint about the Lagoon tower but would not keep me from staying there again.The resort has many restaurants, they are expensive but most things are in Hawaii. We ate at most of them and had no bad experiences and enjoyed nearly everyplace we ate. We planned ahead and either brought snacks or some items for breakfast or a light lunch (oatmeal, tuna, crackers etc) and didn't have to eat out three times every day. A little planning can save a lot of $$$. We also made a run to the market and got some additional items when we arrived (milk, fruit etc). If you eat out 3 times every day, it will be expensive...period. King and Queen's market are a 3/4 and 1 mile walk respectively and are accessible by bus for $2 each way per person for shopping and some dining (Starbucks, Macaroni Grill etc.) The gym/spa is very nice. Lots of equipment (though only one stationary bike) with a nice jacuzzi, steam room etc. Free for Hilton Honors else $20 a day (I think). The lagoon is amazing. Great, easy swimming with lots of ocean life to see. And the grounds are spectacular with beautiful, tropical landscaping and nice trails. There are two pool complexes, both very different in their layout. One near the lagoon tower and one near the ocean tower. Worth visiting both if you have the time. There is also an evening torch lighting ceremony in which a local runs through the entire complex lighting the numerous tiki torches which illuminate the resort after sunset. Overall, we really enjoyed this resort. Is it big...yes. Is it pricey...well it's typical for a really nice resort in Hawaii so plan ahead or choose another hotel/location. As for my wife and I, we'd come back here in a heart beat! ", " Awesome place. The hotel grounds are beautiful. They have everything, waterfalls, water slides, salt water snorkeling lagoon, beautiful walking paths even a mini golf course right by the ocean. The place is enormous, you can take a tram or a boat between buildings of the hotel. Very friendly staff. Would love to go back. Even the luau at the hotel was great with a very good buffet. ", " My fiance and I just spent 5 fabulous days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. This was my second time at this resort and I love staying here. As everyone has pointed out, this hotel is HUGE and very well kept. The tram and boat rides can be a little on the slow side, but who really cares, you are on vacation so why rush?! During the tram ride I enjoyed learning about the resort and animal life . We also did a lot of walking because the grounds are so beautiful we didn't mind the walks. Our room was located in the Ocean Tower which is the furthest tower from the main lobby. Since we were a couple on vacation, I really liked being away from the kids during down time. The rooms were very clean, but a little outdated BUT the ocean and pool view from our balcony was sooo amazing I couldn't be happier. The breakfast buffet was included in our vacation package and was pretty basic and OK, but honestly not worth $30/person if you have to pay out of pocket. Besides breakfast we didn't try any of the restaurants at the hotel. To save on money we would go to the Queen Market plaza located right outside of the resort and drove into Kona. Lots of options and very reasonable prices. Plus, if you're looking for an awesome snorkeling spot try Kahalu'u Beach which also located in Kona. Our hotel experience overall was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Some day when I have children I will definitely bring them to this hotel. I had the pleasure of speaking to some of the kids I met at the resort during our tram rides and they all said they were having such a fun time there. The only negative point I would like to point out is that the water in the jacuzzis looks very muggy and not very clean. ", " If you are looking for a resort that has everything, this is it. This was my 11th visit to Hawaii and first time on the Big Island. The Hilton Waikoloa is the nicest resort for families I have seen of all the islands. Nicer that the Kauai or Maui Hyatt properties in my opinion. It was the first time in Hawaii that I felt as though I didn\u2019t need a rental car because the resort had so much to offer.I get a kick out of the reviewers who complain about the size of this property. You don\u2019t \"need\" to take the tram. Walking around this property was one of the highlights and best memories of our trip. We stayed in the Ocean Tower which is furthest from the lobby and did not mind walking, even with a 7 year old. In addition to the monorail which comes every 10 minutes or so, you have two walking path options. You can take the walk along the beach (shortest) which is one of the most beautiful walks I have taken in Hawaii. We saw turtles EVERY time we took this walk, and even an eel once (and of course the dolphins). Your second option is the Museum Walk where you walk past artwork valued at $7 million. Most people would pay money to see this beautiful artwork, we got to admire it as we walked back to our room each night from dinner.I was prepared for the birds, but didn\u2019t hear anything the first or second night. On the third night, I got up early and heard faint sounds outside our room and realized that I had to open our room door to hear them. So either the sound proofing or the location of our room (6053) in the Ocean Tower made it a non-issue for us. (TIP: smart phones and tablets have sound machine apps that you can download for free pleasant sounds that can drown out ambient noises. I have used my white noise app in many hotels for street or other noises. However, I did not need it here).The hotel offers two day pass discounts that reduce costs on activities and other fees. One is $26 and the other is $39/day. Both come with free self parking and offer free ice cream, free miniature golf, two free drinks per day, and 50% off kayak, paddle board or other rentals. This really helps reduce the cost of these activities if you intend to use them. I think it is crazy to come to a place like this and not enjoy what it has to offer on site.Snorkeling and the other water activities are very fun and convenient. Not the best snorkeling on the island, but plenty of fish and turtles to see.We ate at four of the restaurants and liked all of them, especially KPC. The most romantic place we have had dinner, and probably the most expensive too. Yes, they are all expensive, but there are some menu options that are reasonable. For example, Kirin had dim sum appetizers in the afternoon for less than $5 each. The Pizza at Toni's was good ($22 for pepperoni, ouch!). Lagoon Spoon has cereal and breakfast sandwiches for $5. The shopping mall a mile away also has a food court if you really want to save.The Lagoon Tower improvements are finished and I saw no construction activity. All of the towers have nice ocean views and I would be willing to stay in any of them if I return. But the Lagoon Tower is the one close to everything. The room was larger than average and very comfortable. We had a king bed and our son stayed on the sofa bed, which is very convenient. 180 degree ocean and golf view from the north side of Ocean Tower. Could see the entire ocean lying in our bed.Family afternoon golf specials were really affordable with $25 adult rentals and free for kids!I know that the Big Island is known for its opportunity to explore and see the sights. If you intend to be adventurous and explore the entire island, then it probably doesn\u2019t matter much where you sleep at night. But I come to a resort like this for the opposite reason. I don\u2019t want to have to leave the property every day to have an adventure. We stayed on this property for 5 days and never got bored. Everyday, we felt like we were getting the best Hawaii has to offer and we didn\u2019t have to get into a car and drive anywhere. Thanks Hilton Waikoloa! ", " Gorgeous grounds! Like paradise! Pools huge and relaxing. Our room wa awesome, it was ground floor facing the ocean, so we could just open our balcony doors and walk out to see the sunsets. Loved this location!Restaurants all very good. Prepare for a long journey from your room to the lobby.Breakfast buffet good but of course Hawaii prices-expensive! ", " When you see the name Hilton, you know that always means quality. This hotel resort is so huge, that it takes a train, or a ride in a large boat to get you to your room! Every member of this hotel staff were the most kind and professional people that I've met, in some time. My husband is an amputee and requires a significant amount of assistance in his mobility needs. We brought his electric wheelchair, and they helped us unload and load his chair, as we needed. They also were gracious enough to waive their daily fee for parking our car, due to his disability. When we came and went at the hotel, there was an employee to assist him on and off the train with the ramp, leading onto the train. They were so kind and gracious to our family. The room was beautiful with a gorgeous ocean view. The grounds are immaculate. The many pools were always sparkling clean. It truly is, a once in a lifetime hotel to stay in and have every need, met 100%. ", " I visited this place 8 years ago with my family and was very impressed. I returned a couple of weeks ago to attend a conference and was able to combine my weekends to enjoy it. I booked a floor-level room facing the ocean in the Ocean Tower, where the sun set each night - a most awesome view - each sunset was unique and breathtaking!This place is huge! They have a tram and a small boat that can take you from one end of the property to the other. Families, especially children seem to enjoy the \"trip\" throughout the property.Once you get settled, you can enjoy many of the amenities they provide, such as their own private beach, the dolphin pool, many restaurants and activities. It is a great family venue!Parking lot is accessible, but requires a bit of a walk if you park your own vehicle. I do recommend valet service, unless you enjoy walking! ", " Although this is resort is enormous, that is definitely part of the charm. Spectacular location, and recently renovated rooms are absolutely top notch- oceanfront rooms are REALLY oceanfront rooms. Staff was very on top of things throughout the property, and Owana in the front office particularly professional and helpful with a last minute travel issue that was of my own doing. Has monorail, boat rides, enormous pool and fun slides; even if you are doing a Four Seasons stay, take your kids here for part of your Big Island stay and you will be their hero :) ", " Others have said it before: This is the largest resort in all of the Hawaiian Islands. Endless pools, activities, and food. Chinese restaurant extremely good and reasonably priced. Other restaurants are good to excellent but can be expensive. Don't pay $30-50 an hour to rent beach equipment. Go to the Sheraton next door on Tuesdays and Fridays for $25.00 all equipment all day long. Luau is exceptional good and a couple of hundred people. No buffet lines and a great show. Not cheap (get it with a package). Boat rides, tram rides get you around the complex. I throughly enjoyed this facility ", " I base a great deal of my expectations upon arrival. So while not terribly exciting as we turned into the drive it improved almost immediately. I had read several reviews in advance and had a minor thought that this was Hilton does Disney. And Disney actually knows how to do resorts. I figured there would be enough room on 26 acres that I would not be bothered by children (true) and getting around would be easy despite the silly review of some lazy person who complained about the wait for the tram (hint: walk- nothing is far). The disappointment was when we entered the room to find a Hilton room that could have been absolutely anywhere in the world. Nothing said Hawaii inside the room. Outside however everything grew on me day by day by day.I had a few minor issues with staff in restaurants and will describe them here. Also a few stupid smokers who could either not read or simply not abide by the rules. I must say that overall I would do this again in a heartbeat. Beautiful setting, easy access, enough room not to be bothered by dull people. One issue was having breakfast sitting at the Cantina in the Ocean Tower, you could hear the kitchen staff cussing loudly while children were present. I (who cusses) actually had to say something to the staff (IE stop it). Someone, presumably the head of the kitchen was a bit put off though did come out to apologize and said they spoke to the staff.The other issue was in ordering a draft beer from one of the pool bars and being overcharged. I said I will pay what the meny says to get the response that that meny was old. I said then take it off the bar. The bartender grabbed the meny and threw it to the side while complaining that they had no such key on the register! I then said \"not exactly my problem and I am not paying more than what it says in front of me\". You can picture the rest. I still tipped him well for fixing the issue but did not appreciate the attitude or throwing of the menu. The food is typically overpriced and so-so. The worst was Imari and I will post that in a separate review. Suffice to say something is wrong when after spending 70n for a light meal you need to go elsewhere since you are still hungry.I would absolutely go again and simply stock up on some snacks and alcohol from the local market. ", " This resort came highly recommended to us by friends and also locals we bumped into at the airport and car rental. Locals also take visitors for a day tour/stay to this place! So we were already happy with our choice! We had no idea it is soooo BIG though. Was shocked when they said they have a tram and a boat service but It's completely breath taking. Just spent 6 days in August 2012 as a family of 6 with 2 kids aged 4 and 8. We saw folks of all age groups here so this is not just a haven for families with kids. They have everything you could possibly want: lots of swimming pools, hot tubs and slides, a private lagoon and beach, dolphin quest, boat rides and train rides which my 4 yr old loved; water sports rentals, restaurants including Chinese, Mexican, Italian cuisines where vegetarians did not have trouble finding food, gorgeous waterfalls, beautiful gardens and flora (even fruit trees), fauna (dolphins, birds and turtles), shopping (for those who want to), spa (we didn\u2019t use), golf (didn\u2019t use)and mini golf, luau (didn\u2019t do), walkway museum (closed walk way that had beautiful artifacts from all over the world) and the list goes on. We spent 3 out of 6 days within the resort and enjoyed every bit of it and made sure we see every nook and corner of the resort. Two minor things for us were that housekeeping was not at its mark (although the rooms in Ocean tower were huge and beautiful) and the trains were too slow (even my 4 yr old mentioned it a few times). We paid for valet parking as we had a rental for all days. It wasn\u2019t much of a diff between 15$ self-pay and 21$ valet per day so we went for the latter \u2013 it\u2019s a vacation after all! Yes birds chirping in the ocean tower did annoy us a bit but doesn\u2019t impact the overall experience. We loved the breakfast buffet and the food at most of their restaurants even though they are expensive but given that it\u2019s a resort, which is expected. If we go back to Big Island, we will stay at this resort again without a doubt!! ", " This is a fantastic hotel on a massive scale. It has a monorail and water taxi to transport within the hotel grounds and boy do you need them. It is grand beyond belief with works of art , sculptures and artifacts from around the world. Fresh water pools, salt water lagoons and it's own Dolphinarium. All in all a brilliant hotel. ", " It's completely breathe taking. You can completely loose yourself here. They have everything you could possibly want. Lots of swimming pools. Restaurants include Kirin (best roast duck I ever had), a bar side grill that does rare burgers, and a Japanese restaurant that I did not have time for. Too many to choose from. ", " My family has now stayed twice at this beautiful resort. Views from the hotel room looking out onto the resort and the ocean are amazing! The resort has everything you need (restaurants, snorkeling, paddleboats, swimming pools, shows, etc.) to make Hawaii even more memorable. The price of food is quite high, but your surroundings wash it all away. ", " This was our 2nd time staying here. It is a beautiful hotel. The pool area is great. Lots of room and seats, you don't have to get up early to make sure you get a spot. The view outside the window was overlooking the front of the hotel not Oceanside but the room fit our family of 4 very well. The birds that roost in the trees at sunset and sunrise are rather nosy but they fly away in the morning so you don't have to hear them all morning. We jhad breakfast over looking the dolphin pool both mornings we were there. We enjoyed our time very much and would recommend it. ", " 3 generations of our family were enchanted by the close-up view of the dolphin pools from our well appointed rooms, directly above the pools.Grandsons loved swimming with the dolphins, snorkeling, and the superb pool and beach.We readily adapted to transportation by lagoon boat and/or tram throughout the resort...anothermarvelous experience.Food offered a range of kid-friendly abundant and inexpensive to resort fancy and expensive fare.Something for all budgets.Service was thoughful and pleasant. A great multi-generational family vacation place. ", " The Hilton Big Island (Waikoloa) is magnificent, it's spacious, with beautiful gardens and ocean views, a stunning pool / lagon for swimming in, with live sea turtles near by! I would recommend this resort to a variety of travelers, friends, families with kids and of course couples! A must see resort! Simply beautiful! Mahalo! ;) ", " Second stay at the Hilton Waikoloa resort and this time it was the staff that made it special. The new Private dinner boat rental was great. Our boat driver, Matt Bell, made it really fun and special. He went out of his way for us. The kids loved the hour boat ride and being able to get food from any of the restaurants was very convenient. Awana (sorry about spelling) was another hilton person who went above and beyond normal customer service to make our stay memorable. They made this visit even better than the first time. Saved money too by purchasing a weekly discount card. we got money back in coupons and 10% off at almost all the food places in the hotel. Little things like that made this time around better. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is massive! It contains three separate hotel units, an adult only pool, a system of five pools all connected by waterslides, and another huge pool with yet another water slide and three Jacuzzis! Oh yeah, and there's a ocean fed lagoon. Don't have enough water, walk down the shoreline path about a mile, and swim in A bay. There are several restaurants, but eat by 10, because everything is closed by then. There is also a mini putt course, several shops, a spa and a fitness club. But be prepares to spend a lot of money, for paradise is not cheap. There are two malls about a mile down the road you can take the shuttle to and stock up on some basic food items and eat at the food court. Overall it is worth every penny! ", " Older property with wonderful staff. Every person is friendly and smiles when you see them. Very hard to achieve. We have stayed here several times and will come back! Ocean Tower is the best area. Restaraunts are great especially one near Dolphins. ", " Read my previous review first. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60608-d89980-r76322941-Hilton_Waikoloa_Village-Waikoloa_Kohala_Coast_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.htmlI visit this property every year. My Aug 2012 trip allowed for me to see the newly refurbished Lagoon tower. The rooms are beautiful, very well done. I enjoyed the view of the Dolphins, the new fixtures and TV are excellent and the color scheme looks like something that will last a long time.The property remains one of my favorite places, I take my children there every year. This year the hotel was FULL, I mean, every room sold out. I went to the pools and there was still plenty of room to sit, plenty of swimming to be done, the lagoon even had open chairs during the peak of the day. This shows how well this property is run. I came from the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Oahu and they were full as well. Lines everywhere, no where to sit at the pool, craziness. Give me the Hilton Hawaiian Village, any day of the week. My only complaint is that in the Lagoon tower, you will be driven out of bed just before dawn by the birds that roost in the open area behind the rooms. I like to get up early and get to the Big Island Breakfast anyway but, you might not. ", " My wife and I went here for part of our trip to the Big Island. The resort is beautiful and very well maintained. Our rooms were clean and very adequate. The grounds and amenities here are really what makes this place unique. The lagoon area is really fun and even though we didn't have our kids with us, it would have been great for them. A very easy, safe place to snorkel, paddle board, etc. Lots of turtles, fish and even a couple of eels in the lagoon that were fun to swim with. Even though this resort doesn't have a beach right on property, this lagoon more than makes up for it. Really fun. The pools are big and very freshing with fun water slides and waterfalls. I read other reviews about this resort prior to booking and many had complaints about the slowness of the resort monorail/tram that runs from one end to the other. They had two trains running while we were there, and while the wait was a little longer than we would have liked, you can still walk between everything. I wasn't dragging my three kids along with me, but I don't think it would have been a problem. The boats run in a canal along the same path as the tram and are really fun. It is like a mini Jungle Cruise.I would say this hotel is definitely a family hotel more so than a couples retreat. But still very fun. ", " This Hilton is very large and really seems like a village. There are 3 large towers - Lagoon, Ocean and Palace. We stayed in the newly renovated Lagoon Tower and the rooms were fabulous. I recommend this tower. There was a lot of space, double sinks, a small fridge for leftovers and bottled drinks and a small balcony they call a lanai in Hawaii. It was also close to the lagoon that you could stand up paddle, snorkle and do other fun stuff. The best part about this place is the ability to see sea turtles! They seem to gravitate to this lagoon and can easily be seen by the most novice snorkler and swimmer. They are graceful and awesome. The food choices here are pretty good also. There is lots of shopping and did I mention the dolphins??!! There is a Dolphin Quest where you can get in the water with dolphins and their trainers like in Discovery Cove in Disney. There is not much beach here to speak of - just a rocky area where you can walk with shoes. No sand at all. The views are divine. We recommend buying the Ohana pass which allow you to unlimited soda, 50% off on some items, free daily ice cream, etc. The grounds here are quite lush and peaceful There are statuary and artifacts from Pacific island culture. I felt the grounds were tops and zen-like. The place is very large and there is even a boat and tram to get you from one end to the other. We used it only the first day, but little kids will love it. As usual, everyone is super friendly and laid back - Hawaiian style. We loved it and felt it was more soul-full than Maui. ", " This hotel was just wonderful. Very large resort, but easy to get around with the tram and the boats. Rooms were large and spacious with fridges and seperate shower and dressing table. I really appreciated the number of swimming pools, especially the adults only. Even in the large pools, you never felt crowded with alot of guests in the pool. Excellent poolside service, comfortable cabanas, great breakfast buffet, extremely helpful staff and very enjoyable luau. Only thing that wasn't excellent was the dinner we had at the Boat Landing. Really overpriced for mediocre bar food. This is a resort I would definately visit again. ", " The resort was simply amazing. My son even rated it as \"excellent\" . We enjoyed our stay. The room was kept clean everyday and it was big enough for a family of 4. I loved the mini shampoo, conditioner and lotion that they provided. I do not usually use those small stuff because we usually bring our supplies but this time I could not resist. It's really a resort fo the whole family, It's a place you can't stop taking pictures. My childern enjoyed swimming with the fishes and turtles at the Lagoon. Also, snorkling and kayaking. Lots of fun stuff. Staff was super friendly. Located near shops, restaurants and of course. an ABC store. Will recommend. Rooms or tower location was not an issue for us because there was a tram or a boat that brought us back and forth to the lobby and other areas of the resort. ", " We've now stayed at this resort twice over the past 3 years and continue to be impressed by all that it offers for a very reasonable cost. The resort is lush and tropical and very extensive. While it is located on the shore, it does not have a formal beach on the ocean, but an inland lagoon which is very nice. Numerous restaurant alternatives were great, always good food and good service, and the pool options were extensive. Granted, it is a huge complex and during busy parts of the day the trams were pretty full or the boats (yes, you can take a boat to your room building!) were packed. A small price to pay for a wonderful place on a remarkable island. ", " The resort is huge, about 30 minutes to walk the total length. The pool complex is wonderful, which includes a fresh water lake that you can swim with sea turtles and fish. There is no direct beach access but there is a path that you can walk to the beach or the resort will provide van service over to it. The resort does offer a swim with dolphins. Clean rooms. Buffet breakfast is amazing. Wonderful resort and a great value. Go if you can. A short walk along a nice walking path and you will find lots of places to eat outside the resort ", " We had 3-family vacation at the Waikoloa Village in July 2012. My husband and I had stayed there about 15 years ago and had wonderful memories of the beautiful artwork, spectacular landscaping and very comfortable rooms. We felt it would be a perfect spot for our grandchildren to experience Hawaii for the first time. We were not disappointed. Grandkids ranging from 4 to 15 had a blast at the pools, on the slides, renting the water toys in the lagoon and, most of all, swimming with the dolphins. The service was excellent and accommodations in the Lagoon Tower were perfect (just reopened after renovations). We also took advantage of the restaurants on property, including the Japanese restaurant where we enjoyed the antics of the chef who cooked for us at the table and entertained all the kids. Only thing I would recommend is that the resort have a few more dining options. There was only one casual restaurant and one casual breakfast place on our side of the resort. These were often crowded. On our last day we checked out on time but had a late flight. Hilton let us use \"hospitality rooms\" for 45 minutes at no charge before we left. Nice touch to be able to shower before heading to the airport. Highly recommend! ", " Our family of four stayed here for just four short days in August, 2012 and had a wonderful time. In fact, we wished we had stayed for a week. Check in at 7pm was effortless and quick. Since we were Diamond members, we received two $10 coupons per day for almost any food and beverage outlet on property as well as a coupon for a bottle of water for each person in our party. Bell services took our luggage and delivered it to our room quickly. Don't even think of trying to load it on the tram like we saw someone else do. The property is very spread out and while the rooms are a lovely 5-8 minute stroll from the lobby, attempting to negotiate luggage will quickly make you forget you are on vacation. We enjoyed walking the property though the tram was good to have when tired. Our room was in the middle of the Ocean Tower and was spacious and very clean with a great view of the lagoon (could see the ocean too). I recommend trying an \"e-upgrade\" if possible or just booking a dedicated one bedroom. Newly renovated with a pull out queen sleeper bed and a large dining table, this suite made our vacation relaxing instead of all of us cramming into one room. We enjoyed getting up at 5am and letting the kids sleep in without disturbing them. A roll away was delivered shortly after check in and there was ample room in the living room to accomodate it. Beds were very comfortable with a good selection of pillows. The suite had a refrigertator but no microwave. Coffee maker (which broke but was replaced) and no-name supplies were just fair. The Waikoloa Coffee Company a short walk down by the lobby charges $4.50 for a small and $5 for a large, decent cup of coffee. We ate dinner a couple of times on property and Dona and Toni's pizza was delicious with a whole wheat crust. They charged us for four toppings,(about $17) when we ordered them on just half the pizza. Salad and parmesean breadsticks were fresh and tasty and ordered dessert (a fresh baked cookie with ice cream....very yum). Service was efficient and friendly. Recommend trying to sit outside on the patio or if there is a long wait by the big glass doors/windows that can open onto the patio.The lagoon was clean and clear. Kids rented a small canoe and tooled around and found large sea turtles. Lounge chairs were tough to come by so get there early. Beach service for drinks was a bit spotty. Pools were not too crowded and were well kept. Beautiful views are plentiful and pictures always seem to look better with the Pacific Ocean in them. All in all, it was a fantastic stay (thanks to our one bedroom suite) and we wished we had booked longer. ", " We completed a self drive around Big Island with family of four finished our stay at the Hilton at the spare of the moment and we were impressed, yes the resort is large but thats what makes it charming we stayed at the palace towe hotel in the middle of the resort and found it the best location right in the middle of everything and the rooms very awesome, i have read some bad reviews and really dont understand how anyone could say bad things about the resort? listen to the book in clerks directions to your room to stop any confussion and stopping at wrong hotel and expect costly meals you are at a 5 star resort but the cafe near the dolfins in good for prices, spend the time snorkling in the lagoon because there are turtles in there you just need to be patient they are usually near the waterfall, we went in the high season and didnt find the pools or lagoon that busy enjoy your holiday Aloha ", " This place is amazing! My husband and I visited a few months ago and I am dying to go back! It was beautiful and very romantic. We were staying in the Palace tower in the middle of the resort. We had a great view of the mountains and the golf course. I loved eating at the Lagoon Grill because it overlooked the dolphins enclosure and the waterfall at the lagoon. I was also recommended by a very helpful hotel worker named Ammy to eat at a romantic japanese restaurant called Imari. It was perfect! I also got to swim with the dolphins in the Dolphin Quest program. It was expensive but a once in a lifetime experience! I have told all of my friends and family that it was the best resort ive been to and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great vacation! Thanks Hilton!!! ", " Spent my honeymoon on this hotel and the experience surpassed all expectations. First surprise was when I asked how do I get to my room: a monorail stops inside the lobby!! Never saw this in my life before. Then walking around the place, find a pool with dolphins!!! And then swimming in the lagoon I find myself with big green turtles swimming next to me. There were so many details that made this stay so nice. Watching the sunset on the cabanas is simply breathtaking. We also experienced the marvelous sunset dinner at the KPC: food was excellent and the sunset view fantastic. In general the service was very good by all staff at the hotel.Recommend attending the welcome speech, very good tips were provided, at same speech we got an invitation to a 2hr timeshare presentation: standard timeshare talk, didn't sign anything and just for attending we got a Holo card that gave us 140$ discount on helicopter ride and 100$ that can be used at any expense at the hotel (I got this 100$ certificate after I did checkout, went to the counter to see if I still could use them, and the attendant did reopen my bill and gave me the 100$ credit on the bill and gave me the 100$ in cash, what a nice service!!).The hotel is located on a nice bay, and the is an excellent view of the sea and the rocks from the pools and common areas. We enjoyed a lot the design and location of the pools.If you plan to have some meals in the hotel, recommend buying the hotel discount card, costs 20$ and gives you 10% discount on any meal, pays for itself right at the first use.Some negative items:Food is expensive but you can drive 5 mins out to cheaper restaurants in the area. The rooms could benefit from a overhaul, they looked old.The service at business center was not good, went there to print my boarding pass and the attendant was not very friendly.Self Parking is far, so be ready to walk.I definitely plan to come back!!! Best vacation of my whole life!!! ", " My father lives in Hawaii so we go visit every couple of years. Each visit we make sure to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. From the tram and boats in the lobby to the dolphin pools to the two glorious pool experiences (one with waterfalls and a very large water slide, the other an acre long with smaller slides along the way) it's a tropical amusement park of a resort. the 5 \u201d towers\u201d of rooms are spread across a huge piece of property, the reason for the trams and boats. If you choose to walk, the way is lined with art of all kinds. this hotel opened when I was 11 or 12 and captured my heart. It has since done the same for my husband and my children. Even if you don't stay here, if you're on the big island, go check it out! You can even buy a day pass for the pools if you're so inclined. ", " The grounds of the hotel are amazing and beautiful. The staff kept everything in tip-top shape and everybody we came in contact with from the hotel were nice, friendly and willing to help with anything. We were comfortable in the spacious and clean room and enjoyed the acres of pools and lagoon. It was located in the middle of all the day trips we planned so nothing was all that far to drive to. It was an amazing way to end our 5 days on the Big Island. I would love to go back to this resort in the future. ", " I travel for a living spending 100+ nights a year in hotels around the world and have been in everything from the Ritz Carlton's and Shangri-La's in Asia. First this is a top quality place and they do a job trying to keep the place well maintained, property and gardens. The service was exceptional and the food was great too among the number of themed restaurants on the property. It's a great jumping off point for touring the big Island with the exception of the volcanoe's on the far side of the island, nothing is too far for a 1/2 day trip. The best part is that you really don't need to go anywhere to enjoy yourself immensely. It is so beautiful there and activities and ammenities are everywhere within the resort. While many complain of the children, you can find quite time and private time away from them, most of the time. My wife and I didn't take any kids but knew that they would be around and had no difficulty with noise from either the kids or the birds. And the whale watching from the waterfront seats was phenomenal! Enjoy!!! ", " I enjoyed our recent family trip to this resort in July 2012. This was my first trip to Hawaii and this was the perfect choice. The rooms are large. We were in the newly refurbished Lagoon Tower (completed the previous week). We had 2 queen beds. The room is very nice and spacious. You do not feel cramped. The walls are thick and I did not hear any noise from other rooms. We had a nice view of the dolphin pool. The grounds of the hotel are very beautiful. It is filled with amazing artwork. The resort is large so there is a lot of walking involved. My boys loved the lagoon and the rentals that are offered (I would suggest the Fun Pass. At $27/day it is a must if you want room internet, are parking a car and would like to rent toys in the lagoon.) The staff is very friendly and accomodating. The lagoon pool is great for families. The only negative thing is that the pool frequently ran out of towels. The restaurants were good although somewhat expensive. There are many restaurant options especially for dinner if you do not want to leave. I would highly recommend this property. ", " Spent 7 nights at this premier Hilton property, where they take good care of their guests. Lives up to its Hilton name. Excellent restaurants on site. Friendly staff. Beautiful \"museum walk\" at this sprawling 66 acre property. Fortunately, the trains and water taxis make it a bit easier to navigate, but we often chose not to wait for the transit, instead, opting to stroll down the lengthy museum-like walkways between the various hotel towers. Do try the \"Big Island Breakfast\" buffet some time during your stay. All the standard breakfast items with an island touch, and made-to-order pancakes and waffles, but you have to ask your server. They also have the asian foods buffet (miso soup, rice, fish, etc), and fresh fruit. No natural beach on site, but a beautiful man-made lagoon with access to the ocean (go at your own risk), if you like to snorkel. So many beautiful fish, sea turtles. If you do want a beach, \"A-Bay\" is a two minute drive/10 minute walk away. Also, many beautiful beaches are within 15 minutes (drive). ", " We bought a package deal for 7 days. Right before we left my friend died. Too late to change so we went ahead with our plans. We explained this to the girl at the check-in, her name is Bianca and she went out of her way to get us settled in a beautiful room. The view was gorgeous, the rest of the staff were really nice to us. Very clean, everything we needed and we felt some better. Thanks to everyone !!!! ", " We were greeted like family after traveling 21 hours to reach this amazing hotel/complex. The rooms were spacious and delightful. The foods I every restaurant was outstanding and the service from all was attentive without beingg obtrusive. We were there 6 days and I wish it could have been more. We will definitely return to this lovely paradise if the opportunity provides. ", " We stayed here for a week. Had a great time. The views are great. We loved walking the grounds and then also walking along the Ocean. Loved the walk to the Marriott Beach along the beach. Food was a little pricey, but then there were food options near the hotel, along with the Island Gourmet Grocery store to get items. After a few days we did get tired of waiting for the Tram, and would walk if it wasn't close. The Discover Hawaii desk folks were great in giving us ideas for day trips from the Hotel. We went to Manua Kea and Volcanoes National Park.We would certainly come back to this Hotel on our next stay. ", " Beautiful hotel with many activities for our teenage kids. We just returned- stayed in the Palace Tower on the 7th floor. Amazing room with a walk-in closet. We had the king size bed, pull out sofa & a rollaway bed and still had plenty of room. Very well maintained property. We took the monorail and boat everywhere. Great lagoon with lots of activiites- kayak, surfboard, floating bike rentals. ", " We loved our stay here. We stayed in the palace tower which was not ideal all the other towers are better locations but we were stuck in the middle and our boat dock was under construction during our stay. I loved walking the grounds in the morning and swimming in the lagoons followed by a dip in both pools. Our kids 12 and 14 loved the pools. The lagoons have turtles and a wide variety of fish plus they sunk marble slabs with pictures and descriptions of the fish in the lagoon. We ventured off property every day usually in the afternoon and evening. It is doable to drive to volcano but will definitely be an all day trip since it is two hours away. Kailua kona is only 30 minutes away. Definitely stop at Target or Costco only 3 miles south of the airport before you head to towards the hotel. The selection there is much better and a way better value for your money. Get breakfast foods and drinks there since on property it is super expensive. ", " We loved it at Hilton Waikoloa, there was so much to do and see, pools and slides were awesome for the kids, they loved the dolphins. It did take a while to get around the place as it was so large but the monorail is very frequent. After we left we realised that our young daughter had left her security teddy that she sleeps with every night. We rang them immediately and they advised us that they had it and that they would send it back to Australia for us. When we got it we noticed that the postage was $36 and they never even asked us to pay for it. Pretty exceptional service ", " Very large resort, we were there for our honeymoon & had a great time. If you want quiet time, you can find it, if you like family pool time, you can find it. Absolutely beautiful grounds & area. Would recommend \" inclusive\" meal plan. Definitely comes in handy for 2 people. Over all, we had a fantastic time !!! Highly recommended !! ", " Amazing hotel which had fantastic facilities making it a 5 star all round in my rankings.There are pools with dolphins you can see and watch without having to pay the fee to work with them close-up. There are large sea turtles in the main pool lagoon you can swim alongside and watch them eat and swim about. There is an electric tram and a canal boat to carry guests through the resort complex. There are a large choice of restaurants including a chinese, japanese, mexican and pizza restaurant along with a pool bar area and a more exclusive smart dress restaurant of varying price ranges.This ranks alongside a superb resort hotel I stayed in in southern Turkey as a true 5 star complex. Book this one if going to the Big Island! ", " My family of four (two adults plus two kids, ages 9 and 11), just spent a week here. We had a wonderful time. Based on the reviews here, I was prepared to hike forever to get from one end of this hotel to the other. That was not the case. In fact, I'm surprised at how many people complain about this! We walked for no more than 7-10 minutes max, ever. If you've ever stayed at enormous hotels like the Fontainebleau in South Beach (Miami) or the Aria Las Vegas, this hotel is not considered large or spread-out by any stretch of the imagination. It took us 5-7 minutes to walk from the main reception area to our room in the Palace Tower. It took maybe 8 minutes to walk from the Palace Tower to the Kona Pool and the Lagoon. It was 5 minutes walk to the Kohala Pool. I just don't get what all the fuss is about. There are trams and boat taxis if you can't or don't want to walk, and digital displays at each stop tell you how many minutes until the next one comes, so you can easily decide if you want to wait for it or just walk. The grounds are gorgeous and the ocean is within view, plus there are cool breezes and warm sun... I just don't see what is bad about strolling along (so long as you're physically able.) The claims of it taking 20 minutes to get from place to place are just not true if you're a healthy person fully able to walk. The self-parking was also much closer than I thought, based on what people said here. We were at our car within 12 minutes of leaving our room. The loud, chatty mynah birds are in the Ocean Tower so we opted for the Palace Tower instead. We were on the top floor and had a partial ocean view. It was quiet and just beautiful. One morning at 4:30 a.m. I did hear the birds in the distance from over at the Ocean Tower, so I just closed our balcony door. Problem solved. The tips here on TripAdvisor about the food were very helpful to us, as the food on-site is expensive. Upon arrival, we stopped at Walmart and bought a $20 coffeemaker, some Kona coffee, creamer and stevia, plus granola bars, peanut butter, honey, bread, and lots of fruit. We had breakfast in our room each morning. The room's mini-fridge is not super cold, so we kept our container of coffee creamer on ice in the ice bucket. We saved a bundle and got to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in our room for very cheap. We opted for the Ohana Fun Pass, at $39 per day, which gave us free self-parking ($15 daily value) and free ice cream for four every day ($24 daily value), which means it paid for itself with those two things alone. Plus, we each got a souvenir dolphin cup and bottomless soda/iced tea/lemonade refills all day long; 50% off all rentals at the Lagoon, and we rented EVERYTHING: hydrobike, kayak for three, stand-up paddle board, and snorkel gear, several times over; my 9yo did the Dolphin Quest (which she LOVED) and we got two free 5x7 photos of her with the dolphin, also free; we would have also gotten a free round of put-put golf and half-off tennis, but we didn't use those services; and my husband did use the fitness center for free as well. I highly recommend getting the Fun Pass. (There's a lower priced one, the Aloha Fun Pass, for $27 per day which could make more sense if you're traveling as a couple or with just one child).We found the service to be excellent. Our bags arrived at our room within 10 minutes or our arrival to the room, and the bellman came to get them at the end of our trip within 10 minutes of our calling. Every staff member said good morning and \"aloha\" to us all the time. Everyone we spoke to was very helpful and polite. We had great drink and food service at both of the pools, too. Everyone is great about giving you tips and recommendations for where to go, where to eat, etc.We ate lunch at the Orchid Marketplace near the Kona Pool most days, and it was about $40 to $47 each day for four people. That's what we'd spend on lunch at a place like Chili's back home, so it wasn't outrageous to us at all. We did not dine on-site for dinner at all. We ate at Roy's (nearby), Merriman Market Cafe (nearby), Lava Lava Beach Club at the Marriott next door, Humpy's in Kona (we spent a day down there), and at Hau Tree at the Mauna Kea Resort (just up the road from the Hilton about 5-10 mins drive). Roy's and Hau Tree were both excellent. Lava Lava is very new and the service was slow, food was so-so, but the beachside location was great. We also did the luau one night, which was fun.To start our day in Kona, we had breakfast at Big Island Grill, which was a hot and robust meal, and very good. We also had lunch at Huggo's on the Rocks in Kona, which was great and a really popular place where you sit with your toes in the sand. As for activities, we went ziplining through Big Island Eco Adventures in Havi, about an hour north of the hotel, and horseback riding at Paniolo Ranch also in Havi. Both were wonderful. We did a snorkeling cruise through Fairwinds in Keahoe, down to the bay south of there, and it was also terrific. We spent a day at Hapuna State Beach and were able to rent chairs, an umbrella and snorkel gear. They DO NOT rent towels, we learned, so be sure to bring some down from the Hilton if you didn't pack any in your suitcase. Hapuna Beach is simply beautiful with white sand and real waves. We had a lot of fun there. The only drawback of this hotel for us was the lack of a beach. The entire Kohala Coast is mostly lava rock, so none of the hotels have great beach access. The Marriott has a small beach. The Fairmont Orchid has a man-made lagoon that opens out to the ocean (whereas Hilton's lagoon does not). The Mauna Kea has its own beach and it's gorgeous. So if you want to step right out onto the sand from your hotel, you do have other options in the area besides the Hilton.My biggest tip for folks who plan to snorkel is to bring your own gear from home or buy your gear at the Walmart in Kona or at the Island Market located in the King's Shops. For $12 to $15 per set, you'll be set for your trip and be able to use it whenever you want. We rented ours at the Lagoon each day, and then again at the beach, and spent far more doing that than if we had just bought our own gear. All in all, this is a fantastic property for families with children, with loads of things to do, gorgeous Asian artwork, plenty of food, shopping and spa options, and it's close to other things if you want to venture off-site and explore the rest of the Kohala Coast and Kona. ", " Great saltwater pool with turtles and fish beautiful grounds. Room was a bit outdated but no complaints. Staff were very helpful especially upon check in. This is a very large resort and has a train and boats to get around great place to stay with children. ", " If you have young children who love to swim this is the hotel for you! We were very fortunate to spend 5 nights at the Hilton Waikaloa. My husband is a diamond member and they upgraded us to a gorgeous room in the ocean tower. We were in a room across from the adult pool and it wasn't a direct ocean view, but it was good enough for us with a pretty view of the golf course with some ocean in the distance. We signed up for the \"fun pass\" I think it's called where you get cute souvenir cups with bottomless soda each day for 4, free ice cream, access to the beautiful Kohala spa, and much more. Let me tell you, as soon as we boarded the tram to take us to our tower our little girl let out a scream of joy as we were passing the sights along the way. That alone says it all for us. There are so many pools to choose from as well as plenty of seating for everyone. One of our children lost her fear do swimming without a floaty during our stay here and is now swimming all on her own. Their favorite pool was the one with the small slide and the sand bottom pool. The only little complaint is that there should be more than one hot tub on the entire property and it would be great over at the adult only pool. Our kids loved the buffet and so did I. Otherwise we had food from Costco and ate at the Cantina only once. My recommendation there would be to make the dinners come with rice and beans automatically which I assumed they did, but everything was ala carte. I recommend the grocery store at Islands market in the Mauni Lani shops, for rice and chicken and other reasonably priced food. My favorite part of this hotel is the stunning ocean trail that you can take along the golf course. I only got to walk it once, but I will never forget it. Go to Buddha Point to watch the sunset. It is amazing. Oh, I almost forgot rent a paddle boat out at the lagoon and look for sea turtles. One more thing, get your picture taken with Marly the cute parrot or just find the photographers out at the pools or sunset and take home a priceless memory. Our girls don't know we bought their pictures even though they kept begging us to do so. My plan is to give it to them for their birthdays. We also want to take a moment to personally thank Freida at the front desk. We had to cut our trip short at the last minute, but she was very nice to my husband and later to me over the phone. She is very gracious and professional. Thank you also to Milagros, the lady who cleaned our room each day. She did a wonderful job in keeping our room beautiful and putting all the pillow pets nicely together with a Hawaiian flower much to the delight of our girls. One more thank you to Christian out front at valet for his genuine friendliness and loves the SF Giants like my husband. Thank you Hilton Waikaloa for an unforgettable trip for our family! ", " This hotel on the West side of the Big Island of Hawaii is more than just a hotel. It is an experience all of its own.There are three actual hotels on the property, each is difference and decorated outstandingly. The rooms are very comfortable with views of either the water of mountains. Wonderful sheets, ammenities, Hawaiian Coffee, soft towels, reading materials, and just Royal comfort.The surroundings are absolutely beautiful - very local and host warming.The outside ammenities are overwhelming - restaurants (first class), shopping, boat rides, tram trensports, a museum, art galleries, boat landing, several pools, a small zoo, Keiki (children) Club, several ballrooms, Spa, lagoon, and much more.You experience in this hotel will be a memory of a lifetime. ", " Love this hotel, not only is it beautiful, so much for kids and parents to do. Your gonna have a trip that will be so memorable. Don't forget to book your Dolphin adventure before you go, they bookup fast. I have done it four different times and love it! Aloha ", " The train, boat, dolphin swim, scuba+snuba and snorkel activities on the Hilton grounds will win over any family looking for a safe and diversified vacation.We were able to take the shuttle boat to dinner and various activity destinations and train back to our hotel rooms. The kids enjoyed the snorkel at the lagoon with its own beachside. The dolphin swim was one of the highlights of our stay. If you are focused on activites and want some fine dining as well, Hilton Waikoloa is a great place. My tip for dining: Kirin Chinese Restaurant...The taro shrimp, Pekingese scallop or the wuxi (wooshi) pork ribs were my fav...don't miss breakfast at Water's Edge...(buffet and ala carte), aaaaannnnnd GREAT views ! ", " This was an awesome hotel stay when I went with my family. It was a great hotel, massive pools, great scenery and right by the ocean. It was very nice, I loved this hotel, it was great. However the thing that was most irritating was when I had heavy luggage and we were waiting for the trams it took forever so my mother insisted on walking and I think I almost killed myself. If the trams were a little faster it would have been perfect but other than that I would return back to this hotel. I am going to go again this August, if you go to the big island of Hawaii then I suggest you go to this hotel, you will not be disappointed. ", " We decided to celebrate my 60th birthday with a week at Hilton Waikola. Village. This is our 3rd trip to the Big Island and 2nd to this resort. We have been HH Gold for over 10 years and were upgraded to a Palace Suite on the 5th floor. Everything has been spectacular and many thanks to Stefan for all the help. The suite is 1700 sq ft with 5 lania's and 2 bathrooms.As far as complaints about the pool temp it really is not that cold. Getting in is a little brisk but we were immediately comfortable. The lagoon is very clear with huge turtles, eels and loads of fish. Finding seats at the lagoon was easy. We were also able to get 6 lounge chairs together at both pools without problems. Housekeeping prepared an aloha on the bed spelled out with pebbles and orchids.We purchased the 29.00 discount pack and our dinner bill was 10.00 for 2.There is a lot of walking but it is great excersize and beautiful grounds.Imari and KPC are both excellant and expect to pay 40 to 50 dollars for a great dinner. I already have plans for the double lamb chops at KPC for 42 dollars.The staff has all been friendly and helpful. Checking took about 5 minutes.I am handicapped so we chose valet parking which is free with a handicap placard.We are here for the rest of the week and are looking forward to the turtle release at Muana Lani on the 4th. ", " Last stop spent a week here grounds gorgeous, stayed in Palace Tower rooms are nice but need updating which they are in process of doing .They started with the Lagoon Tower, The Lagoon simply amazing two daughters 17 and 6 loved every minute of this place,would definetly stay here again. ", " For a detailed review, check out my previous stay. All things still apply. With this stay, we were with a family of 16, for my parent's 40th anniversary. It was perfect for the large party. If you have kids this is the place to stay. It was a great time. We spent one whole day just at the pools and having our every need taken care of by a great friendly waitress! I increased my rating to a 5 for improved service, and with the perspective of traveling with children. ", " We absolutely adored our stay at this fine property in Kona, Hawaii. It could not have been any better. Grand from the check in process to the stay. You go to your room in a boat or train and they bring the luggage magically. It is full of all the resort style activities and even has activities that you would not expect. The rooms are great, the stay was wonderful and one that we will never forget in our entire lives.Highly recommended for couples, families, and anyone who wants to splurge and have a good time. ", " We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our holiday to the Big island and Oahu. After nearly two days of travel from the UK we picked this resort as we wanted to relax for our first few days and have everything on site. This was definately the right decision the resort is very large, so it never seems overcrowded, there are many pools, one day we had a small pool all to ourselves as everyone else was at the larger pools. We had an ocean front room on the ground floor, large room, and just a hop, skip and jump from the ocean. The rooms at this hotel are reasonably priced, food and drinks are a little on the pricey side but good value for money. There are so many staff you never waited for service all staff were helpful and very polite. Would definately return. ", " This is a very nice place to stay. We had lots of things to choose from to keep us busy. The pools are gorgeous and the paths to get there were scenic with plants and trees native to the island.The grounds are meticulously manicured and clean. It was the best of both worlds with the Pacific on one side and pools and a large lagoon on the other. This was well worth the money. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is truly the best hotel to stay at-definitely on the Big Island and probably all of Hawaii- if you have young children. Firstly, the resort is MASSIVE. Easily as large as a small town. You make your way around by monorails or boats if you don't feel like walking....both of which are convenient and fun. The hotel is composed of three \"towers\" (Ocean, Palace, Lagoon) where rooms are located. I have gone twice and stayed in the Ocean Tower. The rooms there (both deluxe ocean view/front) were VERY spacious, with comfortab beds, large bathroom, a separate sink area, and a refiegerator. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping did a great job daily. The shampoos, etc are all frm the hotel's spa, so they smell (and are) incredible. Definitely make a point to take some home!Aside from the fact that the rooms are great, the hotel grounds are gorgeous. They have three massive swimming pools (one is an ACRE!) all with water slides, toys, poolside bars, varying depths. One is even a \"sandy water\" pool which my five year old nephew was quite enamored with. They have a saltwater lagoon....another highlight...where tropical fish and endangered sea turtles swim around....this is great for beginning snorkeling, swimming, etc. They even have rentals for kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, etc all right there. They have numerous restaurants on the premises, but if you are getting tired of those, there is a shuttle that will take you to the nearby Kings & Queens shops, which have even more restaurants, (including fast food if you're running out of $), numerous shops, and an ABC Store for odds and ends. The breaskfast buffet is honestly the best breakfast I have ever had in my life. Yes, it is a little pricey, but you will not regret it. They have everything...and it is the best of the best. The view while you're eaing cannot be beat.All in all, this is a 6 star hotel. Great rooms, beatiful location....your kids will be in heaven with alll the pools, animals (did I mention Dolphin Quest is locate IN THE HOTEL?)It's not on a sandy beach....in fact, there isn't a beach at all, but you can climb some jagged lava rocks and get into the ocean. But if you have a car, you can drive to nearby beaches. The pools/lagoon make up for the lack of a beach...believe me!I could go on and on.....the bottom line is this place is incredible. It is expensive.....but you get what you pay for, and the Hilton is beyond worth it. Easily more magical than Disney if you have kids, and a beautiful spot for families/couples if you do not.Forget the Four Seasons....this is where you want to be. ", " Make sure you're a Hilton Gold Member. You can sign up for the AMEX Hilton surpass card for that and get gold membership for a year. This gives you vouchers for breakfasts every day. This also allows you to use the Spa whenever you want.If you are going for that timeshare tour, i hope you bargained regarding the parking before you decide to book the hotel. Fly with miles if you can! ", " Flew over from Oahu to stay at the Waikaloa for a week for our anniversary and it was wonderful. Staff very accomodating...changed off of the first floor since patio door opened right out to garden area and we prefer leaving the glass door open at night, both for the fresh air and the sound of the ocean...and our request was handled instantly with no hassle. Pool is awesome! And was very nice to watch each sunset from Buddha Point at the one end of the resort, Kona-side sunsets are stunning!! Monorail very nice...boats running, but not as frequently. Helpful hint...if walking from Ocean Towers back to lobby area, it's significantly quicker to cut across internal paths by lagoon and pools, don't walk the perimeter. This came into play the couple days we got an early start and the train and boats weren't running yet. Room was very clean and bed was extremely comfortable. Will definitely stay here again! ", " This hidden treasure is located on the west side of the \"Big\" Island (Hawai'i), and our only issue is that my better half & I flew into Hilo vs Kona during the Ironman Triatholon weekend last October. This resort has everything you need, and is easly assessable for all travel agencies if by some chance you choose to venture to the east side and explorer the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, but that will be a good 12-14 hour day, so plan accordingly. ", " My wife and I are island hopping in Hawaii to celebrate our 30th anniversary and spent the big day itself at the resort. We did have some misgivings beforehand and were a little concerned about staying at such a mega resort - but we needn't have worried. At this time of year. It's low season so for us it was great as there was plenty of space, easy to get beds, tables in restaurants and bars. Expensive - yes, but not in comparison with resorts of a similar standard, if you're not prepared to pay the going rate then book somewhere else. The provision of a good sized fridge means that if you want to stock up yourselves then you can anyway.For our anniversary we booked a dolphin experience in the morning, couples spa session in the afternoon and then a romantic evening dinner at Buddha Point in the evening. It took a few emails, but all were arranged in advance from the UK. The dinner was spectacular overlooking the sea at sunset - thoroughly recommended for special occasions.In general we found the resort itself to be stunning, immaculately kept and very tranquil. The restaurants we ate in were also all good quality. The only downside would be the Boat Lodge - not because of the food, but we found the smell of fuel a little off putting when we were eating each time a boat docked. The room we had in the Ocean Tower was big, clean and very comfortable. Al in all a fabulous stay which was perfect for our celebration, will have no hesitation in staying again (in low season) if we return to the big island. ", " We loved it! Seemed more fairly priced than other close by resorts. Had great transportation around the resort, my son just loved the boats that take you to your room. Japanese restaurant was excellent, staff was friendly, rooms and grounds were clean. We will be back for sure! ", " This resort was magnificent!! Everything is gorgeous and incredibly maintained! I couldn't take enough pictures! ", " We stayed for a few nights while waiting to check into our condo. This was a fabulous resort. Our boys could run all over and venture in all the fun water features while we relaxed. We payed extra for the daily happy hour at an executive suite. View of the ocean, golf course were spectacular!! Our room was great and we enjoyed all the art work that the resort has on its walls. The water taxi was also fun to take around the resort. We would love to stay here again ", " We initially spent 5 nights at the Westin in Maui. Maui was amazing and Hanna was pretty interesting. Then 4 nights on the Big Island, It is 180 degrees from Maui, which is a positive, diversity is GREAT!!! The first impression was amazing to see where travelers, stopped and wrote names and symbols in the which coral, with the black lava rocks, abundant! We signed up for a 4 night stay at this Huge Gorgeous Resort and they gave us $100. back to use anywhere in The Resort, which ended up being the Japanese Steak House. They also gave us a free rental car for 5 days, which was a first. I believe I only paid $299. for this resort... We traveled to the Volcano National Park during the day to see the gorgeous sight of an active volcano and all of it's enormity. That evening, after a box lunch - we went to the active volcano at the ocean's edge, with flash lights in hand, there was lava covering the ground. The amazing sight of seeing the hot molten lava spewing from the under belly of the volcano, it directed the lava to the ocean, unending! We had to keep a safe distance from the active volcano, in that 30 people had been too close and the lava gave way and they were swallowed into it. The Hilton was like a Disney Resort, it has trams and water boats, on tracks, to get you to your desired destination. They are the only resort, we have seen an open lagoon, that feeds from the ocean, where you can rent paddle boats, kayaks, etc. They also offer a Dolphin Encounter. We saw many turtles and other sea creatures. One turtle came up for air, by us and gasped at how close we were and didn't resurface. We also did the swimming in Maui at the black rocks by the Sheraton, the Sea Turtles, typically arrive in the Afternoon and are AMAZING, at one point, I back peddled, they are very domesticated and have no problems with human interaction!The day we flew back to Maui, we drove to The Grand Wailea Resort, which is amazing in itself and ate at Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger... Just enough time to take in that sight, prior to our evening flight... Loved Hawaii!!! ", " The grounds are meticulously maintained and the views are incredible. The property has a lagoon that leads right out into ocean-you can snorkel from your lounge chair right out into open waters. The staff are friendly and professional. I've stayed at several Hilton hotels both in the United States and several in Europe and the grounds here are among the best-great place to stay on the Big Island. ", " This was our third time there in 7 years. The property is like no other from the natural salt water lagoon where the kids rented kayaks nd swam with fish and sea turtles to the Dolphin Quest program with educational dolphin experiences. I am a veterinarian and do not approve of most dolphin swim tank places. This is great! Food quality has declined at the restaurants on premise, so see my Hilo Bay cafe post. We stayed at the Hilton Grand Vacation club condo at Kahula suites down the road from hotel and had full priveldges at Waikaloa village. ", " We've stayed in this resort twice in the last 3 years and loved it both times. If you want a hassle-free relaxing trip with kids, ths is the place to go. We stayed in an Ocean view room in the Ocean tower. Our view was of the big Buddha statue at Buddha point. On this last trip we even saw whales passing through, playing in the water not far off shore. Sitting on the balcony watching whales is an amazing experience! I think we saw more from our balcony than on the entire 2 hour whale-watching boat trip we took. On the first trip there was a turkey at our back door! The kids loved going from restaurant to restaurant collecting the colorful wristbands they hand out. The food is nothing exceptional but it's fairly tasty especially at the KPC. The lagoon was our favorite spot to hang out during the day. Swimming with turtles with snorkle gear is a must-do experience. The pool water is cold in February and the sun goes down early but I imagine it's better in the hotter months. We did not do the dolphin experience as we've done it in Mexico but it's a treat to watch them play every time you pass to and from the pools. Riding the monorail and boat from the room was fun for the kids. They never tired of it. Yes, it's a jaunt from one end to the other but there are lots of options to walking and sometimes a nice walk through the resort hits the spot after dinner. We enjoyed going to different pools and activity areas for different parts of the day. This keeps the kids excited and entertained and breaks up the scenery for the parents too. We like this place a lot. ", " Ok, it\u2019s my turn. I read these reviews every day for a month prior to our trip to the Waikoloa Hilton. At one point, we actually considered cancelling our trip due to these reviews. Now that we are home, it\u2019s my turn.To everyone that complains that they had to walk too much, I say what\u2019s the hurry. Wait for the next tram. Even if you just missed one it will only be about 5-7 minutes until the next one arrives. They move along faster than you can walk, they are air conditioned, enjoy it. The boats do meander a bit and are more of a novelty for kids. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and walked from pool to pool or over to the Lagoon, but generally took the tram when coming/going from the property. To anyone that said this property is in need of renovation or complained about it being dirty in any way, I say, ask your doctor to increase your anti-depressants. This place is immaculate. I\u2019m sorry, but the landscaping is perfect, they have about $5M of artwork along all of the walkways and corridors, there are beautiful fish and birds all along the way. Sorry, you\u2019re too picky if you have anything negative to say about this places cleanliness or ambiance. If you think you remember it being better when you were a kid, you probably felt better about Santa Claus in those days too.To anyone that thought their room was too small. Sorry, I was in Ocean Tower 6094 and it was just fine for us. The fridge was adequate, the room was big enough for us, the view was spectacular, and we were far enough away from the bird sanctuary that they didn\u2019t bother us. Yes, there are very noisy birds somewhere near the Ocean Tower. I\u2019m talking Jurassic Park noisy. When they are assigning your room simply ask the receptionist to ensure you are far away from these birds or you will probably want to go buy a shotgun after your first 5 AM encounter with them. To anyone that thought this place was better for families with kids and not for couples, well, my wife and I have been married for 34 years. We came there alone and LOVED it. There were many honeymooners there too. Many couples that we met (on the trams) said they were having a great time and loved this place.To everyone that commented that this place is way too expensive, you are right. It is. Don\u2019t eat there. Don\u2019t buy a candy bar. Don\u2019t buy water there. Go to Costco and/or Wal-Mart when you get there and load up. Turn right when you come out of the airport. Costco is on the left a couple miles down. Wal-Mart is a few miles further. We bought water, snacks, items for breakfast, and lots to drink. I\u2019m sure we saved a bundle. We found great restaurants and fair prices nearby. We did eat at onsite at Kirin one night. It was not too expensive and very good. I used Hilton Honors points for our stay and had a final bill of ZERO. It was great.Bottom line for us was that we loved this place. They get an A+ from us. ", " We went to Waikiki for four days and Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, then came here for four days. This was the perfect way to wind down the vacation. My brother and I brought four kids ages 11 - 14. They had a blast. Water slides, pools galore! Dolphin quest, black sand beach snorkeling, Island tours to the volcano. The only thing I wish is that there were \"activities\" at night, other than the Luau. We definitely had a blast. There is a tram and a boat that can bring you everywhere. The place is huge, but we also walked when we weren't in a hurry. There are restaurants, but the ones open for dinner are expensive. By far my favorite thing was to get my coffee in the morning while the kids slept and sit and watch the whales breaching right off the coast of the hotel. Just an amazing place. Wish I could live here. ", " As soon as you enter the open lobby you may see a tram pass by or a boat. This resort is so big that you may want to take one of these to get to your room. It is built around a cove and has everything from parrots to flamingos to dolphins in 2 different pools. Their Dolphin Quest program allows you to feed the dolphins. There is a protected lagoon, several pools, water slides and a lazy river. A breakfast buffet is served in their round breakfast room overlooking the lagoon and waterfall. There is also a luau area, shops, and a rope bridge. If you decide to walk to your room there is a covered outdoor walkway next to the train tracks and boat canal which has different art works and Sculptures and passes by Chinese and Japanese restaurants. We were in the Ocean tower and had a view of the ocean from our balcony and a view of the canals and tram when we opened our door on the courtside side. The room had a refrigerator and was neat and clean. The best part was that we only had to pay the self parking fee of $15/day since we used our HHonors points. Our gold member status entitled us to free internet access and $60 in food coupons during our 3 day stay. It is only a half hour from the airport. This is truly a unique resort. ", " the good:- spacious rooms, well appointed. - huge hotel grounds with gardens, swimming pools and a man-made beach, its own lagoon for snorkling, its own dolphin show - close to two small shopping areas with a grocery store, fast foods, restaurants, etc. if you have a car. takes a while to walk there i guess- again, it's huge. there are four parts in the hotel, lobby, palace tower, ocean tower and lagoon tower, which are connected by a shuttle tram and boat. boat service is less frequent and slow.- great place if you like to walk. takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other.- museum like displays with artifacts from asia and pacific islands along walk corridors connecting between buildingsthe bad - the restaurants are expensive, i guess it's expected at a place like this- not so great a place if you hate to walk- parking lot is a bit far away, but you are on vacation, what's the hurry?- no long streches of beaches, only patches of small beaches to one side of the hotel, takes some walking to get there.  we spent two nights at this place, walked around a lot and enjoyed this place. depending on what you look for at a hotel some will love it while the others hate it. ", " I won a trip and spent a week at The Hilton Waikoloa.The hotel is nothing short of spectacular. It was the most amazing place i have ever had the pleasure of satying. The Grounds were amazing, there was so much to do and see with in the grounds you would not want to leave the resort during your stay. We had the most spectacular view of the sun setting over the Pacific.Truly a paradise.The staff at this resort were incredible, so friendly and helpful. The onsite dining is world class, a huge variety. ", " This has become one of my happiest places on earth! This resort will not let any of your senses down. Visiually, it's spectacular and you feel like you're in another world with the food, art, transportation (yes by boat, tram or walking). Pools are wonderful too. This is not an inexpensive vacation, but is worth EVERY PENNY! Also, the best massage I have ever had was at this resort! I liked it better than the Four Seasons up the road a bit.Make sure you rent a car and tour the island. It's 100% safe and there are so many secrets to find - especially perfect beaches! ", " Stayed here 5 nights. Loved the scenery of the hotel with it's lagoon, water canals, waterfalls in the pool, and gardening presentation. Relaxing atmosphere, I could have spent days just lounging around and there are also onsite activities to keep you occupied. I would have done some spa services but thought they were over priced. Yeah, I'm in a secluded area and in Hawaii, but don't price gouge me. The resort is so big it has a Disneyland style mono rail to take you around. The only complaint is the slow service of the mono rail. We stayed in the Ocean towers, which was a bit far removed from the rest of the resort. It takes about 7 minutes for the tram to take you to the lobby, and that's not if you missed it and have to wait 15 minutes. If decide not to wait for the tram and you walk the route, which is beautiful, it takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the parking area. Lot's of places to eat on site, though pricey, the food is good. This was a nice place. ", " This Hilton is huge. So huge that you need a tram or boat to get you from building to building. There are 4 towers plus a convention center with over 1,200 rooms. Many pools, slides,, rope bridge, dolphin encounter, snorkel lagoon (on property) and more. We loved it. We would come back in a flash. ", " We stayed here back in 2007 seems like only yesterday. Absolutely beautiful hotel, facilities etc. Immaculately clean. The rooms were immense, with loads of room, even with all our stuff in. The layout of them was very good also. This resort was more than i could have ever imagined. The breakfast buffett was gorgeous and set you up for the day, whether you choose to have a relaxing day or take advantage of the activities on offer. The landscaped gardens are maintained to a high standard and the wildlife was a joy to see. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful too. I would love to go back one day, as would my children. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. ", " We spent 4 days at the village over spring break. We had a lagoon/dolphin/ocean view room with a king, sofa, and a roll away bed. I think this tower is the best location on the property. It is closest to the entrance and parking lot. It is also the closest to the large pool and water slide. Gift shops and spa are also in this part of the village. The rooms were spacious and the 4 of us never felt crowded. It is a very large resort, so plan on doing a lot of walking just to get here and there. One day, we took advantage of a fun pass $39 daily(offered at check-in) that gave us unlimited soda in a souvenir cup, half off lagoon beach toys, spa access, free parking, and round of putting golf for 4 people, ice cream for 4, half off tennis court time and in room high speed internet. They were out of souvenir drinks cups and had a limited amount of ice cream cups. I was told they ran out of ice cream sandwiches because they don't have space to store the ice cream. It seems absurd when you look at the size of the place! It was still worth it for the day. We only ate at the grill by the lagoon for lunch. We all had hamburgers and they were very good. Hawaii is expensive so it is always difficult to say if the meal was worth the money. We always utilize the refrigerator to eat 2 meals in our room. Cereal/fruit for breakfast and deli meat sandwiches for lunch cut down on our food bill. I wish we would have stayed for a week. There is so much to do at the resort, we didn't want to leave. I would definitely stay again. ", " Family friendly,fun property. We loved the Dolphin Quest experience my kids who are teenagers found so many things to do we had to reign them in to do things as a family. My kids loved the tram and/or boat that took you across the property,but on the downside it can take a while to get from one end of the property to the main lobby.The Spa was amazing and the staff was wonderful. The entire staff at the hotel was wonderful.I would recomend getting the family fun package,which included free soft drinks in the provided mug. Free mini golf and free ice cream is also included in the package along with parking and reduced beach rentals the package was well worth the price. ", " The resort is amazing with plenty to do for the whole family!The resort itself has a great snorkling area where you can swim with sea turtles and other ocean fish.I recommend bringing your own snorkle gear as the cost of purchasing your own is about the same as one day's worth of rental.There are a ton of great places to go on the island too and the staff was amazing at hooking us up with snorkle adventures. beaches too see, and maps to get to Volcanoe National Park and other attractions. ", " We just spent 5 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and loved it!We were there 15 years ago on our honeymoon and loved it back then so it was very special to bring our kids back and visit the Hilton again!It is such a great hotel for kids. Our kids are 10 and 13 and they loved the lagoon and the pools. The lagoon has so many different things for kids to try. Our kids did snorkeling, water bicycles and surf boarding. They also did the dolphin adventure.We went to the Luau and loved the show. I don't see how anyone can go to Hawaii without doing the Luau.Everyone seems to write about how big the hotel is and all the walking you have to do but I really don't find it that big. In fact many times we skipped the tram and just walked to breakfast from the Lagoon Tower. The trams and boats give the hotel a dreamlike quality. The beautiful architecture of the buildings makes it feel like being on Fantasy Island.My favorite spot is the ocean trail; especially where it goes over the lagoon and you can look out and watch the waves crashing.The grounds are meticulously maintained. I went out for a run every morning at 5 am and workers are out everywhere watering things, scrubbing the walk, and maintaining the property. It is very well maintained.We did have a few problems with the room like a toilet seat that didn't stay up, and a loose bolt on the back door but maintenance came immediately and fixed both of those problems.We only ate at the buffet breakfast and Kirin restaurant. We liked both very much. I liked where they used to have the buffet when we stayed there 15 years ago. It was a little more decorated I think.We valet parked are car and that worked out very well. Every time I needed the car it was brought up immediately.We drove to Hapuna beach several times and it is a short drive from the Hilton. It is a great beach to visit and our kids loved it.The van tour we took was fantastic. That was booked through the Discovering Hawaii Tour and Activity Desk. We also booked our dolphin adventure and the Luau through them and they were very helpful.There is a great little coffee shop called the Lagoon Spoon that can save some money on breakfast. We got egg and ham sandwiches there one morning and they have a microwave so you can heat them up. This was a nice alternative to the buffet especially on the days that we were going out to the beach and wanted to grab something quickly.They had a washing machines and driers located on the same floor as our room. That worked out very well. Even in a 5 night stay we somehow manage to go through clothes so fast.There is a coffee machine in the room and it dawned on me that I could use it to make the Starbucks vias I had brought along. So a bottle of water and some milk and we were all set for delicious in room coffee.This is an amazing resort! You have to like big fancy hotels or it won't be for you. But the nice thing is you get a nice mix of big fancy hotel and the beautiful Kona coast and the walk along the coast.And if you are into golf there are 2 great golf courses. I played the Beach Course the last time we stayed there but this time didn't have time for golf due to the kids. Quite a different experience visiting with kids compared to going here on our honeymoon.I could go on and on about all the neat things at this hotel but you'll just have to visit for yourself to see them all.Steve ", " they had a tram and a boat available if you did not want to walk through their very large hotel. the rooms were a great size, they had a electric sign that said where and how long it would take the tram or boat to your very spot, they had a lagoon with various water toys, sooooo cool, they had shops, 2 pools, water slides, a beach, bars, restaurants, and it was so awesome. they also had a spa, an activities center, and it was the coolest hotel i have ever been to. it is very family friendly. they also have museum walkways it you would rather walk. ", " This hotel has all the amenities you need and never have to leave the hotel grounds. Everything is here for you. However, we spent most of our time away from the hotel otherwise what's the point of going somewhere and not venturing out. We were lucky and received a great deal otherwise we wouldn't have stayed here. We normally avoid upscale hotels because they are pricey, and so is everything you do within the hotel. Gave it a 5 cause it does have everything you will need. ", " We went 10 years ago and returned for our 20-year wedding anniversary. We renewed our vows while we spent a week on and off the resort. Played both golf courses, dined at the resort, enjoyed the multiple pools and had a marvelous trip. The staff from the greeters to front dest to the wait staff and room attendants were first rate. Would highly recommend to couples and families alike. Aloha and Mahalo! ", " The rooms and the entire resort were in great condition. The pools and lagoon were awesome as were the spa, tennis, and fitness facilities. The nearby golf courses were in great shape. The views were awesome.The downside is that it can be a bit hard to get around as the complex is so large. But it's Hawaii so we weren't in any rush. The restaurants were good but nothing too special. It was pricey but such is Hawaii. There are some shops near-ish to the hotel but they are not as close as we thought. It's at least a 15 minute walk depending on where your room is. ", " This was our first trip to Hawaii, so we were really looking forward to our time here. I had read many reviews, both good and bad, and I felt that we were ready for our stay at the Hilton. So thanks to the previous reviewers for your help!First impression: The hotel itself is very pretty to drive up to. The valets in the front are very helpful and friendly, but when we arrived, there were so many people in their rental cars trying to get in and out of the driveway that it was very difficult for our shuttle to drop us off. It wasn't the fault of the hotel at all, but we noticed that some of the guests were very impatient and self-absorbed. Fortunately for us, that was the only time or place that we ever experienced that type of attitude our whole trip.Check-in: This was easy for us because my husband's company had its own check-in separate from the hotel lobby. However, any time we ever had to go to the lobby or concierge for anything, we were always greeted warmly and given whatever help we needed.Room: We stayed in the Ocean Tower on the 3rd floor. Outside our sliding door was a lovely porch and a grassy garden. Our view, compared to many of our friends' rooms, was not good. We just had the grassy area behind our room, and we could barely see over the wall. I'm sure that if we were higher up, our view would have been better. The Ocean Tower is very close to the Cantina and the Ocean Pool. The pool is a great pool. It is several pools that are connected by slides. Our son and his friends loved it. Some of our friends were in the Palace Tower, and their views were beautiful. They could see the ocean, the grounds and the golf course. Our room itself was very spacious, with a king sized bed and a pull-out couch. Even with that and the dressers and desk, we felt that we had plenty of room to walk around in. The bathroom, sink area, and closet were also big in our opinion. We felt that although it is showing a bit of its age, they have worked very hard to keep it clean and beautiful.Grounds: Okay, we had read many complaints about the resort being too big. It was actually not too big for us. In fact, we loved being able to walk around and enjoy everything that the resort offered. We took the tram a few times, and we enjoyed the boat as well. If you're in a hurry, it honestly is so much better to just walk. There were many different ways to get to different parts of the resort, and it was never too far to walk. The pools were great, and depending on what you're looking for, you'll find the right pool for you. The lagoon was awesome for family time, snorkeling and people watching. There was an adults-only pool, and I think that people enjoyed it well. There was the big pool with the larger slide, and then there was even a sandy pool that was very shallow for little kids. Many people even snorkeled outside the lagoon area into the more open sea. Some people were able to see whales from the grounds. My husband's company had breakfast for us every morning and a few dinners, so we didn't have to go to any of the resort's restaurants. Service: Every single person we encountered who was employed by the Hilton was amazing. People were warm, friendly and accommodating. There was one time that housecleaning forgot to change our towels and leave us toiletries, and we called the front desk to ask about it. They were ultra-apologetic (even though we weren't really upset), and they immediately brought up the towels and three sets of the toiletries. That's service.Area around resort: We walked to both the King's and Queen's Marketplace. There were great shops and restaurants. We ate at Island Fish & Chips one night and enjoyed the walk-up & sit service. Another night we ate at Roy's Waikoloa, and we loved the service and food there as well. We rented a car one day to spend the day at Hapuna Beach. What an absolutely beautiful beach. I've been to many white-sand beaches (Aruba, Gulf Shores/Destin, Cancun/Playa del Carmen), and Hapuna is not white like that. But for the big island, it was white. It was more tan than white, but the water was clear, and there was great snorkeling. Another day, we walked the trail behind the hotel toward A Bay. The trail itself is very rocky, so I would wear something other than flip-flops. The beach there is not as great as Hapuna, but it was still nice. One night, we attended a luau at A Bay, and that was amazing. We took a tour to the Volcanoes National Park, and we enjoyed that as well.We LOVED our time in Hawaii. And we LOVED the Hilton Waikoloa. What an amazing vacation! ", " My wife and I have stayed here twice in the last two years. We are locals from Honolulu and we still love coming here, especially with friends and family from out of town. There's something here for everyone. The food choices are excellent. We love dining at the high end restaurant overlooking the water. The monorail and boat are special features that make this place special. And the huge Asian art collection is worth the stroll through the common areas. The rooms are very comfortable, large with roomy bathrooms and closets. Each of the towers that house the guest rooms could be a free standing hotel. The common areas are exquisitely maintained. And the sheer size of the property makes it feel like you're at a boutique hotel with just a handful of other guests. We will continue to return when we can. ", " The suite was a 2 story wonderful suite with a huge patio with a hot tub, a BBQ grill and a dining area.The bonus was the direct steps to the dolphin lagoon from the patio.We felt like dolphins were on our own backyard pond.We had continental breakfast to go from the restaurant to eat on the patio.All ofthe pastries and fruits were fresh and delicious.We will be back to the hotel. ", " I got married at the Hilton in march 2012. I can honestly say everything was fantastic. From the moment I contacted the Hilton every need was meet without hesitation. My event coordinator was Kristine. She was absolutely amazing. She made everything a breeze, I would literally send her an email with a question and I would have a response in 10 min, she was so organized and got everything right I felt I could trust her to get things done and they were. I had my reception at the waters edge ballroom this room is gorgeous and I highly recommend it. We had 60 guests which filled it out nicely any smaller group and it might look funny. I had the ceremony on the palace garden overlooking the water which at sunset was gorgeous. The chapel is also really cute if you have a smaller group. I had dean as my minister who was fantastic. So many of my guests said he was really great so I definatly recommend him. The hair and make up artist were fantastic they actually had me and my 4 bridesmaids ready earlier so professional and on time. The food was great we had the smoke chicken salad which was ok a very unique taste. The mains we had were the lamb which was massive and cooked to perfection absolutely delicious, the second one was black pepper steak which was not as good a bit to much pepper for my liking but still good. Dessert was great too.The cake I had looked amazing Flowers I organized myself so u can't review theirs. The hotel itself is fantastic all the guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves. All in all a great place to have a wedding. My day could not have run smoother and that was thanks to Kristine my catering manager. The only negative I have to say was they said they would give the bride and groom a room upgrade to the best available room during our stay. They gave us an upgrade to a partial ocean view room which overlooked the golf course I was a bit let down as I was expecting a decent upgrade to a bigger room so me and the bridesmaids would have a nice room to get ready in and have some photos taken. I was lucky that one of my guests got a cheap upgrade on arrival to an amazing room and they let us get ready there. I would highly recommend having your wedding here I couldn't have been happier. ", " Beautifully maintained grounds. Lots of walking to get from one place to another but if you are fit that is part of the fun. We stayed at Ocean Towers and our room had a small balcony with a view of the golf course.There are numerous restaurants to eat at and our favourite was the Chinese restaurant which was reasonably priced. There were plenty of lounge chairs available and a pool for adults only and several places for younger children to safely play. The room was all right, not luxurious but comfortable. There is a nice walk along the beach to the Marriot where there is a fairly sandy beach where you can go swimming in the ocean. We spotted several whales jumping.There are 2 outdoor malls about a 20 minute walk away. We ate at a couple of restaurants there which were very good. There is also a market where you can buy snacks and drinks.We went on the bus tour around the island which was worth doing. It left around 6.30am and returned around 7pm but the time just flew by. The driver was very knowledgeable about the island and made it very interesting.There are lots of stray cats around the property but there are feeding stations which are maintained by a volunteer group. I would go back at the drop of a hat. ", " If you were looking for a retreat in paradise you need look no further. RecommendationsCouples stay at Ocean Tower; Families stay at Lagoon TowerEat the Big Breakfast 1 or 2 times, Fort the rest of the time buy your breakfast at the shopping center up the streetBuy your own bottle of wine or 6 pack and watch the sunset in the isolated cabanasDolphin expierence is worth it if your 10 or underDon't be afraid to skip the Tram and walk once in a while. You might find something new and let's be honest you could use the exercise.Hilton Honors Members receive $10 voucers per day per guestBuy the Big Island Revealed Tour Guide Book.The resort was a ridiculous 70 acres of unique architecture blended with beautiful Hawaiian wildlife. We stayed in the Ocean Tower in an ocean front room. Ocean front is the way to go as you can sit on your balcony to watch the whales and sunsets. Make sure you reserve ocean front if you want to see the ocean; it's funny when people reserve a ocean view and can't believe they have to turn sideways to view the ocean. The room was very spacious for a hotel, even had a walk in closet. We ate at the two casual places they were resonable and food was good. Kimo Bean had good coffee (they better for the price) but the rest of the food seemed to be bought from costco. For example the muffins at the big breakfast were amazing, but at Kimo Bean they were the huge dry processed muffins for $5. Go buy 100% Kona coffee (10% Kona Blend is 90% dirt) and make it in your room to drink on your balcony.The Lagoon is neat to snorkel if you have never been snorkeling before. Pools are a lot of fun.The only complaint is there is no beach, but I guess that is not Hilton's fault. ", " Was there during Christmas, the facilities were great, only issue were the birds nesting in early evening - they were loud enough that even with the doors closed we could hear them chirping. We should have changed rooms but it was comfortable - big bed and pull out for the kids. Best part evening entertainment was taken care of by Disney Channel. Highly recommend the hotel for its amenities and big breakfast - very convenient all on the property. Nearby there was ABC Waikoloa that was a real life saver - quick sandwich. Along the same plaza there was a Macaroni Grill, and eateries in the back for some modified Hawaiian plate dishes. ", " After reading the reviews, I KNEW we would be paying for everything. DUH!!! you would at be at any place too except a condo. I was also expecting the rooms to be dumpy and just a disaster. My goodness people if you have time to look at every liitle mark on furniture and walls, than you are having a very boring vacation!! My family (2 adults, 2 kids ages 10 and 14) have traveled a lot, staying at Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons to a Days Inn Suites. If you are looking for a modern, sleek fully updated room than this is not the place for you. The rooms in the Lagoon tower are large, very comfortable and CLEAN!!!! Nice flat screen t.v., ok beds. I LOVED the separate shower/toilet from the sink. Loved the large sink with a lot of counter space. With the modern hotels, everything is glass and you can see through walls and I personally hate that. As far as the birds, you are in paradise for gods sake, put your fan on in your room and bring ear plugs if you know this would bother you. The grounds are beautiful and yes you have to walk a lot of you want to go walk around. Because you know this ahead of time and DONT like to walk or wait a long time for a tram or boat, than don't come here. Go to a smaller resort!!! The walking actually was wonderful, but I personally walked to the Ocean tower one time, otherwise we were at the Lagoon Tower and left to go out to eat. I loved the fact it was so large as I felt no one was there over Spring Break. The other years of vacation at smaller resorts, we have to rush to get our towels on a chairs at 5 am. Here we came out around 8-9 and not everyone even showed up until around 11. It was awesome!!!FOOD and PRICES---You have FRIDGES in you room, use them!!!! We went to queens market and bought snacks, breakfast food, fruit, water, liquor, etc. I bought a styrofom cooler from there to have in our room and kept our water in all week. ADVICE: bring a couple collapsable coolers from home so you don't have to buy a cooler as it was $14. I always bring gallon size baggies to store the snacks in to bring on the road trips or by the pool. Again, the food everywhere is expensive in this area, so if this is an issue go to Hilo or stay in Kona. Otherwise buck it up!!!! We ate at the Mexican place near the Ocean tower, awesome guac made at your table, Orchid marketplace, and the nicest restaurant (Kanuela) on the property which was nice but not like wow! BUT I knew this from reading the reviews and yes they were not cheap BUT again you should know this coming here. On our vacations we always talk to locals on where to go eat, so we ate out every night and that was awesome!! Nothing was super cheap, but it was reasonable and we knew this going there. One thing I had learned on the reviews is a thing called the ALoha FUN PASS that this Hilton resort offers. YOU NEED TO ASK FOR IT as not everyone knew about it. Ask for it when you check in. Its 39 a day and that inlcudes: a Pineapple cup for each person in your family that you can have umlimited soda, if you decide to have tropical drinks, its a couple bucks cheaper in your cup. One free ice cream a day for each person in your family, free wi fi in your room, 50% off lagoon rentals, free parking compared to $15? or 6$ a day valet parking compared to $21 day. Plus a couple other things included. You get your cups and free ice cream from the Orchid Market which is by the Lagoon tower pool. There is also some meal plan they offer at the different restaurants on property. We did not do that and of course was not told about that either. SO MAKE SURE TO ASK!!!!!. A sushi placed called Sansei in Queens market has a happy hour from 5-6? on Sundays and MOndays where all food is 50% off. No ressies. We went on a Tuesday between those times and it was 25% off all items. You can make ressies on these nights. Our favorite place was a local spot in Kanihe, which was about a 10 minute drive, called the Seafood Bar and Grill. We called ahead to let them know a party of 8 was coming around 5:30. This place was Hawaii, cute small bar/restaurant, slight view, fantastic food and service. Prices were average BUT again you in Hawaii. The Bar by the Lagoon Pool was awesome as Brian and Timmy? Jimmy? were fun bartenders to get info from. POOLS: Lagoon tower pool was cold, but later on in the week felt great. Had hulu lessons, snorkeling lessons, and water aerobics which were all free. That was fun. There is also a zero entry sand pool for little ones by this pool too. Lagoon: Awesome!!! Especially when using your Aloha pass and getting 50% off rentals. Kids went snorkeling, I went paddle boarding. Where else can you swim in safe ocean water with a great sandy beach and touch real sea turtles as you are snorkeling? I love the ocean but get freaked out by the tides, so to me this was perfect!!! Ocean tower pool: Never saw but my kids said the water was warmer and had a really fast slide. The slide attendents made it fun for the kids ranking them as they slide down. The husbands would take our kids over there from the Lagoon pool. 15 minute walk? Beautiful ocean to walk by.Dolphin pool: Fun to sit and watch the dolphins train.Excursions: Drove to Hilo side and went to the Volcano National Park, very cool to see but very long day. There was no lava flowing so be sure to check before hand. Talked to a woman a the pool who was taking a tour there and thought she would get to see lava flowing. At the time it was not. BEST: Going to the top of Mauna Kea. 3 other adults went all the way to summit, my husband said it was incredible. I stayed with the kids and we hiked up a hill with blankets and a picnic to watch the sunset. It was absolutly amazing!!! The 3 adults got back in time to watch it with us. Who needs to climb Mount Everest? :) After walking down back to the station, they had set up telescopes to stargaze. It was cool, but very crowded and couldn't hear the volunteer speaking. It does get cold, so wear jeans and bring a sweatshirt. Ziplining with Kohala. Awesome!!! Very safe, learned a lot from Ryan and Rum about the island. Beautiful drive up the coast to get there. There is another popular zipline on the Hilo side but we did not want to drive that far to go back. The Kohala Zipline was about 30 minutes from the hotel. Final advice: This resort is for families that are active and like variety. It is large, which I was worried about, but glad it was as it wasn't crowded at all compared to other places we have stayed at over spring breaks. Service was awesome, grounds were clean and rooms were fine, nothing fancy but not disgusting either and I'm a clean freak!!It is expensive all over this area, so if you want cheap, go to a timeshare in Hilo or Kona.There are not sandy beaches at most of the resorts on this side. There are beautiful beaches you can go to nearby. Plan your excursions, we went to Hilo side on a Sunday, as we were told less traffic. It was less traffic and not as busy as when we went driving around the other days. We really wanted to go horse back riding but they were full. So if you are planning to go during busy times, plan ahead. The topography here is lava rock, grassy plains to the rainforest. I personally found it very interesting.PLease please remember this is Hawaii and unless you are camping, stop complaining about how expensive it is. Use common sense!! ", " We visited Hilton Waikoloa in mid-March of 2012. We have been to this property multiple times, primarily for meetings in the high tech sector. This is a great place for couples, families, individuals. I especially enjoy the lagoon area to relax, read a book, enjoy the warmth. ", " This is a fabulous hotel with enormous grounds for exploring many things. Get your exercise by walking around and exploring the many facets of this resort. There are pools on both sides of the resort so you don't have to walk far if you don't want to. We generally ate dinner offsite due to better rates. If you don't like the minor birds in the morning & dusk, don't ask for a Lagoon Tower room. We'll take those rooms any day over any others. Lots of positives at this place. The Lagoon for paddle boating and snorkeling was just outstanding. Biggest negative was the daily parking rate on their own grounds. ", " I have stayed at this property six times since 1986. It was a Westin for a short period of time but Hilton acquired the property in the late 1980's or early 1990's. There have been some changes but the property itself has been well maintained and it is a first class hotel.When I was here in 2007, I was a little disturbed because of all the \"Hilton Vacation Club\" guests. They tended not to be the type of guest that one would normally encounter at a Hilton property. For example, when I was here in 2007 a group of \"Club\" vacationers took their room sofa and chairs on the lawn and proceeded to have a BBQ with their ice chest. These were not kids, but adults with kids. It was a bit disturbing and I wondered if the place was \"going to the dogs.\" Apparently Hilton has taken charge of the situation and while there are still a lot of \"Club\" guests here, they seem to conduct themselves in a manner that one would expect of a Hilton guest.The spa is great. I had two massages while I was here (hot stone and Swedish). Both were wonderful and relaxing. The locker area is very nice with an open air hot tub. The monorail and boats still take guests from point to point within the property and they have been well maintained and upgraded. All of the walking paths likewise, have been well maintained. The only thing I did notice was that were there used to be 3 or 4 torches, now there is only one. I guess they are saving on their gas bill, by eliminating some of them.I recommend two restaurants. The first is the Kamuela Provision Company. It's a Pacific Rim type menu. The food is good, but the best part of this dining experience is having an oceanside table at sunset. The surf is just below you and the sun melts into the Pacific. The second restaurant I recommend is Imari Japanese Steak House. This is where they cook at your table - make sure to request this as they have regular tables as well. They have fish, lobster, steak, chicken, shrimp and scallops, (and combinations of these) all cooked at your table. The dishes come with traditional grilled vegetables, soup and salad. It's a nice dining experience. You can also get sushi if you want (we did a roll as an appetizer).The Luau is good, but expensive. The best rooms are in the Ocean Tower, facing the Ocean. There is an adult only pool at the Ocean tower along with a \"family pool\" as well.This is truly a resort and other than site seeing there is really no reason to leave the property. Everything you could want is there. ", " First -- this hotel is a must-see, even if you are not staying here. More on that later. But watch out for the self-parking fees -- $3 per hour unless you spend more than $50 at one of their restaurants. The Fairmont Orchid about 15 minutes north will validate your parking for the asking. The Mauna Lani has no fee for parking. We spent $30 to play their putting-green golf course -- not good enough. If you are part of Hilton Grand Vacation, they validate. We are but were still surprised to find this parking fee. If you are not staying there or part of HGVC or not buying $50 worth of food/drinks, park elsewhere (Kings Shops, for example) and walk or take the Hilton shuttle bus. But -- DO GO THERE -- see the dolphins, walk the grounds, take the monorail, or the boat trip around the awesome grounds.... all free. The pools -- there are many -- are beautiful and the waterfall along the walk to the dolphins is beautiful. One can spend several hours on the grounds. And look for turtles along the rocky beachfront. ", " First time to the Big Island and loved our stay. Enjoyed our stay for a 3 day getaway from winter season. It was very nice. No complaints what so ever. We stay in one of the rooms facing the dolphin ponds. We loved it. They don't tell you you have ocean view as well, but we did. Room 311 (or 211) was a great spot could see everything. It cost a little more for the tower rooms but it was worth it, otherwise you are spending more time getting on and off the tram they have. Which if your deal is real good would be worth it as well. It was a great property. Enjoyed the pool with the waterfalls, slids and hot tubs, especially the one in the cave. Fun times. ", " This was stop number two for my wife and I on our honeymoon.We had some idea of what to expect after seeing a television special on this particular resort village.We were not dissapointed.The Hilton Waikoloa Village is a beautiful resort filled with plenty to do and see.Aside from the room decor being slightly outdated, The resort itself has breathtaking views and activities for young, old and inbetween.During the course of our three night stay, we enjoyed the amazing buffet breakfast daily which we included in our travel package, eating in the ballroom that overlooks the beautiful ocean fed Lagoon. The breakfast itself has plenty of options, so there is something there for every tastebud.The lagoon was simply amazing, we hired snorkel gear for $7US each for an hour and were not dissapointed by the amazing ocean life in the lagoon. Little Fish, Slightly bigger fish and even a few Green Sea Turtles who call that lagoon home. Our room was a part ocean view with a view overlooking to pool area and the village boat ride.Both the Tramway and the Boatride were operational during our stay and both were quote enjoyable with the tram giving detailed information about the resort and the island itself.The people operating the Boatride were very friendly giving us opportunities for photos of the local birds who live in the resort on the little islands on the boatride.Plenty of families were there enjoying the Dolphin display on the other side of the resort to where we stayed.There are plenty of Open pool areas with neat waterslides to slide down for a bit of fun. The staff are very friendly and are quite open to a quick chat.Overall, I would definately stay at this resort again, however, next time I would stay for a bit longer than 3 nights as there was so little time with so much to do. ", " This resort is very well laid-out and thought-out. Everything runs smoothly, and it gives the impression of a natural setting, although it was built on a huge lava field. The room was quiet, peaceful, and comfortable. Although my husband and I usually like small local places, this resort was unquestionably wonderful. We found the food expensive and adequate, but this is after all Hawaii, and that seems to be the norm, no matter where we ate. The one jarring note was the repetition of the same audio on the tram. After the third or fourth day of hearing the same comments about the resort and its features, the noise began to grate. This problem could be easily remedied by interspersing that particular message occasionally with either some other similar ones or with some soft music. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village started out as one of the premier resorts in the Hyatt chain, but was sold over a decade ago because it never made a profit. The place was built to host large conventions in its many high-rise towers, but such gatherings are rare in Hawaii and generally Honolulu-based. But Hyatt spared no expense in building the property, decorating it with art pieces, and designing it with the vacationer (as well as the conventioner) in mind. It's just a fun place to stay, what with its train running from the lobby to the outer limits of the property and its canal filled with boats that squire guests back and forth along side the train tracks. The highlight of the place, though, is its swimming pools. They are many and varied, including a salt-water bay that links directly to the ocean. This bay attracts all kinds of interesting fish as well as ocean-going turtles of enormous size which come home daily to sun themselves on the hotel's beaches. Then too there's the \"swim with dolphin\" pool and multiple restaurants, including one of the best Japanese eateries on the Island. I thought the property had a bit more glitz when it was the higher-prized Hyatt, but to Hilton's credit, while it may have cut back on staffing and skimped a bit on the quality of the bathroom toileteries, the resort itself is as wonderful as ever and worthy of a short or long vacation. ", " We stayed 3 nights at this resort. It is very cleanly, kept-up well and a beautiful property. We had a partial ocean-front view, but mostly overlooked the golf-course. While it was just my husband and I, there were a number of families and from what I saw, a number of family friendly activities. There are also a number of 'adult' areas if you want some peace. My personal favourite was the salt-water lagoon that enters into the ocean. I had a ball snorkelling with the fish and sea turtles. We ate at KPC and it was a delicious fish meal, very authentic and well presented.This resort is huge, but if you are not a walker, they do offer a tram (I think it is faster to walk - long waits) and a canal boat. I thought the drinks were very pricy ($13.00 for a mai tai - a bit much for a shot of rum and juice) so if you can, buy alcohol at a store and mix your own! ", " My wife, son and I spent 7 days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort on the Big Island. This was our second trip to the resort: the first was 10 years ago for our honeymoon. Let me begin by saying the service is beyond outstanding; they cater to your every need and if something is not right, they will make it right. Secondly, the hotel grounds are spectacular and clean as can be. The pools are fantastic and the food is wonderful. The Hilton Waikoloa is pricey.....but everything is in Hawaii and you do get hat you pay for. I highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed. ", " My husband and I spent a week here as part of our 10th annversary. We had a beautiful room in the oceanfront tower...but with that comes the inconvience of having to allow alot of time to walk to the other side of the resort to use the big pool with waterfall and slide, allow 1 hour round trip, a 30 minute walk to kpc for dinner one way, 30 minutes to lobby or parking one way...trams and boats are not dependable and they were \"down\"several times during our stay. It doesnt make sense to sit and wait for a tram or boat for 20 minutes if you can walk it in 30minutes...the walk wasnt bad but after a long day or just to go anywhere to do anything you seriously spend alot of time in the commute. My husband hated that! If you get a Lagoon Tower room closer to the main lobby your walk shoud be less.We did love our room and the view, although not particulary fancy or large it was perfect as we had a view of the Budda Point a nightly sunset gathering place. We saw canoes, boats, and lots of kitties every day. The view was incredible. We were at the resort this past June pools were ice cold then and ice cold in February. We got in once but it was just too unbearable...only kids were in the pools. Hot tubs arnt really hot eiether probably around 90 degrees...We liked KPC mainly for the views but it was a good restraunt . Room service is fantastic and very quick and we enjoyed a few meals on our lanai. The grounds are incredibly beautiful with scultptures, flowers, landscaping, koi ponds, waterfalls, art works,etc.It truly gorgeous. We enjoyed the hilton except for the long commutes at the end of the day...and thru out the day...we resented it stold so much of our time. We like the Marriott next door better simply because of its location to get to the King and Queens shops in under 5 minutes, get to your car in 5 minutes, get to Hawaii Calls for dinner in 5 minutes, or the Pool which is heated in 5 minutes, or the real beach in 5 minutes. Marriott isnt as showy but a good solid choice. So if you want all the glamour go for the hilton and bring your walking shoes (we arnt lazy and are fit but it wear s down on you in a week)or if you want a nice hotel with super convience try the marriott. We like them both and would stay at both just depending on if we wanted to spend alot of time at the hotel. But who comes to Hawaii to stay at the resort? Tough decision but eiether you cant go wrong. We loved it except for all the commuting. ", " I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for a week in December. I had a few issues with the billing/rate agreements and spoke with their front desk representative. I will tell you that the Hilton takes their customer comments very seriously. The quality service director contacted me and addressed my concerns. He even provided me reimbursement for the rate difference- and I did not even ask for reimbursement. It is really nice to know that a large corporation like Hilton still takes the time to review each customer comment and call people to find out more information.One recommendation is that I would try to stay in the Lagoon Tower or Palace. The Ocean tower has a lot of birds outside and they can be very noisy. The noise is constant and the birds don't go to sleep until after 10 pm...So, it may work if your hours correspond with them ~Another note about this hotel is that there is a train that can pick you up but if you do not take the train, it is a walk back to your room each time. This was a non-issue for my friend and I but may be something that you consider if you have a wheelchair or small kids. ", " Spent late February at the Waikoloa Village and was really impressed. After travel to the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, this place rocks. Much less crowded and a huge variety of pools from adults only to versions with slides and waterfalls. There were always loungers available regardless of pool selected and the place felt very uncrowded. The vegetation around the resort is diverse and beautiful. We really liked the way the vegetation and architecture were integrated to provide a stunning visual appeal. Staff were very friendly and helpful. All the restaurants provided very decent meals with good service. We really loved the hotel cats and wished we could have taken one home with us. Bird life is amazing. What a pleasant place compared to the Hawaiian Village. Can't wait to return!! ", " I have traveled here 3 different occasions with family. Every time has been a memorable occasion with different delights. One January trip we borrowed some chairs from KPC, one of the best on site restaurants. We put the chairs on the walk way and watched as the Humpback Whales frolicked in the sea just about 200 yards where we were sitting!!!! Lunch at the burger shack includes happy hour and watching the Dolphins play in the lagoon 30 feet from your table, getting across the expansive 66 acre resort include a motorized boat ride through a man-made mote that seamlessly blends with the natural surrounding( yellow Tang and Barracuda included. Evening time provides the perfect sunsets that highlight the beautiful \"Pirate -cave\" water falls and pools, and in the evening.... the night brings forth the plumeria perfumed shadows mysteriously lit with Tiki -Torches throughout the resort!!! If this hasn't inspired you to further research this resort, do yourself a favor take a look or even book a trip. This place is great for honeymooner's, conferences, and families - it's huge, tasteful, and magnificent without being over the top - Vegas style....While the service was always quality and gracious the only down side was the quality of the food at the burger place and breakfast. It's not bad, but for the price I would have hoped for much much better. ", " This was our first trip to the Big Island. My husband had a work conference scheduled here which was great because we plan to take our 4 children back spring 2013 and stay at Kings Land down the road, so it gave me a great opportunity to check out both properties. We loved staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village as a couple, but I don't think we would stay there with our children. When we checked in, we got a room in the Lagoon Tower away from the pool overlooking the roof. It was awful! They were able to switch us the next night to a ground floor room overlooking the dolphins which make such a huge difference! It was ideal right by the pool and lagoon also. I would not have liked to stay on the other side of the property in the other towers and had to walk a long distance or ride the train when I wanted to swim or lay out. So, location is pretty important at this property. We enjoyed the beautiful property very much. It's unbelievable what Hilton has created out of a lava bed! A couple of days after breakfast we went out to Budda Point and relaxed in a lounge chair and watched the whales spout off shore. My husband enjoyed snorkeling in the lagoon and seeing the many varieties of fish and of course the beautiful turtles.Cons: There were a couple of high priced restaurants on property, but nothing great to choose from for a hotel this size. For dinner we walked 15 minutes to Queens or Kings marketplace. (They do have a shuttle also, but the weather is so perfect for walking). We ate at Merrimans which was reasonable and delicious! The only option on property for breakfast besides room service was the main breakfast dining room--$30 with tax for a nice buffet. For lunch there is only a small lagoon side restaurant with only about 10 things on the menu and a small restaurant by the pool with about the same number of items. Very overpriced and you don't really want to leave the property for lunch and dinner. So, because of the limited food options, we are going to stay at the condo at Kings Land next year and make most of our own meals. We will be driving down to the Hilton property because my children will love the pool and lagoon.The staff was polite and overall we had a great stay. I would go back again with just my husband. A delightful property! ", " We, a family of 4, stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for 6 nights. Although everything has a price it was worth it. What you get is a bit of Hawaii packaged into the resort. Turtles in the lagoon that enter from the ocean themselves, fish, dolphins and stunning surroundings. The layout is great if you just do a bit of investigating before coming which we did. Tram worked fine, boats were great to just get a tour etc. The room itself was ok. We had chosen a Banyan room in the Lagoon tower which was perfect with kids (or without). They could go directly to the dolphin pool og Kona pool in the morning and we didn't need to hassle with elevators etc.The Luau was a great show (4 of 5 stars) especially because we had Alii seating. Its worth it.I have stayed in many hotels around the world and have never seen so well maintained grounds before. No dead bushes or palmtrees. Lots of statues from Asia, extremely lush plantation and a nice walkway. Buda point was great for whale watching in the morning and to feel the first sun on your body.Although no \"real\" beach they had done a decent job of making a beach at the resort lagoon with tons of activities (pricey though).I can recommend this facility for a part of your Big Island stay. Just remember there is more to Big Island than the \"Hilton Hawaii\" ", " I celebrated the milestone of turning 50 by treating myself, mom and kids with a trip to the Big Island to stay at Hilton Waikoloa -- it was the best birthday ever! Every staff member was pleasant and helpful, our room had views that are etched in my memory and the entire stay was a dream come true. Our room was spacious and clean and we enjoyed all the things that make this a complete resort: great dining options, endless pools, a variety of activities. We spend longer at the ping-pong and pool tables that I would have thought -- but that's the fun of it: when everything you want is taken care of then you can really enjoy the people you are traveling with. ", " If you are expecting to arrive at the Kona airport and be greeted by people bearing flower leis and lush tropical suroundings then you are in for a surprise. This part of the Big Island is mostly volcanic rock and the terrain is of that of a freshly plowed field. Rent a car from the airport to get to the hotel and then plan to see all of the island. On your dirve to Waikoloa Hilton one feels as though one has been transported to some barren rocky planet, the hotel is only 20 minutes from the airport, but once you arrive at the property all your Hawaiin dreams come true. Beautifully manicured grounds, impressive main entrance and lobby including tropical birds. After check in, you may either take a boat or tram to your room (your luggage arrives via underground passageways) and marvel at the sweetly scented flowers and beautiful vistas of the property. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower overlooking the ocean and Dolphin Quest Lagoon. Definetly the best location, how delightful to sit on the balcony and watch the dolphins jump and play. Our room was large and easlity accomodated four people, including a refrigerator and tea making facilities. There are water sports in the man made lagoon and in fact everything here is man made for one feels as though Mickey Mouse will pop out from behind the next corner. You have plenty of choices to rest by the numerous swimming pools and listen to the waterfalls and ocean waves coaxing you into a hypnotic reverie. The food is expensive and purchase the all-inclusive package if possible. The KPC restaurant is spectacular ocean front dining at its best, the steaks and lobster superb! The breakfast buffet excellent with plenty of fresh fruit, an omlete station and delectable homemade pastries. Hawaii is not a budget minded holiday, but certainly a must see at some point in one's life and the Hilton Waikoloa Village will not dissapoint. ", " We loved our stay at this resort for our entire week on the Big Island. The Kona coast is sprinkled with resorts stretching up north past the airport and it is a beautiful place. Though there wasn't a sand beach right on the ocean, Hilton made up for the lack of a natural sand beach by creating a saltwater lagoon which has access to the ocean. The lagoon is filled with clear seawater, natural volcanic rock and coral, a great calm sand beach to swim in and an incredible array of wild tropical fish and other creatures. The most amazing thing? Swimming in the lagoon and watching wild sea turtles swim right by us either going to the ocean or coming into the lagoon. We preferred the lagoon for swimming than the pools. The pools are nice and large but a little chilly for my taste. There is also a sand pool for tots that appeared to be enjoyed by many who had children. We also enjoyed access to three hot tubs near our tower in the evening. As other reviewers noted, the food onsite is quite expensive. This was offset by the large number of vouchers we received from Hilton when we arrived. Since we rented a 4x4 to tour the island, we did not eat at the resort all the time. The food was quite good, especially at the oceanside restaurant, KPC. But very expensive so be prepared and if you have vouchers, they don't limit how many you can use for one meal. Same with the breakfast buffet. Very expensive but was also very good. I loved the coconut muffins with huge chunks of coconut. Our room was beautiful. I believe they have remodeled the Lagoon Tower we stayed in. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were crisp and clean. We absolutely loved opening our sliding glass door at night (there is a screen door on it if you are concerned about bugs) and listening to the ocean waves and the dolphins softly chattering. Our room was close to the dolphin pool so we could hear them. All of the staff there were very friendly. We enjoyed the little boat ride around the property (more tropical fish in the boat canal including barracudas). We also liked that there were retail shops and other restaurants near the hotel. A wonderful little grocery store where we picked up some wine, snacks and even some nice little souvenirs. Natural beaches on the Big Island are mostly small, scattered about and often state parks so if you are expecting something like Waikiki, you'll be disappointed. But we weren't there to spend all our time on the beaches because there is so much to see on the Big Island. Our favorite places to see included Green Sands Beach, Akaka Falls, Greenwells Coffee Farm and the summit of Mauna Kea for the most spectacular sunset. ", " I found this hotel to be gorgeous. When I think of the Big Island beauty The Hilton Waikoloa comes to mind. It is beautifully landscaped & immaculately kept. All staff we encountered were very friendly & helpful. I can't sY enough about the beauty of the grounds & how well they are kept. The Hilton Waikoloa in my eyes was \"True Hawaii\". There is definitely a fair amount of walking in this resort to get to your room if you don't want to take the tram or boat but I find the walking to be a good thing. It's Exercise! It's good for you! To be in Hawaii, walking the incredibly beautiful grounds of a resort like this is what I enjoy in a vacation. Go for a stroll, take your time & enjoy the beauty around you. Our room was in the Ocean Tower. Room had an amazing view of the ocean, pools & lagoon. The room was large with a walk in closet, small fridge, & large balcony. We never ate on location as none of the restaurants appealed to us & they seemed a little pricey. ", " This resort is huge and has very nice landscaping. I don\u2019t know why some people complain about it. Built on top of lava rocks, it was originally designed as 3 hotels. That\u2019s why there are 3 separate hotel buildings, and connected by museum walkways, bridges, tram, and canal boat. The museum walkway is a bonus that you can see the Asian and Hawaiian artifacts without going to a museum and without paying for the museum admission. You can see the turtles and fish in the lagoon and the canal. They even have flamingo in the garden. There is a koi and lily pond by the Japanese restaurant. This is like a Disney resort, a small zoo, aquarium, museum all in one. Adult and kids love it. We\u2019re adults and didn\u2019t mind seeing children at the resort.Upon arrivalCheck In was slow. There was a line with a few people, but it moved slowly because the receptionists were very personable, answered all your questions patiently. Everyone has questions since it\u2019s such a huge resort. The self-parking lot is in front of the hotel. It\u2019s a very big lot, and it does take several minutes to walk from the car to the room. Just relax and give yourself some time to explore the resort, enjoy the beautiful landscaping, and get used to walking.RoomThere are 3 towers in a V shape location, the Lagoon Tower to the left, the Palace tower to the near right, and the Ocean Tower to the far right from the lobby. The Lagoon Tower is the best choice for family with children because it has the feature pool with waterfalls, water slide, swing-bridge, shallow children pool, and the dolphin lagoon right in front of the tower. The Ocean Tower is the 2nd choice for family with children because there is a multitier large pool with water slide in front of the tower. The Palace tower has no pool but it has a nice water fountain. It\u2019s great for adults want to get away from the children. We stayed at the Palace Tower. The room is simple, not very luxury, but more than adequate. It has a golf course view. In the room TV channel 5 shows the tram and boat departure time, so that you can plan on when to leave the room to catch the tram or boat to avoid the long waiting time. You can also see the departure time at each tram and boat stop. Some people complain about the bird noise. We opened the deck door during the day and closed it at night. We didn\u2019t hear any noise.ResortThe resort is ocean front, but no direct access to the ocean. You cannot swim in the ocean, but there is a nice calm lagoon fed with sea water. This is a smart design because the ocean is too rough to swim in. The lagoon is shallow and safe for children and anyone not comfortable going into the ocean. It\u2019s also a great place to learn snorkeling or surf board paddling, or to test out your snorkeling gear. We snorkeled in the lagoon and saw green sea turtles and some fish.Winter is the whale watching season. We saw whales a few times right from the resort without binoculars. They were like half a mile or a mile from shore. The best spot to see whale is the Buddha point near the Ocean tower. If you scan the ocean for 20 minutes, you\u2019d most likely spot a whale in the winter.RestaurantsThere are several restaurants at the resort and they\u2019re all over priced. That\u2019s a given for any resort. But all restaurants have great view of the resort and or the ocean. We had the Big Island Buffet breakfast, $22 almost every day. It has American food and Asian food, and an omelet station. The fruit selection includes fresh Hawaiian bananas and papaya, very yummy. Overall quality of the buffet breakfast is average, not very good and not bad either. The restaurant has a nice lagoon view. Had dinner at the Hawaiian Cantin at the boat landing at the Ocean Tower. 2 small soft fish tacos, small portion is $16, draft beer is $8. Had dinner at the Chinese restaurant. Again, overpriced average food. But the setting is very nice. Went to the Luau $102 and it was not as good as others. Food was very tasty, but the display was simple. For $102, they didn\u2019t even give us a Lei. The Luau performance was good, especially the man played with fire. Had sandwiches from the Orcmid marketplace by the pool near the Lagoon Tower. Made to order sandwiches with a small bag of chip are $14. Meat portion was big. Our roast beef sandwich was very dry.There are ways to save money on food. There is a Walmart, Costco, Target, and Safeway grocery store 2-5 miles south of the airport. (the Hilton is at the north of the airport). We had a car so we brought bottle water from Walmart. Costco has bottle water too, but they\u2019re in bigger pack. You can buy food items from any of these places. Oh they have souvenir at both Walmart and Target that are cheaper than the ABC store. In the Waikoloa resort area, there are 2 small shopping centers across the street from each other, the King and the Queen. The King, just like its name has designer stores catered to the well-heeled and the Japanese tourists. There is a Roy\u2019s restaurant, too. The Queen shopping center has more affordable shops, 3 restaurants, and a food court. Yes, it has a food court and the price is reasonable. We ate at the food court a few times. There is a Subway, Arby\u2019s, a Mexican place, a Hawaiian place, a ramen noodle (Japanese) place, and a Chinese place at the food court. The Chinese food at the food court is better than the Chinese food at the resort and for half of the price. A couple of places at the food court open at 7:30 am for breakfast. We got breakfast there a couple of times when we want a quick bite and want to head out early to explore the island. There is also Island Gourmet at the Queen shopping center. It\u2019s a big ABC store with groceries and ready to eat food. You can get take out sandwiches, sushi, pizza, etc. to go. If you don\u2019t have a car, the resort runs a shuttle to the King and Queen shopping centers every 30 minutes, starting at 10 AM. It cost $2 each way. Further from the resort, drive 30 minutes toward inland to the east is Waimea. Waimea has a nice steak house called Parker Ranch Broiler. It was very easy to find, in the center of Waimea on the main road, around the corner of Fruitland grocery store. The Parker Ranch Broiler was re-opened under new management in mid- February 2012. They served grass fed beef from their own ranch on the island. We had steak dinner and it was delicious and it was half of the price of the resort. If you want to eat outside of the Waikoloa resort area, it\u2019s at least a half hour drive at either direction. You should go to the Parker Ranch Broiler at Waimea if you want good and reasonable price streak. They also have salads, soup, stew, chicken, pork and seafood on the menu. All resorts in the Waikoloa area are isolated from each other. You cannot walk from resort to resort. To get around or explore the island, you either join a tour or rent a car. We saved money on tours and had the flexibility by renting a car for our week long stay. We really enjoy the Hilton Waikoloa resort and love to go back. ", " Spent six nights here before heading to Oahu. The place is gorgeous; the grounds pristine, the views phenomenal, many choices for dining, very comfortable rooms, many amenities, but, take note, no beach on site.....this is a lava rock area....It is a large resort, very spread out. Someone nicknamed the place \"Walkalotta\" instead of \"Waikoloa\"....:) You will get lots of walking exercise! In fact, there is a tram and a boat system that can be used to get around. This is probably used more by those staying in the ocean towers....which are further out. We stayed in the lagoon tower, which I think was a wise choice because of the large pool with waterfalls and the closer proximity to the main areas. The dolphin encounter area was right outside our balcony! Each tower area has its own pools, or you can hike to another. We took a long walk one morning to check out the whole place to see if we were missing anything! Prices are not cheap...including food.....but, that's Hawaii. The resort is pretty remote, so a car is a good idea, although there is a shuttle to two nearby shopping areas where you can find some other restaurants....like a Macaroni Grill. The closest town would Kona.....about 20 minutes by car. After experiencing the crowded confines of Waikiki Beach, I better appreciated the time we had spent at Waikoloa, with it's beautiful grounds. It was enjoyable to just sit....and take it all in....including the whales!Hope this helps you plan your trip.....I would return, but next time it's going to be Kaui or Maui.. ", " We stayed here from January 18th thru 25th this year with friends that had stayed here a couple times before. It helped a lot that they knew the place well and they were familiar with the Island. Since we booked the trip almost a year prior to going, I spent a lot of time reading reviews and looking at pictures. I knew ahead of time what to expect and was aware of the vastness of the place, the extra costs, the long walks and the cost of parking, so there were no surprises. Actually, it wasn\u2019t half as bad as I had imagined it would be after reading the reviews. The walks were actually beautiful and very enjoyable. We never felt that they were too long. We took the boat once and the tram if we had a lot to carry, but otherwise never minded walking at all. If you take the paths through the gardens, they seem to be shorter and much prettier than walking down the corridor. I never worried about the amount of time it took to get from one place to the other. We were on vacation and everything we did, including the walk around the resort was part of that. The only scheduled event we had was the dolphin tour and we just made sure we gave ourselves plenty of time to get there.We arrived at 10:30pm after a 12hr trip from Illinois. After about a 10min check-in, we walked with our luggage from reception to our rooms in the Ocean Tower. The tram had already left while we were checking in, and we were too tired to wait for the next one. Although it seemed at the time like it was quite a walk, it was pretty with all the artwork in the corridors and the warm tropical air was enough to make me enjoy it anyway. That was the extent of what we saw of the resort when we arrived. We hit the room and were asleep within minutes. I woke the first morning to the most beautiful view from our lanai of the sunrise over the lagoon with the ocean in the background and palm trees swaying. I was hooked on this resort from that moment on! The room itself was on the 6th floor of the Ocean Tower with a beautiful view. It was nice sized, with a large walk in closet, nice flat screen TV, comfy king size bed, a sleeper sofa and a desk. No problems whatsoever in the room. No musty smell as people have complained of in other reviews. We did hear the birds, but they didn\u2019t keep us awake or wake us up. I understand it is worse if you are on the other side of the tower though. We didn\u2019t stay on the resort much. We rented a jeep for the week and took a couple day trips to the other side of the Island to Hilo. Went to the Farmer\u2019s Market and had dinner at a nice Thai restaurant there in town. Stopped for several hours at Cocoanut Island right off of Hilo. Absolutely Beautiful. The other trip was to Akaka Falls and the Botanical Gardens. Both are wonderful, inexpensive and worth the trip! The views from the Botanical Gardens are AMAZING! We stopped along the way at several lookout points and followed paths to beautiful wonderful different beaches to stop and swim or just relax and enjoy the view. We also did a Dolphin Tour with Sunlight on the Water in Kona. VERY nice and well worth every penny. We enjoyed watching the dolphins on the resort, but I believe it was more expensive to do the Dolphin Quest than the tour we took. We only ate dinner on the resort one time at the Mexican Cantina near the boat launch and the Ocean Tower. The food was good and it really wasn\u2019t that expensive. We did have an appetizer of Hot Wings at the Lagoon Grill one night. $9.95 for them and they were very very good! Prices did not seem that out of line for the food we ate. We would have paid that here in our small town in Illinois. However, alcohol was $12 for mixed drinks, so yes, if you had a few of those, they did add up quickly. We planned on eating one night at Imari, but waited too long to make the reservation and there was nothing available for that night, so we didn\u2019t. I would have loved to have tried either there or KPC just one night, because I know it is expensive. We purchased coffee at the shop at the entrance to our tower every morning. The price was comparable to Starbucks and just as good, we didn\u2019t eat breakfast on the resort. We had most meals either in Kona or right outside the resort in the King and Queens Marketplaces. Our first and most expensive meal was at the Fish Hopper on the Ocean in Kona. I highly recommend this place. One night we just grilled out on Hapuna Beach with Veggies and Pineapple we picked up at the Farmers Market and some Chicken we got at Walmart in Kona. We stocked up on snacks, water and Coke at Walmart as well to keep in the room and take to the beach with us. This helped a lot toward not being nickled and dimed by paying for everything at the resort. (they also have boogie boards, swim floats, snorkel equipment- so much cheaper than renting them for the day at the resort) Most of our time was spent at Hapuna Beach a few miles down the road. We ended our evenings walking around the resort and stopping for a few drinks at the Lagoon Grill before heading back to our rooms. Our favorite bartender there is Raina. She was wonderful, sweet and funny. We made sure to return there so we could sit, talk and laugh with her. Ask her to surprise you with a drink and she will come back to you with something yummy. Also met and talked to several other resort guests each night while there. Every member of the staff was always very happy friendly and courteous. Very helpful when we had questions.Since our return flight home wasn\u2019t until 10:30pm, we spent the entire last day enjoying everything the resort had to offer, even after checking out. The hotel kept our luggage for the day, we kept only necessities with us, and they gave us a hospitality room to shower in prior to heading out to grab dinner and head to the airport. We snorkeled in the lagoon, hung by the pool all day and enjoyed every bit of our last hours at the resort. A lot of reviews talked about the pools being very cold. I was very nervous about this, because I do not like swimming in cold water. They were cold, but once you were in, it was comfortable. I could have been happy spending each day staying on the resort, but it was our first time in Hawaii and wanted to experience a lot more of the Island. We did run into a family that was there for 2 full weeks and never left the resort. They were perfectly happy with every moment and I completely understand how they could have been. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Yes, it is HUGE! But that is part of the beauty of it. We were on the tram one morning and heard a couple people who had just met discussing how big the resort was. One of them actually said it was so big it was overwhelming and at one point, she got lost and confused. She laughed and said that she wondered how many times people actually went to the concierge in tears needing helped because they were lost. Our friends and I got a chuckle out of that because we just didn\u2019t see it. To us, it seemed easy enough to navigate our way around and was easy to get from place to place. Everyone looks at things differently I guess. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better vacation in a more beautiful place! ", " Our teenagers loved this so much 2 years ago that we visited again.We had ocean view rooms in the Ocean Tower again. We didn't need to go on a whale-watching cruise as you could watch the whales from the balcony. The rooms weren't too small, and they were clean.The resort is great if you enjoy walking and enjoying the views, especially around dawn. The Lagoon is ocean fed - and this is obvious early in the morning when the tide comes in and the lounge chairs are semi-submerged. We enjoyed the canoeing with turtles swimming around the boat, and paddle boarding in the calm water.The resort restaurants aren't cheap, but we had meals at the restaurants at the nearby shops. The shops are within walking distance if you are feeling energetic (or begrudge the $2 per person each way for the shuttle like we did).My husband and I went on a star-gazing tour at Mauna Kea. The view from the top (approx 14,000 feet) at sunset was spectacular. Especially for such a large resort we found it to be well maintained (the walkways were being re-painted while we were there.) ", " We stayed at this Hilton for 2 nights in January. It was bigger and better than we expected and we expected it to be brilliant! We booked througt the hotel's own website where there are a wide variety of room types. We chose a King Sea view with lanai (balcony) and breakfast. There was valet parking when we arrived. Made sure to have a few \"bucks\" on you to tip the drivers. We waited for the boat outside to take us to our room! Boats run about every 15-20 minutes after 2pm, otherwise it is easy to walk or catch the tram. Our room was overlooking the golfcourse with the sea in the distance but was big and clean. Breakfast was well worth having, the buffet was tasty with an omlette bar. There was hot breakfast and continental things too. The breakfast room overlooks the whole lagoon and waterfall! A sea turtle swam by us in the lagoon and we went to watch the dolfins while eating lunch. There are so many swimming pools and waterslides all over the site. You could spend all day exploring! Hammocks and sun loungers were first come fisrt served. All the staff were very helpful and friendly! We ate the Chinese restaurant which was expensive but very good food. Be sure to visit Kailua-Kona, beautiful seaside town, south of the airport. ", " This is a lovely property - very well manicured. The common areas are big enough so that the pool, restaurants and lagoon never seemed crowded even when many people were in them. Rooms are nice - not overly large, but clean, and have small balconies. Though we did not go into every tower, it didn't appear that any of the rooms would have a bad view.I would definitely recommend this hotel for families, singles, groups - anyone. Everyone ! ", " My wife Sue and I were on a business/pleasure trip and we had stayed here previoulsy during the earhtquake a few years ago. This hotel will never disappoint you. There are 3 separate hotels and we stayed in the Ocean Towers. They happen to be in the shape of 3 rings. The whole hotel is situated on a beautiful cove and our room was overlooking the ocean and a beautiful green on the golf course. The property has upscale shopping everywhere you go. The rooms are spacious with plenty of amenities. There is a monorail system between buildings in the resort. There is also a system of streams with Swiss mahogany boats taking guests around the entire resort. The grounds of the resort have pools everywhere as well as swimming lagoons. The is also a pond with dolphins swimming and a program called Dolphin Quest that allows you to swim with them. I encountered 2 large sea turtles when swimming in the lagoon. They were as curious about me as I was of them. It was a highlight of all our trips to the islands. It is a romatic setting when the sun goes down and the pathways around the resort are lit by tiki torches. Do yourself a favor and stay here just once and you will never, ever, forget the experience. ", " Went to Hilton for a day trip, it is an amazing place to visit, the dolphins are a must see they put on good show. Ride the boat ride the train, walk the grounds there is so much to see. ", " After reading several reviews about the enormity of this place (In fact I think a few people referred to it as a Disney World of sorts.) I was skeptical about booking here. I heard about a monorail taking you across the resort from one side to the other, etc . . . So I was pleasantly surprised at the intimate feel of Hilton Waikoloa. Yes it's big . . . but the way that things are laid out, it had lots of smaller areas for swimming, eating, snorkeling/water sports, I didn't ever feel like I was crowded or waiting in line for anything. . . . When we arrived we did take the map we were given and walked the entire resort to familiarize us with where everything was, and we didn't ever use the monorail the entire time we were there.We did try out a boat-taxi that runs through a special canal that links the resort together. . . it was a fun way of getting around.The food is good at all the restaurants. We ate twice at The Boat Landing. Get the Taco Salad with Kahlua Pork. . . Fish Taco's are great too. Great view of the sunset for dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company. The Big Breakfast buffet is incredible too.Lots of different water activities/equipment rentals. Fairly reasonably priced. We did a paddle board \"excursion\" which was a led by a member of the lagoon staff. It was $40 for 45 minutes. It took us out of the lagoon and into the bay out past Budda Point. This included the paddle board rental. Beware the trained parrots with the photographers. I had my picture taken with one on the beach, and it tried to eat my diamond earring. Luckily he dropped it, and after a few minutes of searching, the photographer found it in the sand. ", " beautiful resort, restaurants very good , it's a big resort but quiet ", " I absolutely loved this place. It was a perfect holiday retreat with perfect views of the ocean! My favorite part was whale watching at Buddah Point and paddle boarding excursions with the sport rental staff right there in the lagoon. This is definately a family friendly place with everything right there for kids of all ages. Everyone at the resort encompassed the true feeling of the aloha spirit. You are in walking distance to the grocery store, Queens Market, and dining options near Kings Market. And the shuttle was really convenient as well if you didn't want to do the 1 mile walk. The resort is really big, but it was nice to walk around and check out the sights.I cannot wait to go back to the Big Island and take the whole family. ", " We are so lucky and get to go to the Big Island every year. My mother and father in law have a house here and we always stay here. Just for fun we decided to stay a night at the Hilton. We had the best time. The restaurants we great, my daughter and niece did the dolphin swim, my sister and I enjoyed the happy hour by the pool. Honestly an amazing stay! ", " Room 6330 the best room in the house.KPC have excellent food.I had a nice time enjoying the resort. Two nights and three days was enough time to enjoy the resort. ", " 1) You can relax and have your entire vacation without leaving the giant property2) Kids will love the sleek train and scenic boat rides as well as the kids camps3) Free lessons like hula and aquahula are not to be missed. I went to three luaus and this one put the others to shame! 4) Fun Imu preparation (where they get the pig ready to cook for the luau) early in morning5) The Lagoon is like a dream where you can swim within inches of real sea turtles with no current working against youI can't wait to go back! ", " We stayed here for our Honeymoon back in 2005, and the resort was amazing. We now have kids and planning to make it our regular family holiday destination. I can't seem to find anywhere else that compares...it's so large, that even as Honeymooners, we had no idea of the huge kids/family facilities at the other end of the resort. Now with kids it seems like the best Resort in Hawaii with waterslides, caves, bridges, dolphins, turtles, waterfalls, hammocks and the boat or train that connects you from one end to the other is even fun! I've never been one for large resorts, but this is just so big and has everything, that you don't even feel like you are in a big resort...it's a large village. We dined at most of the restaurants and was impressed, drank at the bars which were great. When our kids are old enough we'll be sure to pre book them for the swim with the dolphin option too - looked great! ", " I think there is no other place to stay on the island. I had not stayed anywhere else but based on the sights and areas we visitied this is truly the place to go. We had an ocean front view on the 6th floor in the Ocean tower and all I can say is wow. We had a perfect view of the sunset and we turned off the AC and just kept the patio door open to get the breeze and the sounds of the waves crashing all day and night. This place also sports a million things to do from its multiple pools and hot tubs, snorkeling, some white sand beaches on property, water activities on property, shopping, dining, dolphin adventure, and much much more. This place is so huge that they have a boat and tram option to get around which is super helpful. There is also so many things to look at and plenty of pictures are taken of this place that are probably in people's photo albums all over the world.We also went to their Luau and it was out of this world. It also helped that we were front and center (Tip for you, ask to sit at table 3 and sit closest to the stage. You may miss the fashion show because your back is toward the stage but once the show gets going, the food is pretty much done. So turn your seat around and be prepared for spears going over your head.)After reading some of the reviews and especially those saying its missing the umph, I can see this happeing depending on where your room is and what activities you do on the resort. We did a ton of things both on and off the resort and I will say that this resort was quite the highlight of our stay and definitely not going to be the local Hawaiian experience. With all the respect to the Big Island, I think if you are a city dweller, you will appreciate the amenities this resort offers after a day/night out on Mona Kea, volcano tour or waterfall adventure. The true highlight of this place FOR ME was the service that I was also given by the Waikoloa Hilton staff. Stefan Tomm went out of his way to make sure our experience was memorable. Everything we did here would not have been as incredible had it not been for the personal touch he provided. Read my review for KPC as well and you will see a really solid pattern of service from the folks at this place. Their efforts have been crucial to my overall positive review of this resort.The biggest suggestion that I have for those that decide to visit this place would be to reach out to the folks that work here. Not Hilton customer service located elsewhere on the planet. The folks that work here are more than willing to help make your experience perfect. They wont know however unless you reach out to them.Hats off to the Hilton Waikoloa Village staff and thanks for the wonderful memories. ", " My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in early November during our trip to the Big Island. We spent a total of 4 nights and absolutely loved our time here.I will say this first - if your flight arrives in the late evening (like ours did), make sure you get food before coming to the resort. After 9 or 10 PM, all that's available is room service. And, on the island, it's difficult to find places open past 8 or 9 PM. We found a Domino's Pizza that was South of the airport about 5 - 7 miles, ordered pizza, and ate that in the hotel room.When we arrived, we were quickly greeted by the valet, who took care of all our bags and our vehicle. Every morning, our vehicle was quickly retrieved and they always asked where/what we were doing for the day and gave tips and recommendations on where to go and what to see. The valet folks were especially helpful.Check-in was a breeze. Being a Diamond member with Hilton allowed us to get a number of vouchers good toward food/drinks on the property.We had to wait about 6 - 8 minutes for the tram to finally show up. The trams run fewer times in the night than during the day. We finally boarded the tram and went to our room, located in the Lagoon tower. The room was very nice and large, with a balcony and view of the ocean. There were no signs of wear and tear or \"tired\" looking furniture or rugs. Shortly after we arrived to our room, our luggage came as well.The bellman noticed that our door was very difficult to open. I had noticed that too, but wasn't too concerned about it. The bellman voluntarily offered to have someone come in the morning and have it checked. Sure enough, the next afternoon when we returned from our day of adventure, the door was fixed and there was a cheese and fruit plate on our desk, apologizing for the inconvenience. My wife and I were very impressed, given that we didn't really complain about it in the first place.The only downside we noticed with staying in the lagoon tower was that every morning between the hours of 5 AM - 7 AM, we'd hear this shrieking noise outside our door - getting up and opening the door, we realized the noise was from the (probably thousands) of birds in the courtyard area that were getting up in the morning and making noise. The noises just echoed throughout the courtyard area, so its very very loud - and I'm a pretty heavy sleeper. I will say that we didn't see a lot of birds everywhere, but I'm guessing they're in the many trees that are in the courtyard area. Nonetheless, it was our daily alarm! Every morning we had breakfast buffet on the property. It's a very large, extensive buffet with an assortment of Japanese and American dishes. It also overlooks the lagoon area, so its nice view. This buffet has so many fruits, juices, japanese dishes, pastries, meats, and bread to choose from. They also have a made-to-order omelet bar, which typically has a line. We stuffed ourselves with this breakfast buffet, which meant we could be out and about until 2 - 3 PM without really feeling hungry. I would highly recommend that so you don't have to worry as much about stopping/finding a place to eat on the island.We didn't try their spa, but have heard great things from others. ", " WOW...what other hotel can you check-in and proceed to your room via Boat, Rail or walk!!! Incredibly beautiful grounds and just a very comfortable hotel. A great place to stay if you want to see the BIG Island or if you just want to Chill and do nothing. I highly recommend this hotel in Hawaii's Big Island. ", " this resort has everything . you can spend a whole vacation here and never leave . the only thing missing is a nice sandy beach . there is a beach walking distance and there are several beach's a short drive away . this should be a beautiful place for a wedding . By far is not budget friendly . if you want to go the cheaper route you need to rent a condo . ", " What a fantastic resort this place is! Absolutely loved it, and most definitely want to go back! Went with a large family group - we had 4 rooms (2 pairs of adjoining) on the ground floor in the Ocean Tower just beside the Kohala River Pool - a perfect spot! We just spent one night but enjoyed every moment from time of arrival and trip on the tram, to the beautiful sunset, and the next day's exploring, swimming, and playing with the variety of water toys available in the lagoon pool. ", " It was our annual homage back to the Big Island and the Hilton Waikoloa. Still love this place.Every year as our son gets older, he experiences new things here. This hotel has activities for every age. Our room was upgraded to ocean front, since we are HHonor members. I was leery about being on the ground floor but it turned out we essentially had a front lawn to run around on. The pools and slides are still is big draw for us and they did not disappoint. The grounds are still fabulous. Did get lots of exercise. Liked the newly refabbed, pool side, Orchid Market to serve a big variety of grab-and-go food. We purchased the meal discount card and saved 10% off of our meals. Enjoyed the free ice cream, arm band collection as well. We stayed for 3 days and didn't wander off anywhere. The rooms were big but, I admit are looking a tad used - granted we did get an amazing daily rate. Enjoyed the staff at Imari as well as the food (ate there twice). Loved the atmosphere of Kamuela Provision Com, but having eaten there, before, we felt the cuts of meat weren't up to your usual outstanding standards. Did purchase a gallon of your coco-mango moisturizer. Hope it lasts til we are there again next year. The perfume of it, takes me back to my happy place. ", " This is a huge property requiring tram, boat, or a long walk to traverse in about 20 minutes. Very well landscaped, beautiful buildings, convenient to many spots on the west side of the big island. One of a few places in the world to swim with dolphins is on the hotel grounds. The buffet breakfast was a very good mix of familiar, tropical, and oriental foods. Lots of salt water activities on the shallow private lagoon. ", " My wife, daughter and myself chose this Hilton for 2011 summer vacation. Yes, its expensive, very expensive. We got a package deal that included breakfast and 2/drinks a day, I would recommend this if you can get it. We had a fabulous time, truly an unforgettable trip. The hotel grounds are beautiful, well kept with manicured displays, Asian influenced artwork and sculptures and the grounds are cleaned continuously. Service is so-so, below par for an upscale hotel, but that seems to be the norm in Hawaii (think ISLAND TIME!) But everyone was very nice. If you are a demanding type of person \u201c like I AM A DIAMOND CLUB MEMBER!!!\u201d \u2026then this probably isn\u2019t where you will be satisfied staying. It's a large resort, complete with a boat and monorail to take you from one end of the resort to the other. Our room was average, with a perfect view of the dolphins, lagoon and ocean. We planned on spending as little time as possible in the room, but it was clean, spacious enough and the bed was VERY comfortable. We loved walking everywhere, because of the fantastic weather, great sites, art and something to see around every corner, like the rare sightings of what we believe was a mongoose! We did the dolphin experience, and while my 7-year old was in heaven, it was a complete rip-off, outrageously priced, but booked solid with customers?- it is basically a wade-in and pet the dolphin for a lot of money. In Mexico, for example you spend twice as much time for 1/3 of the cost and get a true interaction - this is nothing more than a wet petting zoo with $50 extra to buy the picture at the end... The lagoon was great - we swam/snorkeled every day, with lots of sea turtles, exotic fish and eels to see - impressive!. It is a man-made white-sand beach at the lagoon and its great, bring your own mask if you have one. The lagoon grill (burgers/pizza) and the bar-food was the best and best-value at the Hilton, overall I was disappointed with the food in Hawaii period - not just at the hotel, but everywhere we went... Bubba Gumps, Tommy Bahamas, Macaroni Grill\u2026 al were OK, but just not what I am accustomed to in the way of taste or value. We are spoiled here in Texas with great food. A few tips - stay in the Lagoon Tower if you are on a family trip, its the closest to the largest pool with a great water slide, water fall and hot tubs, its easy access to the breakfast buffet (have Chris make you an omelet - he is the best) and close to the lagoon. Try the nachos at the bar! We attended the Luau at the Hotel next door \u2013 it was supposed to be a better value \u2013 not sure, I think either would be just fine. The Luau\u2019s are expensive, but worth attending at least once while you are there \u2013 its tradition \u2013 and the girls (my daughter and wife) were mesmerized \u2013 but hardly ate a thing as the food is more traditional and less \u201ctourist.\u201d You can rent a car at the hotel, we rented a Jeep for the two weeks we were there, but really only needed it for about 3-4 days out of the trip, probably would have been cheaper to plan the excursions and just have a rental for those days. We would definitely recommend the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a family vacation, and we plan on going back! ", " This resort is beautiful. They have boat rides to take you to your room. Also have snorkeling right on the property. We swam with sea turtles. Views from our room were breathtaking, Rooms were very nice. We loved everything about this Resort. ", " Awesome/Stellar - seriously, I travel virtually every week on business, stay in great hotels all over the US and abroad and this stay was just amazing. The rennovated rooms were exceptional and the property looks very sharp (and it is quite large). A great value, a wonderful experience and one that will make the other 5 star hotels in the area jealous.Food - there is a great Roy's down the street and also the ABC store in the King's Shops has a great wine collection. Enjoy! ", " This was our 4th visit to this hotel as it is a beautiful setting with lots of fun things to do. The grounds are extensive, and there is a monorail and boats (although the latter were out of service for canal repairs during our visit) to get people around. The walk from one end to the other passes a wide variety of artwork, under a cover that is open on one side. Even with the transportation, we did a lot of walking. There is a sheltered lagoon where one can snorkel or use a variety of boats. A wide variety of colorful fish swim in from the ocean. While we were there, we saw 3 sea turtles. There are also tennis courts, two extensive swimming pools, and a couple of fun water slides. One restaurant, the Kamuela Provision Company, sits on a point with great views of the sunset and excellent fish dishes. There are also Japanese and Chinese restaurants.Complaints: not enough eating options, since the cafe and the Italian restaurant were closed during our visit. Prices are high for almost everything. We resent the parking fee, even if you self park in lots that are a ways from the entrance. Getting the car to go elsewhere takes time. It is hard to get there without a car. ", " We have stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa 3 separate times. The property is enormous with so many activities that you never have to leave the resort. Rooms are very spacious in each of the 3 towers. (Lagoon, Palace, and Ocean). If you want to be secluded, the Ocean tower is the furthestIt from the main lobby and boasts the Adults-only pool. There are MANY excellent restaurants throughout the property and all are excellent. HIlton offers many deals and will often run a free Luau promotion. The resort is geared toward families. It has a huge lagoon with watersport activities and even has dolphins. You can book a package to swim with the dolphins. It's pricey, but very much worth it. (A lagoon tower, lagoon view room and you can see them from your balcony.) We were married in the chapel in 2010. It will continue to be one of our favorite places to stay in all of Hawaii. ", " This is a very large resort on the west side of the island (30 minutes north of Kona). Since this sde of the island gets very little rain, you can pretty much count on having great weather.We flew in to Hilo. It is a 2 hour drive to the resort. It is not a bad drive, but not much to see from the road. When we arrived, self parking was full so they gave us valet parking for no additional charge. After the first night, we chose to self park our car. There is really no other option for parking in the area. It is about 150 yard walk to the lobby (depending on where you park). It was about anohter 1/4 mile to our room in the Ocean Tower. There is a tram or canal boat that runs through the resort if you don't mind waitng for them. There is a sign showing you how long until the next train. This made it convenient to decide if we waited or not.As I said, this is a very large resort. I believe it is 60-65 acres. There are three towers. Lagoon Towers is probably the closest to everything. The Palace Tower is in the middle. And the Ocean Tower is furthest from the lobby. We stayed in the Ocean Tower. The room was very large and comfortable. We had a balcony that overlooked the ocean. There is a safe in the room for valuables and a small refridgerator for drinks and snacks.The resort has several swimming pools. Although the water is cold, I found it to be nice. There is a nice water slide in the large pool. There is no true beach area. The resort made a lagoon area and put in a man made beach. There are several restaurants onthe property. Since we are Hilton Diamond members, we received discount vouchers for the restaurants. The snack shop was the best value, but still a little pricey. We also ate at the Chineese and Italian restaurants. Again, a little pricey. The food was good, but not excellent.I would recommend a car if staying here. You could easily spend the week at the resort, but why not go see the island. There is shopping and restaurants near the resort. Other than that, everything is 30 minutes to 2.5 hours away. We did a lot of driving.I liked the resort and would go back. Just be aware that it is large. Plan on a lot of walking or waiting for the tram. When we were there, the resort was sold out due to a conference. Even with the number of people there, it did not seem crowded at all. That is one advantage of being so large. ", " Great resort spread over 62 acres. I booked it so that my little one would have fun going to his room on a train or a boat. It has a disney feel to it. If you have small kids, this is the place for them. There are 3 towers to stay: Lagoon, Palace and Ocean towers (ocean being the farthest away and Lagoon being the closest. We were at the Palace tower and it was a 10 min walk to the lobby but we enjoyed it as we got our exercise that way. The walkway by the way is almost as if you are walking in a museum. If you have trouble walking then either stay at Lagoon towers or wait for a train that may take 10 mins sometimes. Room was nice with a balcony and a refrigerator. Does not have a microwave and we paid 25$ for it. Restaurants have different categories: so you can eat at the one that fits your budget. We ate at the Lagoon grill and found their menu to be decent.There are plenty of pools spread all over the property. We went to the slide area with a small lazy river close to the Palace tower and also to the small lagoon area which has paddle boats, small kayak rentals and snorkeling rentals. You can also book a dolphin encounter close to this lagoon area. Has 2 golf courses. I did not plan to play and so did not bring my clubs and had to buy a glove, balls, rent clubs and played 9 holes at Beach course for 160 $. Cheaper to play at Waikoloa village golf course if you are looking for a bargain ", " I don't go luxury often, but did it this time with an American Airlines vacation package since it wasn't that much more than staying at the \"cheaper\" hotels in Kailua-Kona. I got one of the golf course rooms facing rooms on the first floor in the Ocean Tower next to the coffee shop. Aside from hearing the clanging of the metal window as the coffee shop was opened at 0600, the room was great (considering the deal I got). The room was beautiful and clean. The rooms were relatively sound proof and I did not hear my neighbors at all. The resort was huge and had both a train and a boat to get people from building to building. The Ocean Tower is the furthest tower from the front lobby, so the train was particularly helpful when moving in. The $25/day resort fee and $24.99 buffet breakfast were included in the deal I got from American Airlines, so, no unexpected fees. Self park was $15 per day. The resort fee includes access to all 4 beautiful pools (2 with water slides and 1 adults only pool), 2 putt-putt rounds daily, 2 drinks per room daily, wired internet in the rooms and wireless in the common spaces, and 1/2 rentals. Snorkel gear was $3.50 for 1 hour with the discount. The hotel's lagoon was gorgeous and they allow you to take the snorkel gear out to the ocean (which connects to the lagoon). There are always sea turtles in the lagoon and many varieties of fish. It is a short walk/drive to the beach in A-bay (Anaehoomalu). Kings and Queens Marketplaces are also near the resort for high-end shopping. It's about 30 minutes to the airport and 40 minutes to downtown Kailua-Kona. Because of the location, this is usually one of the dryest parts of the island. To the north about 30 minutes away are two separate accesses to the Waipio Valley. Hardest thing to do from this resort is to get to Hawaii Volcanos National Park. It is about 2 1/2 hours there. If you wait for night time to see the lava glow, you probably won't get back to the hotel until 10 or 11 pm (unless you hike out to the lava--then you may not get back until after midnight). It is about 3 hours to Hilo from here as well. I've also stayed at the Grand Wailea on Maui and would consider this a better hotel overall considering the wide ranging activities available right at the hotel. Had a great time! ", " This is our fifth trip to the HWV, so obviously we must find some things to like about it. Other reviews are accurate in that:-There is no wide open beach with surf to play in-The food is expensive at the resort restaurants.-It takes a while to get from your room to your car due to the long walks, tram or boat rides.That said, there is no better place on the island to stay if you are traveling with children of any age. There is so much to do on the resort and it is so large with unique features that never makes it feel crowded and your kids would have to be major league tools if they get bored here. For couples, this place is fantastic around sunset and later and probably one of the most romantic settings you can imagine. The staff seemed to be the happiest, friendliest and most eager to serve that I have seen in the past ten years. I am not sure if there is new management, but there certainly is a great attitude and vibe. In particular, Jennifer at the front desk was friendly and efficient and secured for us a lovely room with an unforgettable view.If you are crabby, cheap or thrifty, don't like to walk, don't like children, are afraid of feral cats or dolphins, this is not the place for you.  If you do select this resort, here are a few tips:Tower Choice: There are three buildings to choose from; Lagoon, Palace and Ocean. The size and quality of the rooms are the same in all towers. Beds are comfortable, and the place is very clean. There is a certain ambiance and convenience that is unique to each tower, so here's my take:Lagoon Tower: The closest to the entrance/main lobby/spa and health club. This one is an easy walk from the main lobby, though the trams and boats both serve this tower. It overlooks Dolphin Quest so you may be able to see dolphins outside your window. It is closest to the big pool area where the big water slide/falls/hot tubs are. It is also closest to spa and tennis courts. The only downside is that twice a day, an enormous flock of birds screech in the center courtyard to a Hitchcock-esque level. No, seriously these birds are extremely loud around happy hour and in the morning.Palace Tower: Situated halfway between the lobby and the Ocean towers, we've stayed here once. It is much quieter, there are no pools very close by. If you don't like the sight, smell or sound of children, this may be your best bet. It is close to the Asian themed restaurants. If will be a bit of walk to pools and bars.Ocean: This seems like the largest tower complex and furthest from the lobby. There is some great landscaping and fun places nearby. There is an \"adults only\" pool (no one gets nekked, its just a quiet place without kids around.) There is also a great pool area for kids, though not as large as the area near lagoon, but the pools are a little warmer with some fun waterslides and kiddy pools for the smaller kids. There is a lazy river, but it is so lazy that it doesn't move at all. \"Club Keiki\" is in ocean tower which is a supervised kids program. There is also a fun bar at the boat landing which is recently renovated into Mexican food & drink. I would think Ocean would be great for families with kids.A few other considerations: The Lagoon area pool is a hypothermia-inducing 72 degrees -I had to know so I measured it. For some reason, kids can deal with this just fine, but adults don't seem to stay in too long. The pool near Ocean Tower is 74 degrees. -This doesn't sound like a big difference, but really it is more comfortable there. As a comparison, the ocean beaches measure about 78. I am not sure why the pools are colder than the ocean, but they are. They seem very clean, however the cold pool water leads to a lot of kids piled into the spas/hot tubs. The color or the water and my aversion to Cholera kept me from using the hot tubs. In the locker rooms at the spa, they have beautiful lava rock spas and steam rooms. They are clean and very relaxing compared to the ones near the pools.Every room now has a small fridge which is great to help keep eating/snacking costs down. The queens shops have a gourmet grocery store where you can stock up, or maybe even stop at the Safeway in Kona.The boats during our visit over Christmas break only ran from 2:30 to 10 PM. Not a big deal, but I really like the boats. We grab a drink and make a few loops in floating happy hour before dinner and during sunset. -Gorgeous!By tradition, at sunset, a young man in traditional native attire, blows a conch shell in front of the Kamuela restaurant and runs through the resort lighting all the tiki torches. For some reason, the ladies seem to love this. -Don't miss it.The only thing I am seriously irritated about it is the removal of hammocks from the grounds. There used to be a bunch around the lagoon and Buddha point. Now there is just one near the lagoon. The hammocks were one of the best things about the grounds; I can't think they are expensive to buy or maintain, so why the removal??Enjoy! ", " Spent Dec. 16-23 at the Hilton and loved it. At first we pretty much had the place to ourselves and it was lovely and peaceful. Didn't start to get crowded until the 23rd. Had our best meal at KPC. Excellent food, service and an atmosphere and view that could not be more beautiful. The Japanese place, Imari, was horrible. Roy's at the King's Marketplace had excellent, expensive food, but the ambiance was noisy and boring. It sits on a golf course and pond, but you can't see that at night. Was very windy for most of the trip. Attempted to go to the beach twice, Hapuna and Mauna Kea, but had to leave after being pummeled by sand, even in the morning. Too bad because these were stunning beaches. We also visited A bay right near the resort to watch the sunset and Kealakekua Bay (south of Kona and a bit of a drive), both lovely places. We had a wonderful room in the Lagoon Tower overlooking the dolphin pool, ocean and lagoon. Had coffee on the lanai every morning and it was incredible. The room was plenty spacious for my husband, teenage daughter and I. Large walk in closet! The birds coming in at night were very noisy, but really cool! They didn't bother me or wake me up in the morning. Yes, the pool water was frigid, and the wind didn't help, but I went to the Queen's marketplace and bought a wetsuit jacket and it was great for the pool and the ocean. The lagoon is the perfect place to teach anyone how to snorkel and there are lots of fish and even turtles to look at in a safe environment. The service everywhere we went in this resort was top notch and very friendly. Several people staying at the resort told us not to bother with the volcano, so we didn't. Our daughter didn't want to sit in the car for three or four hours and neither did we. Yes, the resort is HUGE, but after awhile I figured out where all the elevators were and how to cut the trips shorter so it wasn't too bad, but still exhausting. It was worth it though! We saved a lot of money by bringing our own booze and making cocktails in our room, but splurged on those darn chocolate banana smoothies by the pool for our daughter and a few good mai tai's for ourselves. The Orchid Marketplace and Lagoon Grill have decent food that is still overpriced, but ok, especially for the kids. Bring one of those coolers that folds flat or buy one when you get there. The little market at the Queen's Marketplace is like a small Whole Foods and ABC store put together and has delicious muffins and a great deli where you can get just about anything. We also ate a few meals at the food court there and it was pretty good. We've done all the expensive excursions on other islands, and for this trip just wanted to sit at the resort, and this was the perfect place to do that. Once I got there I didn't want to leave! Its one of the few places I have been that were actually better in person than the beautiful pictures on the websites. ", " I sent a compliment the staff for the polite and helpful service we received. I asked for a room change after our first night. We had been upgraded to the garden level room but the only way to have the door open was to have only the screen door closed for privacy and security. I didn't like having the door to the patio shut at night as I wanted to hear the wind and waves. I called early the next morning and was assured that we would have our room changed during the day while we were visiting the volcano. We checked with the front desk on our return at 9 PM and found that we weren't moved. The nice man at the desk on Thursday evening, looked for a room that had a king size non-smoking room on the same side of the lagoon tower but was unable to find one. We spent the night in the first room, a bit miffed that we had completely packed up to be moved and crossed our fingers again with sleeping with only the screen door shut. The next morning, we called the special line and were lined up with a new room within the hour. I loved the 5th floor room over the dolphin pool and really enjoyed the view, the ability to leave the screen door as the only door closed at night and got a real kick out of the birds that nest in the courtyard. I have a friend who loves birds and I called her as they were settling in for the evening. She was tickled to hear the sound of the birds. They converse for about an hour at sunset and wake early, before sunrise. I could only hear them standing next to the door inside the room but the courtyard was alive with their wonderful conversation. We had a lovely stay and really appreciated the extra service from the staff when I dropped my cell phone down the elevator shaft. The staff had it rescued and quickly mailed it to me. The breakfast at the coffee shop at the lagoon had a nice combo of breakfast sandwich and coffee (quite good coffee) that was quite filling, was around $10. We are Hilton Diamond members and were given $10 vouchers for each day of the stay so this fit most of our breakfasts. Dinner with the pumpkin lobster soup at KFC was plenty for supper, it is a huge bowl and absolutely delicious. Snorkeling in the lagoon was fun and the fish are plentiful. Walking about the resort was nice as the views of the ocean are great from the walking paths and it is nice to see the resort. We were very happy to stay and really enjoyed our time. ", " We spent a week at this beautiful resort hotel while attending a conference. The grounds were immaculate and the service was fantastic. Check was quick and smooth. The staff were courteous through out. Be prepared for the price though. Everything was quite expensive, especially the dining (beware of the breakfast buffet!). Fortunately, the rooms were equipped with coffee maker and fridge, so we could stock up at the nearby grocery and enjoy a nice dinner every evening. The pools, lagoon, and beach provided a variety of settings from high density family settings around the pool to quiet areas for adult relaxation to almost secluded setting at the northeast end of the property near the golf course. Our favorite. ", " Stayed at the Hilton Waikaloa Village in Kona, Big Island, Hawaii in November of 2010. It was a romantic get away for my girlfriend and I. We had an absolutely great time. The resort was picturesquely beautiful and the staff couldn't have been any nicer. The pools are great, as is the transportation that gets you around the resort. We ate at several of the restaurants, which were excellent. Our first night there was my girlfriends birthday, so we at at KPC. I made reservations about a week ahead, so we had a table right on the ocean at sunset. It couldn't have been any nicer. The only downside to the whole trip was the concierge recommended taking the \"volcano\" tour. That ended up being terrible and an incredible waste of time and money. It was all day, a ridiculous amount of driving and only got to see lava from so far away that it only looked like a glow. Do not waste your time. However, we did do the snorkel tour on the Fairwind II and that was great!All in all, we would return to the Hilton Waikaloa in a heartbeat. It was awesome! ", " We booked through AAA and got adjoining rooms with a suite in the Ocean Tower - together it was three rooms, two bathrooms, two balconies and probably 1500 sf of BEAUTIFUL living space. Yes it was expensive, but I don't think we will ever see finer accommodations. I want to live there. We were there for six days and my kids would have been happy swimming in the pools and lagoon every day. It was a struggle wrestling them away to see the rest of Big Island. The lagoon in particular was a real draw - the whole family loved snorkling, paddle surfing, even riding the water bike around the property among the tropical fish and sea turtles. Even with our freespending ways we couldn't in good conscience pay the $200+ to swim with the dolphins, but it was still fun to watch them train. Food is expensive and mediocre but what do you expect? The Big Island Breakfast buffet was the best food we experienced on property, but expensive unless you get an inclusive deal - without the vouchers included in our promotion it would have cost over $100 each day to feed our family. (If you are looking for a good off-campus breakfast spot, ask the concierge for directions to the Kau Kau Shack in Waikoloa Village - you will not be disappointed.) So many activities we couldn't do them all. Great place, and we made memories that will last a lifetime. ", " I stayed at The Hilton Waikoloa Village for 8 nights starting on 11/8/11.Checkin went smoothly.I stayed in the Lagoon Tower overlooking the Kona pool.I was also able to see the dolphin lagoon.The room had a king sized bed and a sofa.The bed was very comfortable.There was a coffee maker & a mini-fridge in the room.Coffee was very good.Food was expensive but I expected that.The breakfast buffet was $30 and the food was just ok.There is a place next to the Lagoon Grill where you can get breakfast at a decent price.The KPC restaurant overlooks the water and the food was very good . The Chinese resaurant was not very good although eating outside was nice.There is a market at the Queen's shops where you can get food to keep in the room which helps cut down the cost.If you don't have a car the shuttle costs $2 each way.I think it would about 15min to walk there.The shuttle also stops at the Marriott hotel where there is a beach although I never went there.The hotel consists of 3 towers which can be reached by a monorail tram or the boats which had just started running again just before I left.There is a pool by the Lagoon tower & also a man made beach where people went snorkeling.There are some pretty big turtles and fish in the lagoon.The Ocean tower has an adult pool & a regular pool.It is quieter over in the Ocean tower but it is also further away from the lobby & the Lagoon tower where most activities take place.The Mahalo lounge is also in the Lagoon Tower & is the only bar besides the pool bars.People complain that the hotel is too big but there are some very nice paths for walking.You do have to make sure that when you leave your room you have everything you need.There was artwork all along the walkways between the towers.I was very happy with the service I received.I did not leave the hotel but there are many activities to do on the island.I was told that the hotel will be undergoing a total gut renovation starting with the Lagoon tower in April of 2012 over a 2year period.I am going back in March of 2012 & am looking forward to seeing some of the great staff I encountered during my stay. ", " Had the best time with my wife at the Hilton Waikoloa Village! If you go, you have to hang out at the Lagoon Grill Bar. Lawrence, Kerwin, Randy, and the rest of the bartenders are super fun and they are top notch bartenders. Great place to be during football season. After a boat drink or two. just look around you and you'll never want to leave... ", " This is an amazing resort. We had a fantastic buffet breakfast as part of a B&B package. Our ocean-front room had a superb view of the ocean. We only had four nights, so we stayed on-site for all of it, except for a snorkel cruise because it is difficult to find beaches nearby. Snorkeling in the lagoon is pretty limited. All-in-all, a great stay! ", " On this occasion we stayed at the Hilton in order to not have to drive home to Hilo after seeing REO Speedwagon in the Hilton Ballroom...I arose early leaving my partner asleep, to explore this vast property more than I have in the past brief visits...as the Espresso machine was not working at the Ocean Tower end of the Train line I took the train to the far end....my impression of the train....it is WAY too slow and stops for way too long while passing its opposite number...but it is effective for the older crowd..they should get the Shanghai Chinese Maglev people in there and creat a REAL experience...but I digress...After good coffee and a nice selection of breakfast items at the southern end of the line I walked past the Flamingo's, the Nene Geese and other critters and followed the paved path to the descending stairs to the coastal trail south toward the Marriot...this is a VERY nice walk and will bring you to Anaihoomalu Bay ( A Bay ) which suffered some interesting damage in the Japanese Tsunami aftermath...turning around I retraced my steps to the Hilton and sticking close to the coast transited the entire property with fascinating vignettes of other guest, suspension bridges, dolphins, kayakers and the whole Hilton AMAZING landscaping, pools waterfalls and sheer whimsey...you will eventually exit the property to the north by a serene Buddha on a dedicated coastal access trail that goes for miles...The Hilton is situated in a \"Village\" in which bikes of various grades are available....up to Ironman grade $2500 jobs...My advise if you are outdoors types and enjoy walking is, get to the Hilton without a car and spend a few days exploring the Hotel and its surroundings....once you get a car the grass on the other side will seem greener and you wont give it its due... ", " This was a great hotel to stay at . Stayed there from Oct 11 to Oct 13th 2011. We were in the Ocean Tower with a great view, Highly recommend ", " We just completed a family vacation that started with four nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island and later 3 nights on Maui. There were 10 people on this trip of various ages coming from different parts of the U.S. We all LOVED the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Our first impresssion was the main lobby which was open on two sides allowing for a gentle ocean breeze to come through. We were all completely relaxed by the sweet ocean air within 5 minutes. The front desk staff, the valet guys, room service, and all the waiters and waitresses addressed me by name and were very courteous to the entire family. We felt welcome here.The resort is HUGE! 62 acres on the ocean. Hilton Waikoloa Village is on the northwest side of the Big Island, also known as Hawaii. This side of the island is great because they dont get too much rain and the weather is fantastic year round. The Big Island is roughly the size of Connecticut and is interesting to explore. The east side has a tropical rainforest and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The property is connected by a tram that makes 4 stops and runs every 15-20 minutes or so. It is not a bad walk to go from one end all the way to the other. They have a beautiful Asian art exhibit in the corridor that connects all the resort areas, which makes the walk very pleasant. There is so much to do at the resort! The pools are amazing, especially the main pool. You can swim with dolphins here. There are multiple restaurants. The breakfast is fantastic, especially the fruit. I have never had papayas or pineapple this good before. There are nice canopy covered lawn chairs that overlook the beach and the ocean. It is a great spot for watching the sunset.We signed up for a volcano combo tour which was very comprehensive. The tour picked us up at 7am and dropped us back at 10:30pm. This is a long time to spend on a tour van, but we saw a lot. The tour made a number of stops, we got some great photos of Kilauea. We also saw Hilo, hiked through the rainforest, walked through a lava tube and saw some of the most amazing nature on planet earth. Hawaii is paradise. I don't want to overstate my experience, but this was the vacation of a lifetime for me. Part of it was due to sharing time with family, and part of it was due to the fantastic Hilton Waikoloa Village. It is hard not to be happy here. ", " We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of a three week holiday in Oahu and the Big Island. This was our relax and do little time at the end of touring and was perfect for this purpose - personally I would not stay here if my intention was to be out exploring the Big Island every day - but it is a great place if your intention is to stay mainly in and around the resort. The resort is huge with its own lagoon complete with visiting turtles, multiple pools and water slides, a dolphin encounter area, and mutitude of dining options. Our 4 year old thought the train that runs through the resort was fantastic and even if you do like walking it is nice to have another option to get back to your room after a long hot day. We stayed in the Ocean Tower with beautiful views of the ocean and resort in a very clean and comfortable room. It is a hotel with fantastic amenities - and as I think is usual, the food and other prices are accordingly high. You are paying for the wonderful pools, lagoon, landscaping, boats and tram so if this is just a place to stay whilst exploring Hawaii then you will not get good value for money. If you want to stay mostly in the resort and enjoy days by the pool and building sandcastles, then this resort is perfect and the staff will do everything they can do help you have a great vacation. ", " The most beautiful resort I have ever stayed in. It has 3 towers and its own private tram taking you from one to the plus reception. If you prefer a more romantic mean of transportation, the resort also offers a boats to take you from one place to another. The main pools and the lagoons, all have nicely engineered waterfalls. My travel was business and vacation, 10 days in all. For business, the ethernet internet connection was not the best, at times even frustrating. The beds are at the soft end of the spectrum, and for two nights in a row a low frequency noise woke us up. It sounded like an engine noise. We reported this issue and we were told that is water in the pipe and there is nothing they can do. We had a car rented and several nights in a row was very difficult to find a parking spot even though the charge is 15 per day. I would say these were the only negatives about the entire experience. The staff was very friendly, the room big and clean. We asked for the fridge replacement, kettle, wine bottle opener, and had prompt response from staff. Would definitely go there again and perhaps this time just stay in the resort, enjoying every A tip about restaurants, yes indeed the prices tend to be high,but one place that is a great value for your money is the Lagoon Bar Grill. We discovered it the day before leaving and enjoyed our meal there. The Korean chicken and the spring rolls with mint... absolutely fantastic! The Mai Tai had more rhum than all the cocktails we have had for the entire week. ", " Fabulous location with gorgeous panoramic views! The hotel is a resort well suited to couples, families, and groups. The ocean-view rooms are worth the upgrade as the sparkling aqua waters and palm trees refresh one's soul! Be sure to take a beach bag and plan on spending time relaxing pool-side at one of the several pools, or on the sandy beach at the dolphin area. This hotel has several restaurant options as well - the grill overlooking the lagoon offers good burgers. There is a Costco near the airport and farm markets in Kailua-Kona that offer fresh flowers and produce at reasonable prices to pick up before going to the hotel (the rooms have a small refrigerator). ", " We loved this resort. We stayed in the lagoon tower and our balcony had a beautiful view of the lagoon, dolphin quest, and the ocean. The room was very large, and was very clean. We saw many turtles in the lagoon and enjoyed the ocean front path. There were many great places to watch sunset. The pool is beautiful and there were always plenty of lounge chairs to choose from. The service was excellent across the board. You could easily spend your entire trip on the property, but beware -- the restaurants are pricey, even by Hawaii standards. Also, this is definitely a family hotel, so if lots of little kids are going to bother you, you may want to try somewhere else. ", " Three years ago my wife and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in an Ocean Front Room which was fabulous.Actually, we loved the place so much that we decided to come and stay there again - and this time we brought our two teenaged daughters along..What can we say? It was a perfect vacation in a most gorgeous resort:We upgraded to the extravagant presidential suite, which had two huge bedrooms, two gigantic bathrooms, two saunas, a vast terrace overlooking the whole village and bay and a monumental living room with an amazing grand piano in the middle !!!The breakfast buffet was amazing: it was so big and delicious, that we could hardly lift ourselves from the table :-)It included everything breakfast usually includes plus the fantastic tropical fruits of Hawaii.One can easily spend a whole week in the hotel without wanting to get out: wonderful pools, numerous restaurants, water sports and dolphins, golf, tennis, spa and a state of the art gym.They have free wi-fi at the lobby area.It's not a cheap stay, but everything in Hawaii isn't cheap and we love to indulge ourselves when on vacation.Although we live on the other side of the world I am sure that we'll be back again ", " We stayed at the Waikaloa Village last month for six nights. Had a fantastic room in the Lagoon Tower, facing the Ocean, with views of both the Lagoon Pool, and Dolphin Pool. The resort is huge, and you can tell who is there for the first day, because we all have our maps out, as we negotiate the different paths. But after that it is pretty simple getting around. If you love to walk in serene settings (as my wife and I do), this is a place to go. We would enjoy a drink, and walk from the Lagoon area, past the Ocean towers around sunset. A good half hour round trip. We are not big eaters, but enjoyed the grill by the Dolphin pool, and the food at the sports bar lounge near the front desk was exellant (my wife said the Chinese Chicken Salad was the best she ever had). The prices for food at the hotel are reasonable, considering you are at a major resort, and in Hawaii. However, people with families, do make a detour from the airport, and head south to Kona for a trip to costco or target, primarily for water and snacks. There is also a small outdoor shopping mall about a mile from the hotel wihich has a convenience store, as well as several fast food places.Our hotel room was a short walk to the major pools. We were there for both weekend days, and most weekdays. The pools were never crowded, and never a problem finding lounge chairs. The pool area by waterfalls, and the \"cave\" are absolutely beautiful, but on weekends this area seemed to get taken over by teenagers, and older pre-teens. By the way, my wife and I were there on our own, but really wished we had our pre-school grandkids with us. The hotel works well for all age groups.There is also a great state beach about 15 minutes up the road. It has \"real\" bathrooms, a snackbar with pretty good food and drinks, and you can rent umbrellas, chairs, and all sorts of fun stuff for the water.We chose to use the valet, and call ahead for the car. It was only 5 minutes from our room to the valet, and our car was always there. I would highly recommend it.Again, it was the location that made the trip. Our room was convenient to everything. They have a tram on the property, but it is very, very slow. If you can, it's better to walk.If you are looking for a resort to get away from it all, or to keep the kids entertained for several days, I would highly recommend this hotel. ", " For our Hawai vacation, we spent three days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The resort is massive and a little daunting initially but within hours, we were acclimated and loving every minute of our stay. The only minor complaint was fairly expensive valet parking and self-parking also has a fairly steep daily rate, around $16 or $17 a day. It's definitely not cheap to stay here so the added parking cost was unexpected.The room we stayed in was in a perfect location (Room 2330). It was ground level for the entry but one floor up on the balcony side - just a few steps from the coffee/tea/snack area, shops and a huge gift shop. The room was large with a king bad, sofa, desk, separate dressing area with fridge, walk-in closet and smallish bathroom. By the sofa was a massive glass sliding door, with screen, out to our lanai where we had a small table and two chairs. You could sit on the sofa in the room as well and look out at the view.Our view consisted of the swimming pool and ocean. It was spectacular. We really wanted to just sit on the lanai and relax the entire time.Room service was excellent, the staff was incredibly friendly and they really work to make the stay all that it's hyped-up to be. If you don't want to eat at the numerous restaurants at the resort, there are restaurants at the 2 shopping centers within 1/2 mile from the resort entrance. There were full-service restaurants, fast-food choices and a huge deli/market that was a combination touristy place but also with gourmet foods, made-to-order sandwiches, soups, wines and cheeses.We absolutely loved this resort and have begun talking about our next trip to Hawaii. We're contemplating spending far less time on Oahu and more time on the Big Island staying at the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " My husband and i stayed at this hotel in August 2011 with our two friends to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.We upgraded to an ocean front room located in the ocean tower and it was worth every penny.Our room over looked a golf course and we could lie in bed watching the palm trees and ocean -it was heaven and we could have stayed longer. The monorail which ran from the reception covered most of the huge resort so you didnt have to walk anywhere in the heat. We enjoyed meals at the japanese rrestaurant and at the chinese although the food and beverages were not cheap. The resort runs a shuttle which takes you to the nearby shopping mall which has many reasonably priced restaurants. We took an island tour to view the volcano which was amazing and also joined one of the luaua evenings which is a must if you want to see some cultural dancing. All in all i would thoroughly recommend this resort as it caters for everyone and there is lots going on if yiou want to join in. The staff were very helpful and freindly and the whole resort was spotlessly clean. In fact everything you would wish for in a hoiliday ", " We loved this hotel and everything about it. The property was kept in pristine condition. It was right on the ocean and although there was not a beach into the ocean, the Hotel has a man made salt water lagoon with a beach that you can swim, snorkel, and boat in. The pools were fabulous. Our room was in immaculate condition and it overlooked the dolphin pool. The breakfast buffet was amazing!The only drawback to staying here is that Waikoloa is about 30 minutes away from Kaliua-Kona. But it was okay because there was plenty of shopping in the mall in the same complex that the Hilton is located in and when we wanted to go to Kona, we made a full day of it.If we ever return to the Big Island, we would definitely return to this property. We loved it and was worth the $ we spent. ", " Upon entering the village we were transported to another world. The staff was very accommodating and we wanted for nothing. The resort is absolutely gorgeous! While we planned activities away from the village( ie; zipline, volcano, sunset cruise etc.), our favorite memories are of time spent at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, snorkeling, walking the scenic paths and enjoying the nightly torch lighting at sunset. The view of the sunset over Buddha Point from our ocean tower room was spectacular! Our final day was spent at the onsite spa where we were pampered prior to our departure home. We could not have picked a better place to spend our \"Honeymoon/1st Anniversary\". We will most certainly return! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is so complete, that a visitor need never leave the grounds. There are numerous pools, sitting places and walking trails so that wandering is encouraged. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. There are also several places to eat. A short walk or drive brings visitors to both The Kings' and Queen's shopping areas, where there are places to eat, bikes to rent,Starbucks. etc. The wi-fi is $7.95 per day and parking is $15 a day, which are the only drawbacks to this property. ", " I cannot say enough good things about the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. It is the most beautiful resort I have stayed in since 2004 when I last visited this property. Room 4320 is the BEST!!! View of the ocean, pools, and the Dolphin Quest. You cannot go wrong at the Resort. Even the rooms with views of the golf course are beautiful! Staff is wonderful and very nice to children.This is a place of young and old to enjoy. ", " My husband and I just came back from 7 days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island of Hawaii. We wish we were still there. The resort is absolutely beautiful! Awesome palm trees, flowers, gorgeous ocean, crashing waves, black lava rock, pools, amazing dolphins, so many interesting statues, bridges, lanai views, sunsets, sunrise, conch blower/torch lighter, the food, smiling workers always ready with an Aloha, ocean paths, waterfalls, pool slides and more! I can't stop. We especially loved walking from place to place not just to keep the pounds off after eating all the yummy food but also because it is just so beautiful. We stayed in the Ocean Tower in a 4th floor room with an ocean view..wow couldn't stop looking out at the ocean and palm trees from the lanai! YUM: Lunches-The Orchid Marketplace calzones, pizzas, sandwiches, lilikoi cupcakes; The Lagoon Grill teriyaki chicken sandwich and salad; and The Big Island Breakfast buffet with omelets, papaya, pineapple, coffee cake, oatmeal, french toast with lilikoi syrup, guava juice.The unforgettable Dolphin Encounter and Tuesday dolphin show.We hope to go back again soon! ", " The hotel and resort was wondeful could not ask for anything better . Kids and fanily loved it. Would stay there again. Luau was ok, have been to better ones. ", " I have stayed at this hotel twice. The first was back in 2007 when I won a trip to Hawaii on Wheel of Fortune and stayed 1 week on this property, and the second was in 2010. Both times were spectacular visits. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and the food was excellent. The swimming pools and the lagoon were very clean, and being able to swim with sea turtles and exotic fish in the lagoon on a daily basis was quite an experience for me.The first time I stayed there I was in the Lagoon Tower. This was personally my favorite of both towers. It was closer to all the pools and the restaurants, and it had the better views. It was also a closer walk to the lobby from the Lagoon tower.The second time I was there I was in the Ocean Tower. This tower was at the farther end of the resort property. The only reason I didn't like it cause it was a long boat ride, train ride, or walk back to the main lobby from here. Regardless of that the rooms were very clean and still offered a great view.I would recommend this to anyone who will be here. If you plan on doing a helicopter tour of the Big Island, this resort property is less then 1 mile from the helipad.Final word of advice\u2026You MUST eat at least one night at the Kamuela Provision Company. You must make a reservation a few days in advance and make a reservation for the outside patio. It offers an unobstructed view of the sunset over the ocean that is breath taking. Its a very very popular restaurant and the outside patio fills first and it fills very quickly. The food quality was amazing, and this is coming from a jaded NYer. ", " This was our first visit to the Big Island and I was worried that our kids would experience the typical boredom factor of being in a hotel, but this place was just great. The dolphin experience was wonderful, the pool is HUGE, yet a little cold for some reason, and you literally do not have to leave the property for anything short of perhaps munchies. It's big....it takes a bit of time to walk to some places on the property, but it is a pleasant stroll and we really had no complaints. Trams can get you there faster but you are in Hawaii, why take a subway train when you can walk in paradise? Fantastic experience and will hopefully be back. ", " Excellent range of restaurants, bar staff very jovial and helpful. Room very clean with all facilities. Plenty for children and adults to do. Several pools to choose from and a huge lagoon where we saw green turtles. Good place to relax after spending a hectic week in waikiki. ", " As most reviewers have said, its a huge complex, very well kept and maintained. Rooms are large and immaculate. Kid's paradise with dolphins and a variety of pools, waterfalls and activities. Breakfast and restaurants do seem a bit on the expensive side although we found the Mololo Lounge to be good value for a light dinner and bottle of wine (limited wine selection). All staff I interacted with were very friendly, helpful, professional. I can't just sit around even a hotel this beautiful so I was glad I rented a car to explore the island during the day. Definitely a pleasure to come back in the evening and relax. Several spots for great sunsets and the runner who lights the sidewalk torches at dusk is a nice touch that we looked forward to. ", " Stayed 4 nights in the Palace Tower. No ocean view. Room was beautiful and spacious. Lots to do or not do. Huge property, lots of walking. Purchased fun pass from front desk for 27.00 a day. Saved a little money. Loved the art. Unforgettable stay. Would love to return. Luau was typical. Food okay. Mai tai had too much alcohol in it for me, it was free so can't complain. ", " We are just humble little travelers from Melbourne Australia, so when we walked into our ocean front king room on the 3rd floor in the Lagoon tower my draw dropped and I just immediately felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders....that view will stay with me forever, just glorious. I immediately took out my phone took a photo and sent it to the kids back home with the caption NA NA NA NA NA NA.We arrived mid August and the resort was busy (we later found that it was the end of summer holidays and a long weekend holiday) but once that was over it almost became deserted. Well it felt like that due to size of the place, everyone still there had heaps of room to get lost in. We booked all of our sightseeing tours through one of the Discover Hawaii desks in the resort and found them most helpful in organizing everything for us.We occasionally took the canal boat or monorail but generally liked to walk around this most beautiful piece of paradise.Our room was fantastic and cleaned really well everyday, the staff were most helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.We had a buffet breakfast every day, however we did book this when we booked our trip to Hawaii so it was really inexpensive to do it this way and it turned out to be a really good idea.We did a lot of sightseeing trips so a lot of our meals were elsewhere. When we did eat at the resort restaurants we found the prices to be comparable to what we pay in Australia (once you added the tip). A real bonus.... we arrived on the Friday and one of the dolphins had a baby on the Saturday so it was lovely to go and watch mother and baby swimming around, playing etc. ", " The Waikoloa Village is almost a \"city\" unto itself. Its beach views, its restaurants, its many pools, and the wonderful beds are all A+. It is expensive, but it is worth every penny. My husband and I would recommend it highly. After touring the volcanoes, visiting Hilo, and marveling at the contrast between the \"fields\" of black lava on the west coast of Hawai'i and the lush, almost tropical forests of the east coast, the Waikoloa Village offers a marvelous combination of both. ", " This is our second trip to the HWV and again we are totally impressed with the place. We booked the Lagoon Tower Deluxe Ocean View with Lanai. We got room 5305 this time around and we had more a view of the lagoon and the inner bay of the Pacific. The room was clean and comfortable as was last time we were here. We decided to get the Ohana Pass which gives you good discounts. For $32 a day you get internet access which is generally $12.95 per day, $6 a day valet which is normally $21 per day, or you can have 2 alcoholic beverages. We chose valet parking. You get unlimited free soda for 4, 4 ice creams, free putting course, and other discounts. This paid off immensely. We also ate breakfast daily at Waters Edge and you can by a discount card for $29.95 for a week which gives you $10 dollar voucher off a meal and also 10% at all the onsite restaurants. Again this paid off nearly in the first day.The resort was quiet for our time there between the 28th of September to the 11th of October. We chose this period as we thought it would be quiet.One drawback for us at least is they hold the Ironman Event there during the first week of our stay and this is an annual event. Kona is very busy during this time.We ate at every restaurant but the star performers were Kirin Chinese and the KPC restaurants. The food at both were great.Our family loves this place and next year we will be there for 21 days.Aloha and Mahalo Nui Loa to the Hilton Waikoloa for a brilliant time.Highly recommended! ", " We spent 5 days in a Palace Suite at this beautiful hotel. Yes, it's a huge property, but that's what we really loved about it. There were lots of places to go, both with crowds, and without. We enjoyed fantastic peace and quiet in a little cabana overlooking the ocean. We found the food generally acceptable with prices as to be expected. We appreciated the Honors $10 per person coupons vs. a specific breakfast. We found this to be more useful, as we sometimes used them for lunch or dinner. Speaking of lunch, the dim sum lunch at Kirin was outstanding. We would not hesitate to stay here in the future. And while it might be a challenge for those with mobility issues, we witnessed lots of examples of the staff helping those in need on the tram. Only negative: we found the self-parking prices excessive... ", " We colonized one enchanting room at the Hilton Waikoloa an incredible four nights and cherished every minute. A main objective of our stay was to locate and embrace as much boredom as possible, forgetting about the excruciatingly busy real lives we left behind. The hotel and grounds are beautiful throughout. Our ocean view room on the 3rd floor of the Lagoon Tower provided an extraordinary view of the pool, dolphins, ocean and glimpses of Maui peeking through the clouds every day. Arriving in mid-September, during the off-season, we felt almost lonely sharing the pool with a handful of other guests. There is a definite problem with a lack of shade at the lagoon pool and the Hilton should seriously consider investing in a few more umbrellas like the ones at the lagoon beach. During our stay, we found lovely spots under the palm trees and then followed the shade from chair to chair throughout the day, most likely inhabiting almost every possible seat between the concrete pond and the ocean during our stay. Had it been crowded, we might have become a little frustrated, not to mention painfully red. Like most of the nice resorts in Hawaii, the food was very good, but outrageously priced. We opened our wallet for the $30 breakfast buffet the first day, and thereafter enjoyed the more reasonable pastry shop in the Lagoon Tower. A collapsible cooler and a stop at the ABC store will save a bundle on soft drinks and beer at the pool, although we could also not resist a couple of tropical drinks from the pool bar each day. We enjoyed wading in the tide pools (water shoes a must) and the sights and sounds of the surf from the lounge chairs at the concrete pond. The turtles in the lagoon were fun to watch while snorkeling. If you are not careful, you will find yourself eyeball to eyeball with them in the bubbly/murky water around the waterfall. I am still trying to convince the Mrs. that she did not experience a brief emotional and physical connection with that turtle. Yes, perhaps her beautiful eyes intrigued the turtle. However, more likely, their paths unexpectedly crossed and the startled sea turtle simply did not possess the rapid reflexes to quickly maneuver away \u2026 certainly not in reverse. You can either pay $15 per day for self parking and hike to your car or $21 for valet parking and wait on the cozy benches for about 1-2 minutes while your car is delivered to you. Our legs told us the valet parking was a bargain and a small sacrifice to avoid future discomfort. We were disappointed that the shuttle boats were not running during our stay, due to canal maintenance. However, the \u201cbullet train\u201d was more than adequate, traveling at a lightening 3 mph. The walk to the lobby from lagoon tower was only about 5 minutes, if you are feeling energetic. We performed this incredible feat one time, after which our legs again demanded that we relax and enjoy the adventures of comfy cushions in the air conditioned bullet train. The other towers would require a considerably longer walk, and not very reasonable for those of us who have earned a few extra years. On the other hand, you are in Hawaii \u2026 hang loose, relax and enjoy the spectacular scenery that unfolds around every corner of this resort. The bullet train will get you to your fantasyland location soon enough. You can rush to your destination when you get back home to your real life. We actually rode the bullet train round trip once just for kicks (OK, by accident) to see the \u201cother side of the world\u201d. We ended up spotting a Red Billed Gangly Crowned Crane just a few feet outside the bullet train. Wait \u2026 don\u2019t search for that in the Avian dictionary, because I just made it up. However, the point is that the strange bird was very phenomenal and we would not have seen it had we not accidentally grabbed the bullet train in the wrong direction and ended up in the holy grail of marooned Hilton shuttle boats. Also missed would have been personally witnessing the infamous event responsible for the stranding of the shuttle boats \u2026 the removal of green, slimy, rotten goo in one section of the canal by several unfortunate souls, whom we did not envy. Several restaurants are a short drive away, providing plenty of evening dining choices. Our favorites were Tommy Bahamas, about a 10 minute drive north, and Buzz\u2019s Sandtrap, 2 blocks away from the lobby. If travelling between the west and east side of the island, don\u2019t miss Hawaiian Style Caf\u00e9 for breakfast in Waimea (30 minutes from the Hilton). Don\u2019t be fooled by the appearance! The valet parking attendant at the Hilton suggested the restaurant to us as we were leaving on the last day and we would have never stopped otherwise. Suggestion: order 1 breakfast for 2 people \u2026 2 monster pancakes swallowing the plate underneath, another plate full of scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns \u2026 $8.75 ... best food deal on the island. Not knowing, we ordered 2 breakfasts, ate until our stomachs bulged and still left most of the food uneaten. We should have taken the hint when we saw the \u201cFat boy\u201d t-shirts displayed on the wall for sale \u2026 I am a slow learner. Thanks Hilton for the wonderful memories! ", " I stay here in September for business and vacation almost every year.This Hilton property is one of the best I've visited. There are a lot of excellent facilities for you to relax - outdoor swimming pools, fitness center, and spa. It is worth noting that, however, you can access the fitness center free-of-charge only if you are a Hilton Silver/Gold member. The big buffet breakfast is awesome though it may be overpriced! There are also quite a number of good restaurants and bars inside this hotel together with a shopping mall with walking distance. The hotel room is large and comfortable. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for our Honeymoon in September of 2011 and we were very impressed with our experience there. This is the most beautiful resort I have stayed in; the ambience and mood of the place is perfect, and the grounds are expansive so it\u2019s always possible to find a place of solitude and privacy. You do have to do a bit of walking to and from your room, especially depending on which tower you stay in. We stayed in Palace Tower and I found the walk to the lobby to be about 10 minutes and not that much slower than taking the tram. I\u2019m actually quite annoyed by the number of reviews here complaining about the amount of walking, because the truth is the grounds are so interesting and beautiful you will want to walk them. There is an large collection of art on display in the hallways which also have one side open to the outdoors. Outside, the maze of stone walkways takes you through bridges, waterfalls, meandering pools and rivers, lagoons and many magnificent views of the ocean; it is breathtaking.  The food is expensive, but worth every penny. I recommend splurging one night at KPC \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best meals we\u2019ve ever had. We also got amazing food and great service at the Japanese restaurant, Imari. Every morning we stopped at the Kimobean coffee shop at the Ocean Tour. They have the smoothest Kona coffee and you can get a coffee and frittata or pastry for less than $10. We found this was a good way to save on our food budget, as the sit-down breakfast option at the resort, \u201cBig Island Breakfast,\u201d is about $30. You can also walk 15 minutes to the Kings and Queens shops right outside the hotel which feature a few more affordable restaurant options. I would recommend renting a car because despite the beauty and wealth of options at the hotel, there is so much to see on the island that you won\u2019t want to miss. You\u2019ll obviously spend more to have the car, but you can take it about a 30 minute drive south to Kona where the affordable dining options multiply and there is a bit more of a night life. The resort is also about a 15 minute drive from some of the best beaches on the island. Lastly, we were very impressed with the service. Everyone we met was so genuinely polite and friendly. And the grounds, including our room, were always in ship shape.I highly recommend this hotel for a honeymoon or island escape. If you're looking for ambience, great service and great food, this hotel will exceed your expectations. ", " We stayed at the Hilton for 7 days on vacation. The one thing that sticks out is the customer service. Everyone was helpful & kind: from the bellman, to the vallet, to housekeeping, to the concierge.The property is gorgeous! If you go to Hawaii, you want to feel like you're in paradise, & this resort accomplishes that. Tip: request either the lagoon tower or the palace tower. The ocean tower is very far away & people complained of 15 min walks to the lobby and 10 min tram rides. People also complained of noisy birds & lack of restaurants & pool activity. We stayed in the palace tower, which was great. Lagoon tower is the closest to everything.As far as the food: Go out to the nearby towns & get local cuisine. The hotel food is average & WAY overpriced. There is plenty to do & see on Ali'i Dr in Kailua-Kona. We ate on Ali'i Dr once per day. Hawaiian Style Cafe is also popular in Waimea. We enjoyed it. We NEVER ate breakfast at the hotel. Also, we never shopped at the Queens Market; etc. Waste of money. Well worth the 20 min drive to town.There are beaches nearby: one is 10-15 mins down the rd towards Waimea. One is 5 miles down the road towards Kona. It's a gorgeous hidden gem across from the memorial cemetary exit (there are no marked signs). There is also a small beach in Kailua-Kona that is pretty cool. We recommend that you take a volcano helicopter tour. We used Safari helicopters (drove to Hilo). There are plenty of things to sightsee on your way to Hilo. Ask the concierge to point them out. ", " We've stayed here twice. It is a large property and has something for everyone. The pools are nice but pretty busy. If you prefer more solitude, a lounge chair on the point is nice. We prefer the Palace Tower. It is centrally located and much more quiet than the other towers. It is a great property to walk but the tram and boats are available also. The dolphin pool is always entertaining. For a fabulous dining experience, book a patio table for sunset dining at the Kamuela Provision Company. Enjoy a drink called the \"Green Flash\" while looking for the elusive, real green flash (which I saw twice this trip). ", " I have stayed at this resort twice in the past 6 months. It is really beautiful and the rooms are large and spacious but what really makes it a wonderful place are the staff. Don't get me wrong they are not perfect and little things may get overlooked like the safe not being unlocked, a lack of glasses in the room or the food service being a little slow but they happily make them right. I love the Big Island, especially the welcoming people there.Please know that this is a large resort although it never seemed crowded. Please bring comfortable walking shoes as there can be a lot of walking. We did more walking this past week as the canal was under maintenance so the boats were not running and the wait for the tram seemed a bit long. ", " This is beautiful hotel for lovers or families! The pool is great, it even has a slide that the kids love! Go with this hotel, you won't be disappointed! ", " Just returned from a one week stay at The Hilton Waikoloa... this place is fantastic... anyone who complains about the prices for food and drink here are 3 star seekers and should be going to some cheap all inclusive or something... you want expensive drinks try The W Hotel on South Beach $25.00 mojitos .... that's expensive but $8.00 for a drink at this lush unbelievably luxurious resort is NOT expensive. The rooms are simple ... that is true but totally comfortable and clean ... the tub drains properly the room was made everyday on time without any inconvenience... the toilets actually flush... the a/c works fine... the sheets were soft and the mattress was excellent... lots of feather pillows as many as we wanted... the mattress on the sofa bed was a little hard... Also, there is a F&B card you can purchase that entitles you to 10% off all of your food & beverage purchases. This place is great... super fun for kids, tons of activities and places to shop... Macy's, Tiffany, Coach all down the street ... fabulous upscale market also down the street with an excellent selection of food and wine, beer, spirits, etc. There is a fridge in your room if your significant other isn't a big spender and doesn't want to treat you to any of the fantastic restaurants on the resort.... I was 100% pleased with our stay at The Hilton Waikoloa - tennis was amazing... luau was super fun... I can go on and on .... ", " David, our waiter at Big Island Breakfast gave us excellent service plus, pointed out some special events located on our planned route that would make our day exploring the island a unique experience. The island is fantastic - the volcano, stargazing on Mauna Kea, beaches, etc. You could spend a great week exploring the hotel, but we were happy we were able to split our time between hotel activities and exploring the island. ", " If you're looking for a place on the Big Island...this is it. Great spot/location. Nice pool. Great Golf, awesome room...needed it. Only downside is it's a little touristy---and 30 minutes from anything. ", " Stayed three times at the HGVC Waikoloa Beach Resort in a 2 Bedroom Premier. Very nice, high quality furnishings in units. The body showers in the master bath were great! The location is good since there are several restaurants/stores nearby and the Hilton offers free shuttle service around the immediate area and to the Hilton Waikoloa Hotel. Outstanding service from friendly staff. Would definitely return to stay again. ", " The ideal resort for couples who appreciate history and art, as the entire hotel walkways are filled with interesting pieces. The landscaping is beautiful and the pools/lagoon offers different activities for families as well. They also have a Dolphin Quest program that allows guests to swim with the dolphins..of course with a fee. There are many eating places near by, both fast foods and fine dining that give families a choice. My favorite was Roy's at Waikoloa in the King Shopping center. ", " We stayed here for just one night in August and absolutely loved it. Everything you could want or need is right there. Even if you don't stay there you need to go visit the grounds,it is open to the public with the exception of the pools. Our view was spectacular as was the service and food. The rooms were spotless and had everything we needed. We always stay in a condo so we can prepare our own meals but for the person that does not intend to cook, it is a great place to stay. The dolphins at Dolphin quest are so enchanting, I could sit and watch them for hours. The food is a bit expensive but it's a short drive to more food opportunities. ", " We stayed here recently for 7 nights in 2 inter-connecting rooms on the recommendation of friends and were not disappointed. It was a very easy 25 minute drive to get here. We stayed in the lagoon tower in what seemed like very large rooms with walk in robes and separate bathrooms with the vanity just outside the toilet/shower. The rooms were beautifully appointed and we had views of the ocean and the dolphin pool down below. The rooms were quiet. This location was brilliant as we had excellent and easy access to the main pool with the slide and those thunderous waterfalls. Highly recommended to families as the Ocean Wing seemed far away. We also had easy access to the monorail which ran from morning to night and also to the boat which went for only part of the day. This was not of an issue for us as we were on \"island time\" and happy to just walk everywhere and explore this amazing resort. The gardens and the waterfalls around this island resort were simply spectacular and are very well maintained. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and had everything you could possibly want. Only thing, staff were a bit slow clearing tables away and therefore attracting the odd hungry bird. The Japanese restaurant had lovely food although service here was also a bit slow and we had to ask for menus a couple of times and someone to take our order a couple of times. Orchid marketplace at lunchtime or for just for a snack was perfect. Offering everything from sushi to burgers to salads to ice-creams, the variety was fantastic. Staff were also great and helpful here. We dined only once at the lagoon grill and ordered the lobster burgers. Overpriced and overated! You could have been eating a fishcake on a sweet roll for what it was worth. The lagoon spoon for breakfast would be a 1 off treat for the kids. It is not expensive at all, however once the kids spot the gummy bear and other junkfood dispensers they can have on top of their cereal, lookout. Staff here were very friendly. The KPC restaurant for dinner was brilliant. We had a lovely outdoor table and had a fantastic waiter. The food was different as we ordered the specials of the night and we were pleasantly surprised. Even the kids ate well. The kids got to do the dolphin experience which although very expensive, was a once in a lifetime treat. The ocean fed lagoon was where we started with our day so that the kids could enjoy the array of watersports. Here they rode waterbikes, paddleboats, snorkelled, swam with a variety of fish and up to 3 large turtles each day and made many new friends. Only thing is, having to enjoy the watersports meant we had to spend a lot of money for the pleasure. This exercise was not a cheap one. Despite that, we truly enjoyed this holiday because we could do as much or as little as we wanted and knew that even the kids were safe here.We hope to go back one day. ", " We started this vacation hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I must say from the moment we walked in, we received nothing but the best service!There were two trams running (monitors show you how long of a wait you have at each station). We walked when we wanted and waited when the kids were to tired. Boats were not in service (bummer). As mentioned by many others, the resort is huge. Do some planning before you get to the check in counter. If you want to be in the Lagoon Tower close to shopping, large pool and biggest water slide let them know. We wanted Ocean tower, great sunsets, several pools and a few water slides quieter on this side. Many restaurants to choose from at the resort. Pricing is what you expect 14.00 cheeseburger (good), seven dollar beers. You get what I am saying. Its time consuming if you go out for all meals, you'll never enjoy the resort. Everything takes time, from leaving your room to getting to the car (you need a car) to finding a restaurant. You have to drive to Kona for larger variety of restaurants. We did a little of both.Our room was just fine for four. Large walk in closet with safe. Mini fridge and small coffee pot. Kids loved the lagoon, snorkeling, swimming, water sports. We never had trouble finding shade or chairs. Same thing for pools, always a place to lay out. They do require you to wear a wristband (colors change daily) to use the waterslides. No problem kids actually enjoyed collecting the colors and having a wrist full of bands. Dolphin quest was wonderful expensive but how can you tell the kids no on swimming with a dolphin. Both kids did it and really enjoyed it. Extras are expensive digitial pics 150.00 for all and 65.00 for video. We bought both of course. We couldn't get close enough with our equipment to get the same type of shots that they did.Kids visited the kids club once (not free). They do offer dive-in movie night. They offer a free story telling night. Two men playing Hawaii music and ladies telling history of the island. We even got to make a lei for free!!!!Luau was nice expensive but nice. They have a kids buffet which was nice since my son didn't want fish and pork. They also sell lei's there for photos....All and all we will be going back. The island is very low key, no night life which is fine but very friendly and lots of beautiful places visit. Lastly parking expensive 15.00 self-parking, 21.00 valet. Your choice! ", " This was one of our most memorable vacations, ever, here on the Hilton Waikoloa Village. We travelled with another family of 4. We had adjoining rooms. The hotel is perfectly located by the King & Queen shops, Grocery store, and restaurants. We had BBQ mix plates about 3 times that week. We took back the best Poke from the grocery store to our rooms many times that week, too. We were almost an hour way from Hilo, which was awesome drive...same with the Volcanos. Those are a must. Check out the local swap meets, too. Visit the Black Sands beach on the way to the Volcanos. (Bring tennis shoes if you're going to hike at the volcanos. All in all, if you just stay at the hotel, I recommend paying for the \"all-day\" rentals. We used their paddle boats, snorkle gear, stand-up boards, etc. for about $100+. That's a deal compared to $25 for an hour. If you haven't been to a luau, they have a nice one. They have a beautiful spa. Also, you can take a tram, or boat to take you from one end of the resort, to the other. My 10 year-old son, along with our friend's 9 year old daughter, participated in the Dolphin excursion. They loved it. Oh! And they have a nice couple of sisters that sing beautifully with their guitar playing almost every night at the lounge. The kids can still play in the next room, while you sit and enjoy a cocktail. We would definitely head back in a second! ", " I've been enjoying the Hilton Waikoloa since the early 1990s and will continue to come here every few years. They take great care of the grounds and are very friendly. This place is VERY large so be ready to plan ahead if you plan on renting a car and need to get from your room to the front of the hotel. One additional thing to consider is that there is not a beach at this hotel. It is mostly rocks along the coast. Not a big deal for most people because the pools are awesome but for those looking for a beach right at your hotel, you may want to look elsewhere down the road. ", " This was our 4th visit to this resort . We stayed for 12 days. Heard that the resort was quite full but somehow it never feels that way. We simply love this place: beautiful property, great staff, serenity. Marvellous views of the Pacific and beautiful sunsets. Keep it up Hilton Waikoloa and we shall return again....soon! Mahalo. P.S. for dinner, visit Merriman's Cafe which is close by - great food. ", " Great weather in Waikoloa with 357 days of sun per year. The pools were the best I have seen, larger and more dramatic then the best in vegas. The lagoon is not to be missed and is great for kids. Overall, great amenities and service, with spectacular location. Views of maui were nice. ", " We came to Big Island as the 2nd stop on our honeymoon (1st stop Vegas). Being a Geography teacher I was very excited to visit the island. A first impression of the Hilton was the fact that the hotel is MASSIVE!!! Just checking in and the tram comes into the lobby to pick people up?? Crazy big! We were based in the Ocean Tower which was the furthest away from a lot of the amenities but this is compensated by the fact that the views consisted of the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea and (on a clear day) Mauna Loa.Like a lot of reviews previous I will break down the pros and cons as I found these useful before I went on our trip:Pros \u2022 There is a lot to do and we never got bored including the vast lagoon with watersports complete with matching turtle!\u2022 The area of the hotel is really well cared for and walking through even the corridors is like walking through a Polynesian museum. \u2022 The staff were very accommodating and upgraded us to a suite- which was lovely and like I said a gorgeous view.\u2022 Swimming pools are amazing but the best one was by the Lagoon tower so quite a trek for us.\u2022 There was quite a range of restaurants- we ate at Bella Vista and KPC- both very nice.Cons\u2022 Breakfast was busy in fact the rest of the day there was hardly anyone around but this meant the minimum wait for breakfast was 10 minutes.\u2022 The Ocean Tower is lovely but so far away from the rest of the place however we hardly used the tram as 1) these are quite slow and 2) Walking off dinner/lunch is only a good thing and the gardens are gorgeous.\u2022 The bird issue: Quite noisy at dawn and dusk but to be honest didn\u2019t really notice them.\u2022 The car park was $15 to park each day so being there for 9 nights means a nice bill at the end of the stay.Overall we were really upset to leave Big Island as the landscape is incredible and the people are so friendly. The Hilton made our stay complete and poor San Francisco (3rd stop) never stood a chance as all we wanted to do is to back to Hawaii. ", " Always try to spend at least a week in this hotel which is spread out over many acres of waterfront property. Try and stay in the Lagoon accommodation area (a bit more expensive but well worth it) for its convenience to swimming areas and parking, and a shorter walk to King and Queen's shopping centres. Have stayed here approx 10 times over many years and have always enjoyed the experience. ", " Our family with two teenage stayed there for 6 nights in August, 2011 . We loved the resort so much.We booked the resort view for the room. At the check-in, I asked the Lagoon Tower as it's the closest tower to the parking lot.We got it and our room was with partial ocean view which was so beautiful. The room was nice, roomy and the bed was very comfortable. The double bed is little small for two people. But, it was not big deal and we had nice sleep through the entire stay.The breakfast was very good and the services at restaurant was great.The resort was gorgeous. The views are fantastic from everywhere. I loved to walk along the coast every morning. With the tropical plants and the arts arrangements in the resort along the ocean, the view is just breathtaking.My other favorite thing to do is to watch the sunset at the coast of the resort. The sunset was so beautiful and romantic.Our family loved the beach and the pools, We did snorkeling and saw the turtles and tropical fishes in the beach. We also played the stand up paddle boarding, kayak and paddle boat. It was fun.My daughter also did Dolphin Encounter program in the resort and she loved it.We also rented a car and visited the Hawai\u2018i Volcanoes National Park, Akaka Falls State Park, Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden, Umauma Falls, Mauna Kea, Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park, Other beaches on the Kona coast, as well as had helicopter ride to watch the volcano which was an amazing experience. Everything was so good during our stay, The only thing I suggest is that they should put more people at the front desk during the busy hours as it seems to run a little slow.We had a great time at big island. I will definitely stay in this resort again. It's a very beautiful and nice resort overall. ", " We stayed there for a business conference. I expected better food; I'd give it a C+. The grounds are breath-taking! There are three hotels on the grounds but getting around is easy with the tram that runs between them. The staff was A+, and the view as we exited our building was the Pacific Ocean!!! WOW. The meals are pricey, $25 for the breakfast buffet but we were told to expect this. The room was clean and well appointed. Would we stay there again? Yes if my company was paying the way. ", " This hotel is absolutely one of my favorite properties on Earth. It is beautiful...clean and perfect for a \"get away from it all\" vacation.OK. Things here are expensive - food, water craft rentals, etc. But everything in Hawaii is expensive, so entering into the vacation that has to be expected.My room had a partial ocean view and my Diamond status with Hilton earned me $20 a day in comp food which I used for coffee and a pastry in the morning.The restaurants are good but expensive.The size of the hotel at first is overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal at all. Travelling on the other side of the tram is much quicker than walking down the parallel hallway.I will 100% return. ", " Beautiful expansive hotel with wondeful views. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff was professional but not overly outgoing. No beach, but the pool was incredible. Lagoon was a lot of fun. Buy the all day pass at the lagoon and enjoy all the different watercraft. Restaurants on the property are expensive, even for resort food, but the quality and portions were good. Chinese restaurant was excellent. Drive a short distance down the road to the market and buy food there. Great selection, good prices. Best part was the price. This is easily a 4-star property but the price was too good to pass up. ", " My family and I love this hotel! it was our second time visiting the island and we had just as much as an amzing time as last time. This hotel is great for people of all ages. it is so big and has about everything in it. it feels like a paradise within a paradise. After awhile it started to almost feel like home. We stayed in the lagoon tower and every night we went to eat at our favorite resturaut in the resort, the lagoon grill. we loved the giant lagoon right next to us that by the way has great snorkeling. there is alson the dolphin lagoon where we all swam with the dolphins. There is so much i can say about this hotel and i definatly recommend this hotel to everyone. it is an incredible experiance and i would go back in a heartbeat. ", " The service was American of course, but pretty good. And it is like a high class village. Food was a little expensive, but very good quality. This was really a unique experience and now we have to bring the kids back at least once. This was truely a Good Living experience for the budget travelers. They thought of everything. ", " This resort is phenomenal. It's as if Disney and Hilton had a brainchild and stuck it on the Big Island. It's a vast resort with 3 towers accessible by tram, boat, or a beautiful but not short walk. None of the photos online truly convey how big or how amazing this place is. My husband and I chose this resort for our destination wedding/honeymoon and wouldn't have changed a thing. The wedding coordinator was fantastic and the location superb. We will definitely plan future trips to this resort. If you have a big group, the suites in the Palace Tower are unbelievably fantastic! ", " This is the second year that we come back to the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a day pass the offer for a fee which allows you to utilize the resort facilities that are many.We are lucky to have friends that own a home in Kona, so we do not stay at the hotel all the time, but the days we spend at the Hilton are a lot of fun.The employees have all been nice to us, but this last time we need to recognize Tom French specially as he helped us with a problem we had. We will be back and will recommend the place to all our friends and family. Thank you!!!! ", " The front desk gave us an upgrade and we stayed in a high room in front of the dolphins, it was the best! The room was gorgeous and very clean. And all the resort is a dream. We snorkel with turtles in the big lagoon, we had a romantic dinner with a beautifull sunset, we took a train that runs all of the property, very nice! Ok, it's very pricey but it's Hawaii and it's the best!!! ", " The hotel was great, the Big Island was amazing, but the helpfulness of Jim Russell, Director of Front Office Operations, was truly one of the best parts of our vacation. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we had learned of a problem with our reservation made through an Expedia package (most likely due to an inputting error on my part). Mr. Russell really went out of his way to help, resolving the matter with Expedia. Oh yeah, and the hotel was pretty amazing as well. From the monorail to pool system that stretches the length of the property, my family and I loved this hotel. We would definitely stay here again. ", " I loove the big island! Definitely a huge difference from where I live in small town Northern Illinois. LOL! The climate is amazing, smells wonderful...the only thing I didn't like was that there were cats everywhere. My mom and I went to the spa. Great experience! Also saw John Travolta while we were there. Everything is a big pricey...but hey it's Hawaii, what do you expect? Worth every penny! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is 62 acres of awesomeness. If the boats and trams that transport guests to and from 1,500 rooms and suites, nine restaurants and two dozen retailers don\u2019t suggest that this isn\u2019t your usual Hawaiian resort, it\u2019s got to be an array of aquatic attractions that include cascading waterfalls, sleepy lagoons and pools (four for humans, one for dolphins). Getting wet at the Hilton Waikoloa can be tranquil (the adults-only pool is a welcome retreat from the crowds, noise and excited kids), thrilling (the 175-foot twisting waterslide is a rush) or amusing (the Hilton\u2019s own saltwater lagoon with white-sand beach is an exquisite locale for swimming, snorkeling and renting a variety of family-friendly watercraft from the Ocean Sports shack.) Frills at the Hilton Waikoloa can practically fill Halema'uma'u crater. ", " This is a large property and has a train that runs through the hotel. The beach is very narrow with barely enough room to stretch out. It's also pretty crowded, as are the pools. However, I don't have any complaints about my stay. If you have young kids, this hotel seemed to have a lot of activities, such as swiming with the dolphins, that they can enjoy. The breakfast buffet has made to order omlettes or you can order from a menu. The hotel is not far a local shopping area, so that's convenient. ", " There were eight of us from age two through 62 and we had a wonderful time. There was enought for the little one to do with the boat rides, dolphin shows and kid friendly pools. The adults had fun too, plenty of opportunites for romantic dinners and watching the sunset over the beautiful Pacific Ocean. And this was all without leaving the Hilton! The staff was great, very accomodating and professional. Would definitely give it a thumbs up! ", " This beautiful resort was just what were looking for when we booked our Kona trip. It is a beautiful place that gives you much of the splendor of Hawaii without traveling all over the island. The weather was sunny and warm here, while it was cloudy and cool in Kona. Lots of pools, so you could avoid children if that's what you want. Our room included breakfast each morning and we enjoyed the leisure of taking our time getting up and heading down to breakfast. We found the tram ran frequently and rarely had to wait long. Close to nice shopping and some great restaurants. Yes we will return to this little corner of paradise. ", " Loved, loved, loved this property. The grounds were beyond beautiful, the sculptures and statues throughout added to what was already a breathtaking tropical paradise. There was so much to do! We would start the day with breakfast at the Lagoon Spoon (where the children got to eat cereals I would never let them have at home) while watching dolphins swim so close we could practically touch them. We spent the afternoon playing in the pools, the waterslides, and in the lagoon. The sea turtles in the lagoon are very tame and would swim right under our paddleboards! Then in the evening there are several excellent (and some inexpensive) restaurants on sight or several more just a mile down the road. The trams and boats made getting from one place to another fun, or you could make the short walk yourself. Even the weather was perfect! The only downside to this hotel is that is so amazing you might never want to leave it to get out to see the rest of the island. ", " Thanks to Costco travel and finally being able to get my entire family together...we spent 10 glorious days enjoying all there is to offer at this hotel. One really never needs to leave. 68 acres full of pools, lagoons, water slides, restaurants, dolphins, giant sea turtles, tide pools, beautiful scenery, and people who care about you as a guest. The best rooms, of course, look out on the blue Pacific, and there are a FEW rooms which have some disadvantages due to noise and constant traffic... but over-all, it's paradise. Rooms come with mini-fridges.. so you can eat yourself into oblivion at the sumptuous morning buffet, and then stock the fridge with snacks to tide you over during the day so that you can eat again at night! What's not to like? The tram (or the boat) take you from one side of the resort to the other.... and if you miss one or the other... you can walk off all you've eaten! That works :) !!!Meals can be a bit on the pricey side. But, if you plan ahead, and research other options.. you can get by just fine. Our trip included breakfast, which, as I said before, is NOT to be missed!Relaxation is the name of the game here.... we NEVER watched tv... only used our laptops to upload pictures... and got away from it ALL! Isn't that the REASON you go on vacation? ", " From the moment we arrived, the Front Desk and Special Events staff was attentive and helpful. It was as if they were anticipating our needs. An excellent business destination for learning, engagement and recognition. ", " my husband and i stayed for 4 nights and had a perfect time. the staff was helpful. the place was beautiful (and i don't usually like properties this large). and having the dolphins to visit every morning was like a spiritual experience. close to beautiful beaches. great water sports and restaraunts. ", " As in our past visits here we were treated as very special guests. I'm a Diamond VIP and they really treated us special. We asked for a late checkout and even though the hotel was totally sold out the management found a way to give us a late checkout time. My wife and I were walking through the property and I looked at her and said \"This place just makes me happy\". The management and staff here are wonderful. My fantasy is to live here in a suite the rest of my life. I have traveled to many places in the world, but this place is truly enchanting. ", " A beautiful resort with great customer service. We stayed in the Ocean Tower on our honeymoon and even received a complimentary bottle of champagne. The walk to the Ocean Tower is not bad at all. It takes longer to wait for the tram than it would to just walk. The Kona Pool near the Lagoon Tower is the better pool out of the 3. The Ocean Tower featured an Adults only pool, but it was only open until 5PM. We were disappointed that an Adults only place wasn't open any later. ", " 5th Trip since 1998 - highlighting new learnings this tripHOTEL:Awesome as usual. NOTE: This hotel targets families with children but for those looking to esape the so called \"Disney\" atmosphere there are other options nearby such as the Marriott, Mauna Lani, Hapuna Beach Hotel, and hotel options in Kona. This is not a party hotel - sidewalks roll up at 9:00 pm although pools open until 11:00 - know this in advance if you are looking for night life close by hotel.Transportation systems work well for patient people, trams run 6am-11pm, boats run 2pm-11pm, otherwise stay in Lagoon Tower for less walking. Propery is immaculate. Use lower lobby for luggage drop off and pick up - just past main entrance on left. May want to match room location to desired pools if walking is an issue. Ocean Tower pools or sandy Lagoon pool best for small children under 42\" as well as childless couples looking to relax. Kona pool near Lagoon Tower best for kids over 42\" tall and active adults - only hot tubs are loacted around the Kona pools - none at Ocen Tower pools. Tall pool slide hours are 9:00am - 6:00pm except small child slide at Ocean tower pool is open 8:00am-11:00pm. Ocean tower by definition has the best views - three sections have 8,7, and 6 floors. Best views are from 6th floor of west wing of Ocean Tower. Suites also available mostly in Palace and Ocean Towers. Parking is $15+ per day and is plentiful, internet is not free in rooms unless included in rate or using Aloha Passport - know these facts in advance but not an issue for most. Check out Aloha Passport program for activity discounts, $25 per day -or- Lagoon equipment rental discount for $4.50 per day - entire stay only. Lagoon chairs, especially covered ones go fast. Uncovered pool chairs not usually an issue. If breakfast not included in room rate, eat in room or at other options on property such as Lagoon Spoon. Feral cats on property especially in parking lot will not bother you. Weasels also seen between Lagoon and ocean strip. Hotel concierge very helpful for questions regarding excursions, shopping, driving, etc. Wedding chapel and general photographer hire. Ocean Tower has mini-desk for room key issues, etc and adult-only pool with no view.RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS:Hawaiian Style in Waimea for breakfast/early lunchMerrimans (original) in WaimeaPaniolo's in WaimeaPoncho's & Lefty's in KonaRosa's Cantina in KonaHuggo's in KonaKen's HOP in HiloSeveral Options on Waikoloa Beach Drive including those at King & Queen ShopsQueen Shops Food Court popular with manyOn-site formal dining could disappoint (Kirin, Imari, KPC, new Italian)Ocen tower breakfast pavillion and Donatoni replacement reopened the week of July 4, 2011 due to pickup in economy.SHOPPING OPTIONS INCLUDING GROCERIES:Target, Wal-Mart, and K-MartSafewayKing & Queen ShopsKona Alii Drive shops - avoid on Wednesdays due to cruise ship foot trafficFarmer's Market on Alii Drive Wednesday - Sunday - avoid on Wednesday due to cruise ship foot trafficWaimea shoppiing plazaSmall coastal townsORGANIZED EXCURSIONS:Blue Hawaiian Helicopters - close to hotel, some may consider priceyMajor Excussion Operators - avoid on Wednesday due to cruise ships (Zip lines, Fishing, Glass Bottom Boats, Submarine, volcano tours)DRIVING TRIPS:4wd Jeep Cherokee or extended Jeep Wrangler strongly recommended - more driving options - book earlyHilo and waterfalls on NE/East side of islandVNP on SE sideHawi/Waipio Valley on North sideUS Southernmost point on South side (nice vistas and wind turbines)Mauna Loa visitor center and summit - daytime for viewing, nights for stargazing (4WD)Coffee growing/processing south of Captain Cook ", " We recently spent two weeks in Hawaii \u2013 week one at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and week two at the Grand Wailea on Maui. This was our third trip to the Big Island (BI) and also third time to Waikoloa Village. Our party consisted of myself and my wife and our kids (daughter 16, daughter 14, and son 10). The BI is our favorite island in Hawaii.Summary: The property is beautiful and the pools and spa are great as is the staff. We use the hotel as a base to explore other parts of the island as well as just relax on the off days.Room: This year we rented a Suite (3097) to give us a bit more room (and also so we would not have to smuggle the third child in as we usually do). Suite had a large bedroom with King bed and a very large bathroom with separate toilet, shower and sink areas so multiple people could use the facilities. We also had a rollaway bed that our 10 year old used. We have always stayed in the Ocean Towers at Waikoloa and these are the best for us. Though furthest from the parking lot and main pool area \u2013 it is the quietest area and has beautiful walkways along the ocean.Food: In general, we went off property for most meals so I can\u2019t speak for the quality. Since our room had a small refrigerator, we kept milk, OJ (and beer) and had cereal and bagels in the room (or on the Lanai) for breakfast. This saved us about $80/day over what breakfast would have cost us at a restaurant. On one night, we did get takeout from Kirin (on-site Chinese restaurant) and my wife and kids got very sick (they had the MooGoo Gai Pan) \u2013 I had Orange Chicken that was good. Going off-site we have to recommend the Hawaiian Style Caf\u00e9 (in Waimea \u2013 about 25 minutes away). Great food at great prices \u2013 the kids love it. Also, the Paniolo Country Inn (near Hawaiian Style Caf\u00e9 had good food at reasonable prices. On the Kona side (about 30 minutes away) we recommend Splashers for breakfast.Pools: The pools were never really crowded and we heard several people comment on this \u2013 it may have just been our week (just before the 4th of July). Always clean and the attendants kept the areas very nice. We love snorkeling in the Lagoon in the morning. We always see at least 4 sea turtles that come in to feed on the grass/plants by the waterfall \u2013 and even come up and peer directly into your mask \u2013 fortunately they are vegetarians. Parking/Trams: We did not use valet. We enjoy the walk to the lot to get the car. Sometimes in the Ocean Tower if you miss the tram \u2013 it is a 10-15 minute walk to the lobby and another 5 minutes or so to get the car. If you are always in a hurry \u2013 this may not be for you \u2013 but on vacation it is very relaxing walk through the propery.Other activities on the BI: Hula Kai AM snorkel trip (best one IMHO). Secret Lava Tube tour (call Volcano National Park for details in advance), beaches (Hapuna and Mauna Kea) are world class. Note \u2013 Mauna Kea Hotel will only let in first 40 cars to access the public beach and park in their lot. ", " We stayed at this hotel on July 4 - July 8, 2011. This was the nicest resort we've ever stayed at and we travel a lot for business and w/ family. The staff was incredible, the room cleaning service was amazing and the amenities priceless (the Dolphins are always ready to entertain; even when off-duty). Our 2 and 4 year old enjoyed the sand pool and water slides even at their young ages. There's plenty of shaded areas by the pools and lagoons. My children saw sea turtles up close, viewed colorful fish and saw their first eel as we looked in the lagoon area (you can swim in there too, but the sea life stay away from swimmers). The property is spotless with incredible views from every angle. The property is vast (15-20 min walk fron one end to the other), yet the train, boats and museum walkway provide plenty of transportation options for travelers. The art work provides an incredible learning experience that beckoned me to walk (and learn) more. If you have tight time schedules, a little planning is required on your part; but if you are here to enjoy yourself, vacation, relax and take-in the beauty of Hawaii, you must stay here! There are shops close-by (about 1/2 mile down road) if you need anything - - anything. The event management staff is the best - kudos to Haley Albertson for her amazing talents, calmness and responsiveness. We will definitely return. ", " 4 of us (9 yr old girl)As many other people have stated, the opposite opinions on this hotel amaze me. Overall, we had a great time. We stayed in the lagoon tower and paid a bit extra to guarantee our room in that hotel so we could over look the dolphins and have a ocean view(which they said we would not have, but we did). Also all the action is on that side of the resort, so it made sense for less walking. The trams and boats were fine, keep an eye in your room on the TV and you know when it is coming. The lagoon was awesome for snorkeling and playing, with turtles, fish, eels, and even a stingray. Room:The best view - ocean, sunset, sunrise, and the dolphins (my 9 year old loved it). It was big, clean, and the fridge was cold). We could hear the birds some, but you get that in tropical locales, no big deal.Dining:KPC had the best view and food. It is all expensive, but we knew that going in so plan on it. You can cut the costs, by bringing in your own stuff if you want, but we were on vacation and weren't going to do that. The only problem I had the entire time was at Kirin (chinese) They charged $3 for a bowl of steamed rice!!!!! You kidding me? I didn't have any problem with $4 shirley temples, but steamed rice? We are from Texas, that is like a Tex-Mex place charging for chips and salsa; you go out of business if you do that here. I had a hard time with that, especially since they did not tell you that. Overall the food was ok. The Big Island breakfast was good, the Japanese place, the entertainment was better back home. If you have a car go to queens market place and get some supplies (water, fruits, snacks, whatever) They even have fast food there which we did use.Staff: Seemed very nice, there were some places where they were not as friendly, but it didn't bother me. I probably would not have even noticed if not for the reviews on this site.Parking:If you don't want to walk just valet, we used our car a lot, and it was worth it.Entertainment:We did a trip around the island and several to Kona for parasailing, snorkel, etc... It was great. the 30-40 min drive is bad, worst than the desert to look at, but it is worth it, for the fun, just combine your trips, like we did a sub and parasail on the same day and ate lunch in town. By the way the Kona Brewing company is awesome for pizza and beer.. hapuna beach (North a few minutes is awesome). Black sand beach on the other side of the island is a must see. We were lucky and saw a big turtle sunning himself.Extra: they have a $25 a day package which gets you half off snorkel, equipment rentals, 2 free drinks, and 2 free miniature golf each day.Overall: it was fantastic. I would not go back, simply b/c we would not go back to the island. I did tell them they could step up in one area....A scavenger hunt like Kim Possible at Disney or MagiQuest at great wolf lodge. They have 60 acres, it would be a perfect fit. ", " Just got in from a 6 night stay at HWV. Excellent time, Briefly the pros and cons, IMORoom - stayed in Ocean Tower 2049 (ground floor). pro: you can walk out your room to the grass and trail, is on edge of resort, quiet and faces west for the sunset views, easy walk to boat (faster) and tram, east access to tiki trail. con - might have a better view from higher up.Food/Supplies - 3 grocery stores nearby. 1) KTA in Waikola Village Market (about 8 mi away) has best food and booze (beer/wine/liqu) prices. Locals shop here and you can view their weekly ad on line 2) Whalers in Kings Plaza 1 mi away, closer to Marriott, good for souveneirs, small deli and grocery store, prices OK 3) ABC in Queens Market Pl. also1 mi away, good mix, small grocery store, prices fair. Several places had snorkle sets (mask/snorkle/bag etc) for <$10 USD, or BYO from home. Very useful in lagoon. We also bought a cheap styrofoam cooler for day trips (volcano and observatory) and pool hanging. Beverages are high, BYOB. Macaroni Grill (in Queens Plaza) is priced fair although they don't offer the jug of wine on the table : )Activities - none at resort, too much $. Volcano/steam vents/lava tube is good, Observatory is good. Pack a pair of jeans, sneakers, and a hoodie for hiking and high altitude. We did not do the summit tour, high $ to breath thin air. Sunset view from 9000 ft is enough. Night SCUBA dive with mannarays was cool, day dive was so-so. Except for the coral, I saw the same stuff snorkling in the lagoon. Hilo is ok if you want a taste of the local flavor, pretty much like every other beach community I've been to. Souveniers were cheapest over here. The tsunami museum looked interesting but we didn't make it.We are HH gold and used our vouchers for 2 coffees in the AM and Cobb salads (to go) on our day trips. Also hit a Thurs PM HH happy hour for complimentary hordervs and mai-tais. They had a soft opening (no advertising) of their italian resteraunt since the place was 80% full. We had no problem moving around or getting service. Sorry for the spelling/grammar errors, I've been up all night. Aloha ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for 10 days. The hotel is one of the most beautiful properties I have ever seen and the area they are located tends to be the sunniest on the Big Island. There is so much to do right there, you need never leave if you wish, 62 acres of fun, 3 pools, a salt water lagoon and a dolphin pond. We walked along the many stone paths that meander around the property and found hidden treasures of art and sculpture tucked away in little nooks everywhere. If you don\u2019t want to walk there is a train or a boat to carry you from one side of this huge area to another. Every evening a young healthy male in a small wrap would run from one side of the resort (about a mile) to the other lighting the torches and blowing a conch shell to great the sunset. The staff does an incredible job of keeping the grounds pristine, there is never a bit of garbage, a leaf out of place or a path not spotless. The only disappointment was no queen size beds in the double room, very tight was a two full size beds and a family of three. I was very impressed with the staff. We never passed by any staff member without being greeted, from housekeeping to security. My husband and I made a game out of it to see if we could walk by a staff member without a response and we never could. We were also greeted with a \u201cgood morning\u201d or aloha.I would highly recommend this hotel for a Big Island treat. ", " Everything about this hotel is awesome. We are 41, 50, 9, and 6 years old and no issues with walking, waiting for transports, refreshing pools, captive dolphins, or volcanic beaches. Anyone who cannot deal with these should stay at another property. Staff is professional and friendly but unable to deliver on every little request. Parking fees are known prior to booking so no issues with this either. This hotel may not be ideal for parties without children although many seem to coexist well. Just like any location, this property can be relaxing or exciting although heavy party people may want to travel or stay in Kona proper. Must dos include Mauna Kea and Waipio valley, also southern point of the island (southernmost point in 50 states). Beware of strong sun and be prepared for multiple days of cloudy weather. Rent an extended Jeep Wrangler for safety if going off the beaten path, also more fun. Regular-size Wranglers tight on luggage space. Hotel employees good for recommendations for restaurants. We kept supplies for sandwiches, cereal, snacks, and drinks in the room. Not all rooms have microwaves. Pool towel and wristband systems are quirky but doable. Wristbands keep out non-paying visitors so it protects guests. Get desired pool and lagoon spots as early as possible but be courteous not to drop towels and walk away. Go green on room cleaning. Pack light for this hotel. Choose building based on pools, distance from lobby, and desired view; not price. On site restaurants not our preference but we have tried them in the past and they are o.k. If doing a luau, research two or three before deciding. The $25 per day Aloha Passport or $4.50 per day discount for lagoon toys should be considered but be aware that the Aloha Passport applies to all remaining days once signed up but for many is a value. The $4.50 per day program can be applied only on the days needed but must be applied prior to renting toys on those days. New addition 07/11 - new Italian restaurant to fill void for discontinued Donatoni's. ", " Stayed 7 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa with the wife and children ages 7 and 10. This is a truly magnificent hotel. As other reviewers have noted, it's huge. However, there is a monorail and 3 boats that make frequent stops around the hotel to get you to different locations. We never waited more than 15 minutes. It takes a day or so to get familiar with the layout. You really need a rental car if you want to explore the island or go get cheaper food, as it's very overpriced at the hotel. The queens market is a quick car ride of about 2 minutes or a 15-20 minute walk. There is a food court there where cheap eats can be found. (subway, arby's, DQ, etc) We didn't use the valet parking at the hotel, which is an extra $6 per day. It only took me a minute or two to get the rental car from the lot below the lobby. If you don't mind walking a short distance I wouldn't use the valet parking. If you have kids I would recommend staying at the lagoon tower which is close to the lagoon and main pool, which is spectacular. Lots of waterfalls and a cave. My kids loved it. Only issue was the water is very cold and the hot tubs are lukewarm. The cold water feels good on a hot day, but after a few minutes in it my kids were shivering. There is no real beach with sand at the Hilton but a good public beach is a few minutes walk to the Marriott, called A Bay. Nice beach to walk on. Back to the Hilton beach: My son cut his knee badly on the coral on the rocky beach by the Hilton and needed 6 stitches. My advice is don't mess with the beach and spend your time at the pool and the lagoon, which has tons of turtles and fish to see. Again, be careful with the coral at the lagoon, as I cut my finger on it with just a slight accidental touch. Otherwise, this is a great place with fabulous pools, landscaping, and friendly staff. ", " If you read the reviews, you already know that the resort is huge and complies of 5 huge wings., 2 gigantic pools, a children's sand bottom pool, multiple waterfalls and hot tubes, a lagoon with waterfall/boats/turtle/fishes/beach, and a tram+boat transport system. Yes, it takes a long time waiting for the boat or tram, or you can just walk (because it is faster) to your room from the lobby. Yes, food is very expensive and does not taste good. OK, the rooms are pretty standard but large enough in size for a family for 4. Those may not lousy attributes for you ...... but the resort is beautiful. Really. Try walking around during sunset. Try taking pictures there with your kids. It is lovely.... but the resort personals are very helpful. All are very nice. Including the parrot handler in the lobby who has 7-8 parrots.... but the resort is also fun for the kids. My kids loves swimming in the huge connected pools, going under the waterfalls, sliding on the water slides, relaxing in the lagoon, and even seeing fishes jumping out of the water inside the lagoon. Really, it is very nice.However nice the hotel is, it is no match to the nature beauty of Big Island. We loved going out the whole day, then come back to the resort and relax a bit. ", " After reviewing the tripadvisor comments for this hotel, I kept an open mind. At arrival we were helped immediately and with a smile. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view room which we thought we would have to stick our neck out to see the ocean, but the view we got was incredible! (Ocean Tower) All of the staff was friendly and the breakfast employees called us by our names. Our breakfast buffet everyday was included with our package. The omelet and egg station was great! My favorite was the monkey bread! We used the tram everyday. Taking the boat ride throught the resort was great, especially in the evening. We rented snorkel gear one day and snorkled around the lagoon area and at A-Bay. We watched the Dolphin Quest and that was fun!  The comments from previous posters said the restaurant prices were expensive, so we mostly ate off the resort. The Island Marketplace (ABC store) had great sushi and sandwiches. For Father's day dinner we ate at Roy's and Roy's did not disappoint! Overall I gave the Hilton Waikoloa an excellent rating. The views were incredible, the room was excellent, the staff was very friendly and there was so much to do on the premises. I want to return soon!!! ", " The property is very colorful and not overcrowded. Our family was there in March and never had to rush to the pool areas to get a beach chair. There were an ample number of beach chairs in the sun and in the shade. There were slides at the swimming pools and a number of waterfalls. The colorful plants and pools provide a wonderful background for photographs.There is a lagoon with a waterfall. Several turtles leisurely swim and feed in the lagoon. We snorkeled among them every day. There are also paddle boats and water bicycles available to use in the lagoon.From the beach we enjoyed watching the whales breaching during the morning, afternoon, and at sunset. These were memorable experiences.The walkways from the reception desk to the various buildings are lined with numerous oriental and european statues, paintings, puppets, etc. It is like walking through a museum on the way to your hotel room. ", " If you have children, this is the place to be in the Big Island. The layout of the theme park is superb, and despite the available boats and trams guiding visitors to their rooms and other attractions - the whole place is also easily walkable through amazing gardens teeming with wildlife, as well as Disneyesque and oriental statues. The dolphin class was a bit expensive, but in the end, worth every penny. We were taken aback to find that our son enjoyed talking to the parrots in the lobby just as much as swimming with the multiple dolphins! We stayed a week, so took advantage of the laundry room one night - very convenient. The breakfast buffet was fresh with local, Filipino and even Portuguese-influenced entrees. The beach is not a swimming beach (more of a whale watching beach), but there is good swimming in the area. One cannot go to the Big Island without a car. There is a \"beach\" childrens pool, complete with brown sand and near hotel eateries for picnicking as well as a snorkeling lagoon with sea turtles and a man made beach (see pics). Parking was plentiful but parts of the lot do flood a bit. It was a very friendly atmosphere. Upon leaving, the concierge told us we had to visit a Green sand beach in the south of the Island -- if only we had one more day! ", " We were in the Ocean Tower which is the closest to the ocean, got a room facing the ocean with patio. Up higher with a terrace would probably have better views but it was great. Staff extremely helpful, they have a great service where they will lend you a room for free for a couple of hours on the day you leave so you can take a shower before getting on a late night flight. Rooms were normal Hilton fare, but were a bot larger with fridge, walk in closet and sitting area. Free wi fi internet in the lobby only. Self Parking in their big outside parking lot was a bit expensive ($15.00/day). Overall, a great property! ", " My mother, myself and my daughter were here for five nights, staying in the ocean tower/partial ocean view room, clean spacious, great balcony/view. We went to the luau Tuesday night which was remarkable! The swimming pools are fabulous (especially the waterslide:)as well as the shopping. There is so much to do here and the scenery is breathtaking. Our favorite experience was the Kohala Spa, you must take advantage of this on your last day, great way to depart a vacation. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff (in all locations of the hotel) was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, I look forward to returning in a few years. ", " Excellent resort! My wife and I visited Hawaii for an anniversary celebration and we found this place online. We were surprised at how nice it was. ", " From what we were told, this is the largest resort in the Hawaiian Islands. And it is a beautiful property on the ocean. There are three towers, and the rooms are large and very comfortable. The bed was wonderful and housekeeping was excellent. Staff was very friendly and helpful. When we checked in, we mentioned to our check-in attendant that it was our anniversary, and shortly after we got to our room, a complementary bottle of champagne was delivered to us. Really nice! We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, which is near the lobby, the retail shops, and the majority of the action. The other two towers (Palace and Ocean towers) require either a bit of a walk from the lobby, or a short tram ride (free tram shuttles back and forth from one end of the resort to the other, about every 15 minutes). You can also take the free canal boats or walk, but this would be cumbersome with luggage. We had some mobility issues, and the tram worked just fine for us. Nice variety of retail shops on the property. There are small shopping areas near the hotel (king & queen shops) with a hotel tram that shuttles there every 20 minutes for $2 per person each way, but we were disappointed in the Queens shops. The Kings shops are upscale such as Tommy Bahamas, Rolex, Macy's, etc. Food at the resort was very pricey, but that is to be expected in Hawaii. The sunsets are magnificent and dinner on the outdoor area of the Kamuela Provisions Co. restaurant, near the ocean, while expensive, was very romantic at sunset. There is a breakfast buffet (again pricey), but the Lagoon Spoon, near the Lagoon tower, offers dry cereal and breakfast sandwiches at lower cost. The main pool (Kona pool) is very large, with waterfalls and a water slide. We arrived at the pool around 9-9:30am and never had a problem getting lounge chairs. Also adjacent to this pool is the Orchid Marketplace, which offers lunch choices such as pizza, burgers, salads, sushi, etc., or you can walk to the Lagoon grill for lunch or dinner fare (again, burgers, fish, salads, etc.). There is an adult only pool near the Ocean tower; it is much smaller than the main pool, but very quiet. Also a larger pool near the Palace tower, which we did not visit. There is also a beautiful man made lagoon with a beach, where you can snorkel, paddle boat, etc. The resort has pathways that traverse the entire property near the ocean, with lighted torches at dusk, and beautiful views of the Pacific and the lush flowers, palm trees and other plantings at this exquisite resort. We did two excursions, a circle island bus tour, which is a great way to see the island highlights if you are not renting a car. It stopped at the volcano national park, coffee and macadamia nut plantations, orchid and island candy shops, as well as rain forests, waterfalls, etc. The other tour was a sunset champagne ocean tour on a very large catamaran, which included a rib & chicken buffet, free drinks and a wonderful view of the Hawaiian sunset. All in all, this was our third trip to Hawaii (first to the big island) and it exceeded our expectations. Least crowded time to visit the Big Island is either in May (or very early June) or September, when the kids are still in school. We left on June 16th and it was already beginning to get crowded compared to the prior week when we arrived. If you are planning to visit the Big Island, you should seriously consider the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Just great! ", " Our family, which includes 3 children ages 16, 9 and 7, spent 4 wonderful nights at this hotel. It's first class and absolutely beautiful! We will definately stay here again if we return to the Big Island. ", " Loved the activities on the lagoon. We discovered the turtles and kayaked/snorkled next to them. It was an incredible experience - right at the hotel. Beautifully maintained grounds. The shuttle train was convenient. Loved the statutes of chinese horoscope. Especially enjoyed the Buddah Point - where we watched the sunset every night. Gorgeous. It is a huge resort but relaxing and friendly. The room was good size. We valet parked and drove to the beach behind the Queen's marketplace. The ABC store - not your typicall Oahu ABC store - has everything you need/want. We actually ate there most of the time. LOVED it.It was a relaxing beautiful vacation. The hotel was perfect for us. Would go back in a second. ", " Stayed 4 nights in June 2011 and I must say, the place was perfect. The grounds are immaculate, spacious, and well laid out. The pool and lagoon are fantastic for family fun. The pool and grotto are simply amazing! My son will never forget swimming with the dolphins, a must do, I assure you. The beds are fantastic! The food was pricey, although that was anticipated. Hilton is a bit short on kids' menus. All resort staff were friendly, accommodating and pleasant throughout. This is a much better value than the Grand Hyatt (admittedly on Kauai).Darrel McClintock. ", " We stayed at the Hilton June 5-10 and this was our first time to Hawaii. I will start off with- The Pros-This resort like many previous reviews have stated is very BIG. 62 acres consisting of 3 towers, many restaurants, several pools, a lagoon, a dolphin centre, mini golf, a tram and a boat to take you from one side to the other. Having said that, this was one of the most beautiful resorts we have stayed at. It was very clean and staff was always smiling and pleasant.When we pulled into the hotel, we parked our vehicle near the entrance, off loaded our luggage, my wife checked in while I parked the car. Valet is $21 and self parking is $15, I opted for the self as both lots are next to each other and we didn't see the value/need to use valet. Staff is very helpful and I asked them if they could take our luggage to the room. Check-in was quick and we received a room in the Ocean Tower. The Ocean Tower is near Buddha Point, smaller pools, Adult pool and the mini golf. Our room was clean/spacious/comfortable bed and we had no problems with it. We opted for the Aloha Passport and got 2 free drinks each night, internet access, mini golfing, gym passes and 50% off lagoon toys. It was a neat package but if they included discounted parking it would have been much better!! Our room was away from the entrance/elevator area and we did not hear the birds, however you could hear them in the evenings and early mornings near the elevators. If you decide to walk from the Ocean Tower, it is a 10 minute walk to the lobby and a 15 minute walk to the Lagoon pools. There is a screen by each Tower showing when the next Trams/Boat arrives. Lots of pools and chairs and we never felt crammed. There was some kind of convention going on (500+ ppl) but because of the size of the resort, it does not affect you. The lagoon was nice and many activities are available there. The walkways are clean and picturesque and walking by the ocean was peaceful in the evenings. Our package included a buffet breakfast ($24.95 per person value) so it worked out pretty good. Restaurants are a bit pricey, lunch for two at the Lagoon grill would cost us about $45. We did eat there but sometimes would head out to Kings Shops and/or Queens Marketplace. We ate at Island Fish, Romano's and Buzz Sandtrap. Good food overall. We also ate at Ruth's Steakhouse (10 min drive from Hilton) which was one of the best meals. Staff was great, food and drinks were amazing.Cons-Cannot think of many negatives about the resort but two things come to mind-$15 for parking seems a bit unreasonable, especially where this resort is located. One of the staff (young girl serving) at Mahalo lounge was not pleasant. I questioned the strength of my drink after one sip and she immediately defended the bartender by saying, \"Our bartender makes great drinks, you probably have built a tolerance\" and walked away. Overall a great trip. Great for couples, families and extended families. If you are looking for a nightlife, choose another resort or better yet, choose another Island. Will definitely come back!! ", " This makes our 17th time to the Hilton Waikoloa and as a Diamond Member for 10 years and a Platinum with SPG this is our favorite place. They make us feel like royalty. Every employee makes you feel at home. Matt Bell who was driving a boat one night went out of his way to make us and my daughter feel extra special. THey have set the standard in how run a hotel. They are a 10! ", " Just returned from our 8th trip to the beautiful Hilton Waikoloa Village resort. *sigh* I could live there I think...You just can't beat this place. The grounds, pools, restaurants and staff are, in our opinion, WONDERFUL! I guess we like it since we've been going there for 10 years or so now!The staff (THANKS Debra, Julian, George , Rachel and \"Cruz\" and all of the rest of you) are so welcomimg and accommodating. And Charles, your restaurants are superb, as always. The improvements we have seen at the resort over the years are superb. And we noticed the grounds are even more stunning than they were during our trip last August!When you are checking in, it never hurts to ask if there are upgraded rooms available. (We like the Ocean Tower the best.) Usually if they aren't full you can get an upgrade. <l-o-v-e the Kohala Spa ammenities...my husband swears it is the best shampoo in the world> I know people say \"it is really BIG place and hard to get around\". No it isn't \"hard\" to get around. You just have to realize what kind of place you are staying in - take the boat, tram or walk the shorline walkway - that is the \"shortcut\" if you do happen to walk anywhere. And this has got to be one of the best places to go with kids. Lots of families there so it must be popular with them as well as just couples like us! So go, enjoy, kick back at the pool with a cold beverage or have your morning coffee watching the Dolphin Quest dolphins play and don't miss the evening sunset having dinner on the lanai at KPC (a MUST do!). I can't wait to come back again my friends. Aloha ", " Amazing hotel, feels like paradise. Great rooms, clean, spacious, amazing views. Very quiet...Endless activities at the hotel , but also great things to do on the Big Island. Food is maybe the thing we liked less, but go to Kona Brewery a little further or get the Big Island revealed to find little gems on the Island! It worked out very well for us. ", " Recently we had the pleasure of staying 5 nights at the hotel, and absolutely loved everything about our stay there! All the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were comfortable, the view from the Ocean Tower spectacular, the variety of eating establishments unparalleled, and the overall ambience of the village was unforgettable.The design of the village was truly unique: from the beautiful walking trails, to the impressive variety of artwork, mixed in with tropical pleasures like a dolphin pool, multiple swimming pools for the entire family, as well as variety of shops, restaurants, and entertainment. The options of riding the train throughout the village or of taking the boat around the hotel grounds were unique and brought smiles to many a face. We also enjoyed the luau, spending a few dollars extra for the upgraded version where we were able to eat and drink to our fill was wonderful!Our stay wad relaxing, the weather was wonderful, and going off season made it seem as if we were often alone in our Hawaiian paradise. ", " My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa from May 7th to 14th and had a wonderful time. I suppose the best way to do this review is by giving the pros and cons of this resort as we saw them. First Let me begin by apologizing for the long review, I wanted to be helpful if anyone was thinking of staying here. First the pros: The resort was gorgeous. The gardens were impeccably kept, there was plenty of wildlife, beautiful statues, art, pools, flowers, waterfalls, trails, natural lagoons, you name it. Everything contributed to the beauty of this resort.  The resort was very spacious. Some people on previous reviews found this to be a negative. We did not. It\u2019s impossible to put all the pools, the lagoons, the gardens, the nature paths, the spa and everything that makes this resort special, in a small property. That would make it a hotel and not a resort. Make no mistake about it; this was a gorgeous, big, beautiful, resort.  The pools were great! There are a number of pools throughout the resort . The Kohala Pool and Kona pool s both have slides and their own character. The Kohala pool was more whimsical, almost Disney\u2019es. We liked the Kona located at the Lagoon Towers the best. It\u2019s probably the biggest, with large waterfalls and a high water slide. A small, no thrills adult\u2019s only pool is located at the ocean towers that offer a quite place to sit and relax. There is also a protected lagoon with a beach for swimming and snorkeling. This was also our favorite for tranquility and of course the snorkeling. We saw all sorts of fish, turtles and eels. There are plenty of chairs for everyone in whatever pool you choose, but if you want a covered cabana type seat I suggest you make a claim by placing your towel early in the morning as they are free and on a first come first serve basis.  Our room was impeccably clean, which I expected for a Hilton property. It had a large flat screen TV with plenty of free and pay per view channels. The d\u00e9cor in our room was somewhat dated but we didn\u2019t mind. The view of the ocean from our room was very good. We stayed in 5053 Ocean Tower. If you have a choice to stay in Ocean Towers try to get a room on third floor and above and room number from 60 to 86\u2019s. They seemed to have the best view. DO NOT get a room on 1st floor on Ocean Towers. It is a sub floor since the 2nd floor is main floor. I do not know about the other towers. One note you should keep in mind. The Ocean Towers have the best ocean views but is located furthest from the lobby. The Lagoon Towers are more conveniently located, closest to the lobby and parking lot. I did not visit inside the palace towers so I have no idea what their attraction would be.  The tram, is a rail system that runs the length of the property, from Ocean Towers to Lagoon Towers. This too some people in previous reviews found too slow and untimely. We did not. It runs every 10 minutes and if you are too tired to walk, sit on a bench and wait for it. If you rather walk, as we did many times, it\u2019s a nice walk along corridor lined with exquisite art. From Ocean Towers to the lobby is a 10-12 minute walk. From Palace Towers is about a 5 minute walk and from Lagoon Towers a 1-2 minute walk. From lobby to the parking lot is a 1-2 minute walk.  The boats run the length of the property inside a naturally crafted waterway. They are slow and I don\u2019t suggest taking them if you are in a hurry. But if you want a casual, romantic ride, take the boat and enjoy the scenery. If you run across Thumper, wave to him for me.  The Queen\u2019s Marketplace and King\u2019s Shops nearby. I added this as a pro since it will save you money and is conveniently located near the hotel. It\u2019s a must stop for everything from groceries, to prepared foods, to liquor, to souvenirs, to everyday essentials. Also, there are plenty of restaurants and casual shopping located at both of these malls. Neutrals: The Internet is wired to each room, but if you are not a Hilton Member it\u2019s expensive. The good news is, there is WiFi in all common places (pools, restaurants, lobbies etc,) and in my case, I was on the 5th floor and could get WiFi internet access in my room from the common area below. My suggestion is to wait until you get your room before paying for internet access you might not need.  The luau was, well, average. The food was average, the entertainment was average, but the desserts were excellent. In my case the luau was free as part of a package. I would have been disappointed if I had to pay $119 for each person. We did upgrade to the Alii seating for $26 each, which includes a table close to the stage and bringing the food to your table. I thought that was worth it, but not if I had to pay full price.  Cons: The parking is a rip off. Come on, $15 a day to park and $21 a day valet? The parking lot is wide open and easy to get in and out, so we chose to park ourselves. The valet parking is only a few yards closer and we didn\u2019t feel it was worth the extra $6 + tip a day. But that was our preference, you might find it worth the extra expense.  The food was expensive. The food is expensive all over Hawaii, so I didn\u2019t have a problem so much as I did with Breakfast at Water\u2019s Edge . The Breakfast was $25 for each person and the food was subpar. I just don\u2019t see a family of 4 spending over $100 + tip for an egg omelet some fruit and maybe a pastry. The good news, there are restaurants in the Queen Marketplace and King Shops within a short distance from the Hotel. They\u2019re located on the same road and you will see them as you first turn towards the hotel. There is also a Gourmet Island Market in Queen\u2019s Mall that has everything!  There are not many privileges for being a Hilton Honors member. Instead of a free breakfast you will receive a $10 voucher each for you and your wife. Since breakfast for you and your wife will run to $51.98 + tip, you do the math. And for those of you that stayed at Hilton Garden Inn\u2019s or Embassy Suites, the breakfast is very similar.In closing, we loved our stay and would gladly come back for another stay. The few cons were hardly a deal breaker. I don\u2019t believe you will find a more beautiful property on the Island. Fluter ", " We stayed here only one night before our rental house was ready - easily could have stayed longer. We wanted a resort experience and we got it! Have to say we were astonished by the place.which is so much bigger, more interesting and beautiful than we imagined. Sprawling but so picturesque with sculpture throughout the gorgeous landscaped grounds. And yet easy to get around - you can traverse the 60+ acre property by tram/train which comes frequently, by a slower but enjoyable boat (2pm-10pm) and you can stroll the paths too. We did all. There's something interesting to see at every turn, including dolphins being trained. We were in the Ocean Tower - \"towers\" are not towering, only a few stories high - and it was lovely and quiet. There is water everywhere - swimming pools, hottubs, waterfalls, an enormous central lagoon for snorkeling, kayaking and pedal boating, and then the vast ocean always is in view. We loved the water slides! We had a fantastic dinner of fresh oysters, island fish and delicious wilted spinach at oceanfront Kamuela Provision Company, one of the many fine on-site restaurants. You would not need a car (parking is expensive) if you stayed here since they have tours if desired, and a golf course next door! We are recommending this place to anyone who will listen. Save your Hilton points and get an upgrade as we did to a spacious suite! ", " It is unbelievably superb! Their lagoon where you can snorkel and even paddle/kayak in had HUGE turtles! colorful big fish and warm waterfalls! i didn't need to go to kaleakekua bay since all of these were just in our front yard =) the museum walkway was totally impressive (and i bet expensive)! the numerous pools, tram/boat just to travel WITHIN the hotel complex were just amazing! their valet service was great and we didn't need to tip each time we took the car (numerous times per day) since we tipped at the end of the vacation. what a great vacation! ", " It does take a long time to walk from your room to hotel lobby. Basically it takes us 45 mins if you are at the Ocean tower block to get the restaurants thats outside the hotel. It was to expensive to eat in the hotel so thats why we adventure outside. Even those restaurants were not cheap. It special, I loved sipping my cocktail when watching the Dolphins, The lagoon area is very beautiful and we highly recommend that you go into Lagoon early in the morning as the Turtles are still there. The turtles move on as soon as the Lagoon area gets busy. ", " I'm a HIlton Diamond traveler. I asked for, and received, an upgraded room, PRIOR to my visit. I traveled on points entirely. First, this hotel is very big as noted. 15 minutes from the car to our room in the far section of the ocean tower. Make sure you bring everything you need for the trip you're making, you don't want to go back to the room.We arrived early, around noon. Told we might have to wait until 2 for our room, which was fine as check-in is 3. Room was ready at 1:25 when we checked.We had no issue with noise - we requested a quiet room ahead of time and received it, 5061 in the last section of the Ocean Tower. Unbelieveable view, great room. This hotel has a great staff and is a great facility. We spent a lot of time away from it exploring the island. Maid service was perfect, pool and lagoon very nice. With the great art collection, extensive landscaping, boats and trams, it coudl be overwhelming to some. Minor negatives like in-room coffee had powdered cream and not liquid cream, but we acquired some and it wasn't an issue. Business center is run by a third party and charges for everything. In addition to Conceirge, they have a separate service run by HIlton Grand Vacations (yes, timeshares) that offers trip advise. Our person, Robin, didn't try to sell us anything, barely mentioned that if we attended the sales pitch (we did not) we'd get discounts (not worth the 90 minutes of our valuable Hawaii time). Pool bars and lagoon are run by Ocean Sports, but they didn't try to sell us anything. We rented our snorkeling gear prior to arriving from a third party for much, much less, and didn't buy any services while at the hotel. While the trams can breakdown, and the boats are slow, remembering that it's a nice walk and you're in Hawaii and not rushing around makes it something you take in stride. The staff, including the management team, really understand their customers and cater to them. Those that come in with an attitude of \"what are you going to do for me now\" probably will find fault. Those that come to enjoy, will. We had a memorable experience and would love to return some day. ", " It's so interesting to see how one hotel can conjure up such opposing views from visitors, but we loved it. I agree that the additional costs (parking, snorkel rental, etc) are outrageous, but we are finding that you can't travel to any big hotel anymore without encountering this. And we also had a roach in our room, but compared to the the huge tarantula on a previous trip to Hawaii, this was nothing (btw, tarantula was not at a hilton). They come with the island and we've had things in our rooms in Mexico and Costa Rica too. And the service was so-so, nothing to complain about but not to rave about either. But still, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here, it's just so beautiful. The kids loved the pools and slides and I especially loved the lagoon and ocean views (we avoided the dolphins as we don't believe in caging them). My favorite part was getting up early to be the first snorkeling in the lagoon. I was surprised how many beautiful fish, eels, etc were there and I loved swimming with the turtles. Yes, the dinners were expensive, but again nothing more than most upper-end restaurants today. Most of our meals were great. I agree with others that the KPC meal was our least favorite, and most expensive, although the sunset there was gorgeous and the dessert and bar was the best. And maybe we just picked a great week to go, but it wasn't crowded at all! There were always plenty of chairs around the pool and lagoon, never a long line at the big slide, and every night after 5:30 we practically had the pool to ourselves. Yes, the hotel is huge, but with such lovely grounds to walk on who cares? We only took the tram and boat once to say we did, but I enjoyed walking much more. Movie night was fun, and we got plenty of use out of the pool tables. True, there isn't a good beach here for swimming (as with most hotels on this island), but Hapuna is only a 10 minute drive and it's gorgeous. And I found the coastline here to be just beautiful. So lovely to walk it during sunset. It may have also been good for snorkeling but I didn't get the chance. I hear the other side had a noisy bird problem, but we were at the Lagoon tower and it was very quiet. Never heard the people next door either. My final statement is the cost of the room... we found this to be MUCH cheaper than the comparable Westin we stayed at in Maui 4 years ago and we had a much bigger room here which was very clean and nicely decorated. If we go back to the big island, we'll definitely stay here again. ", " The start of stay you go via the train/ boat to your Tower ! the morning chirping of the wildlife around you, was what making me wake up @5am... and sleep back @7am. hotel has its own dolphin....s.. too good. the landscape is serene from gardens to boat ride to long walkways of ART work to fishes in small ponds. Awazing..stay even if you on a company summit!! ", " As reported hundreds of times the bird noise is horrendous. I spent 8 nights in the Ocean Tower and could only sleep with pillows covering my ears. When my flight was canceled because of the tsunami I returned to the Hilton and spent one night in the Lagoon Tower and had no problem with bird noise at all. The distance from reception to self-parking took less than 5 minutes. The only long walk was from the lobby to Ocean Tower, about 15 minutes. Take your time and wait for the tram. Did not eat at the Hilton at all. Too many good restaurants within fairly short driving distances at much more reasonable prices. The art work is magnificent. All of Waikoloa village is proof of what money and machines can do to a lava bed. The entire middle coast of the big island is one big clinker. ", " After reading the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, we were a bit anxious about our visit. Especially because when we checked in we were expecting to get upgraded due to my Diamond status with Hilton - which it sounded like Diamond members often received. However, apparently there was a HUGE group on the Island (5000+) and they had taken all the rooms so we were left with a basic room. And when we got to our room it was late and we couldn't see anything so we figured we received a room with no view.However, upon waking we were pleasanly surprised we could see the ocean (our advice is to ask for the highest room possible to avoid any potential tree blockage). I will admit that in the ocean tower the birds can be annoying (they wake at 4am and are loud), but if you pack a small fan it will drown out the noise. And the room was very nice and clean. Obviously as a Diamond I travel a lot and was not disappointed.As for service, originally I was going to give it a 4 out of 5 because we are used to Mexico where they always seem to want to please you at every turn. However, upon reflection of our visit, I couldn't really come up with anything they did wrong. We had a couple small issues and they resolved them immediately. I guess my only complaint was that at checkout there was a big group checking in and they only had a few attendants so poor staffing planning, but again having to wait a few extra minutes was the worst we encountered. If you want a small, quiet resort, this is not for you. However, my wife and I like to take long morning walks in beautiful scenery so this resort was perfect. The grounds are very well manicured and the view is amazing. Yes you have to plan an extra 10-15 minutes to make it back to the lobby via either a longer walk or waiting for the tram or boat, but we just looked at it as we are on vacation with no agenda or appointments so we didn't mind waiting and watching the scenery.Also, my wife and I like to meet other people so whether it was at the pool, on the tram or sitting at dinner, guests at the resort are very friendly and outgoing so you get to meet a lot of amazing people. I guess it is a testament to the resort that everyone is having such a great time they let their normal guard down and walk around saying \"hi\" to everyone else.The restaurants are also all amazing, and again the reviews all said they closed early but during our visit they were all open until 11pm. And as for price, they weren't cheap, but we soon found out it really wasn't the resort - NOTHING in Hawaii is cheap. Heck a couple burgers and beers would cost you $40-$50 in town. And when you add in the ambience and the service, they were all well worth it (I am in the restaurant business so I am very critical and I was pleased). Plus, to help keep costs down, we recommend going to Costco and getting things like bottled water, booze, fruit, snacks, etc. We then used the $10 Hilton Honor certificates for breakfast, ate snacks from Costco for lunch, and then ate at the resort for dinner -worked well. Bring a small cooler on wheels to take down to the pool or lagoon.Speaking of, the best part of the entire resort is the lagoon area. I had never really snorkeled but wanted to learn, and in the lagoon you can do it for free if you have your own equipment (we recommend going to Costco and getting the US Divers Adult set for $39). There are all sorts of fish and even sea turtles which you can swim right next to. And while we didn't do the Dolphins since we had done this in Mexico, I highly recommend after talking to others that did, as you really get up close in their environment as opposed to us who did it in a big tank. And even if you don't want to do the dolphin encounter, defintely come down at 8:30am when they feed and do training with the dolphins since you can sit and have breakfast and watch for free.As for the Luau, we actually suggest going off-property. The Mauna Lea is an upscale resort only about 10 miles North and they have an amazing Luau right out by the ocean. Plus with the coupon in the Big Island Coupon book (available everywhere), the second person is 50% off. And space is limited, the food is amazing and unlimited, and the show is authentic.Cool things to do on the island - Dick Butkus and Mai Tai's at LuLu's in town, Snorkel with the Manta Rays at night with Big Island Divers, day excursion snorkeling with SeaQuest, and driving down to the southern end of the island. ", " When it comes to visiting the island of Hawaii, this resort offers almost more than one family can do in a weeks time. Yes, you have to pay extra for parking and yes your rooms are a long way away. When you book your rooms you know that ahead of time, so I don't understand the complaints from so many people about these problems. When visiting this resort, it is not intended for a fast paced lifestyle that so many experience back home. It is intended for you to slow down and enjoy yourself. Plan for waiting on the tram or boat or walking distances to get to your room or to the lobby. The designers of this hotel did a great job of creating a place that unique only to this resort. The artwork definitely shows the asian influence on Hawaii. There's many pools and some good restaurants. Be prepared to pay out the nose if ou decide to eat at the resort. There's a couple of nice restaurant in King's Village which is a short drive from the resort. These weren't here 5 years ago, so now the restaurants at the resorts have competition. Also, do not go to the Luau at the resort. It is awfully over priced and there are some really good ones in Kona that are much cheaper. The service was fantastic. Since the economy took a nose dive, there were very few people there compared to the time before in 2005 when I went before. We asked for an upgrade when we got there, and they gave us a master suite with 5 balconies and a huge living room 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. We had only asked for a standard room on our reservation. Be sure to simply ask for an upgrade; you may be surprised. The staff was great: a guy that worked in the information/travel office let us borrow his snorkel equipment so we wouldn't have to pay for any to take off the property. He then told us about a secret black sand beach that was great for snorkling only about 10 minutes from the resort. Are things expensive in Hawaii and this resort, sure. But to have a luxurious place to come back to after a long day exploring Hawaii... priceless. ", " High end and very very nice. CONS: The tram and boats were over kill. The $15 per day parking charge was not appreciated. Food is very expensive. Previous reviews were not so good so we didn't even try it. We don't approve of human and dolphin encounters. The $98 luau would rate 3/5. Check Fodor's or Frommer's for an alternative choice. PLUSES: Location is exquisite. Everything is always pristine. We upgraded from a \"resort\" room and it was very, very nice. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower (little or no bird noise). Statuary and art is off the charts. We saw whales from Buddha Point. This hotel would be a great place for families with children - so much to do. Feed them from the Deli at the Queen's Market Place which is expensive (as everything is in Hawaii but much cheaper than the Hilton).. The panni sandwiches are so large that I ate half the next day. Cost? $10. ", " This hotel is like a dreamland, it has everything including multiple swimming pool - including an adults only pool, what a great idea! There is a dolphin swim area but you can come and watch the dolphins for free at any time of day or night with a great view. The only downside to the resort is the price of the restaurants for dinner (there are lots of options for lunch). if you have a hire car this is no problem because there are plenty of places to drive to for food, including restaurants and fast food just 5 mins away. We had an amazing time here and will definately stay here when we come back to the Big Island! ", " stayed for ten days in ocean tower, traveled with a 12 year old and 4 year old and they loved the pools and lagoon. the breakfast buffet was a overpriced joke. 25.00 eacha 4 year old ate about a dollars worth of food. best place to eat was a little restaurant about a block away at the golf coarse, can not remember name but just ask the staff at hotel all know of it.\" one gal said thats is where everyone that works at hotel gets lunch and i could see why, the best beach on the island is north about 3 miles sea turtles, caves to explore bbq hut, easy walk and awsome swimming with shallow outlay perfect for kids. best food we ate was in town at a restaurant named bongo bens, great breakfast and cheap. also in same area was little chinese place that was very good.costco in afternoons for pizza, and if you plan to buy local nuts or coffee then costco will save you a ton. huge mac nut selection and coffee selection. take the coffee road and tour the plantations even our four year old found this cool because you get to pick some coffee at most of them. the volcano is also neat to see on ground but the air tours you really get to see what your looking for\"lava\" for us anyway. if you plan on any shows then the one at fairmont orchid is the best, in past 5 years we have been to almost every nite luau show on big island and this was the best luau by far, the food was excellent. also at hilton pay the extra for valet parking, the extra 4 dollars is so worth it to just pull up to front door of hotel and just leave the car, and call down 10 min before leaving and car is rite outside lobby. self parkers have to walk quite far away ", " Yes, the food on site is expensive and at one or two places does not meet expectations of excellence. But all in all, you don't have to go all over the island, everything is right there.We stayed in the Lagoon Tower and if your an early morning person you will have no problem with their 6am wake up call from the birds outside your door. Everyone at the Hilton was extremely nice and helpful. I would go back in a heart beat and would highly recommend it to my friends. Thank you Hilton. ", " Upon entering this beautiful hotel we were speechless. It had every amenity you could think of. Plenty to do and perfect for family enjoyment. We swam with the sea turtles, fish and eels in their own private lagoon. My 5 year old was in heaven! It was a very large property with a boat to take you around and also a tram that can transport from one side of the property to another. The staff was friendly and responsive. I would definitey stay here again. ", " We stayed here four nights before joining the Kona Aggressor for a week's diving. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities except for the breakfast, as we had very little time, and the Big Island has a lot to see. As a Hilton Honors Diamond Member, I was upgraded into a very nice oceanfront room in the Lagoon Tower. Everything appeared to be in good shape, and service was also very good. We would return. We learned elsewhere on the island that the \"natives\" call the place \"Disneyland.\" ", " My husband and I had not taken a honeymoon yet and lucky me I won a trip on the radio to you guessed it, Hilton Waikoloa Village! I could not believe it when I arrived! It was magical!! When we arrived in our room, which was on the ground floor facing the ocean and golf course, we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in our room cause the grounds are amazing! Boat ride to your room, pools and waterslides everywhere. Snorkeling with the fish and turtles. Swimming with dolphins. Massage at the Spa. Oceanside dining. The people that work there are all so nice and always say Aloha when they see you. Heck,. I wa saying it by the end of the trip. My husband and I had such an amazing time we stayed an extra night. ( not on the radio station). Only one thing I would skip if you are looking to save a little money. Don't eat at the breakfast buffet. Way too overpriced. Nothing spectacular food wise. Average. Thankfully we had a car and could venture out. We also stocked our in room fridge the first day we arrived. ", " Beautiful! Everything about this resort was great. I can't think of one thing that could have been better. We slept the best we have in years. Very comfortable, relaxing and warm. We even got to watch the Packers play. ", " Great place to relax and spend time with the family. We have four young children, and found that there was plenty of things to do for them and us. They did the dolphin encounter and i had to say was worth evey cent we paid. They are still talking about the experience to people back home in oz, so i say money well spent. Also seeing whales breach from the property was a highlight. Wish we were still there. ", " My wife and I stayed here for an eight-day vacation this month. While not perfect, this resort met and exceeded our needs. We'll return.I rated it excellent because it is. It offers a lot more than other hotels elsewhere and helped us have what we consider a great vacation. We felt the resort is perfect for married couples like us (we also met others) and families with kids. Not many resorts seem ideal for both.We found there's a TON of things we wanted to do on the Big Island (snorkeling, helicopter, coffee plantations, Hilo, volcano, hiking, etc.). We left with a list of things we still wanted to do. Our idea of a vacation wasn't sitting on a beach for a week and then flying home so we really got to explore the island. We also dedicated our entire week to staying at the resort so we didn't visit another island.We went to the nearby Marriott for lunch and it seemed lackluster because during our brief visit, we saw the majority of the property. Its pool area, while described as heated, is smaller and also extremely crowded. For a shorter stay, I would recommend this property higher, however, because it is smaller and perhaps more convenient. It is also closer to shops and restaurants.Other reviewers compare the Hilton to a Disney hotel property because of the tram and boats in particular. Having stayed at two of Disney's best hotels (Grand Californian and Animal Kingdom Lodge), that seems like a relatively fair comparison, definitely in a good way.We benefited from the resort with a longer stay (8 nights) than we likely would have had with a three-night stay. The long commute to the room may have been more frustrating if we were shorter on time. We could relax and stroll.First, a few negatives or to address others' negatives:-- Service: Our service overall was good, not great. We had great service for the most part but had both a bartender and waitress that disappeared or struggled. We also had a luau booking problem (see below).-- Size of resort/long commutes: The resort is huge. But we saw that as a good thing because it made us feel like we had a ton of options. Even though we stayed in the Ocean Tower, we liked the option to take the tram, boat or a nice long walk on a covered path. We didn't have a problem with being far from the lobby -- it was nice to get some exercise and stroll through the beautiful resort . We also didn't feel the self-parking lot was too far from the lobby as others have. It's a brief walk out the door through the valet driveway, through a garden path and then you're at the lot -- 2 minutes tops. The only time I didn't like the resort's size was when I left my room key in the car when I got to the hotel room door but the wife bailed me out. Phew!-- Prices: This is a luxury resort in a top vacation destination. A price for a Coke is more here than the price back home. We knew that and expected it. We went to the local market and bought food to eat in the room when we wanted to save money and didn't want to rely on the resort's restaurants for every food and beverage. It's a no-brainer and we saw others load their groceries on the tram to take to their rooms.-- Unheated pools: We didn't understand why the pool wasn't heated but we just went to the beach and did snorkeling there. We also used the jacuzzis twice. There were fewer people in the pool because it's so cold, at least during the winter month we visited.-- No beach: The resort doesn't have a beach but compromises with a small lagoon which does the same trick. The nearby Marriott has a beach to walk to but it's also accessible via car from the Hilton. We weren't all about the beach so we were OK.-- Staffing: They could use more staff because it's possible to arrive or leave with just the busy valet as the only staff to greet. The front desk is far from the door. (I like being greeted apparently.) We were at a jacuzzi late at night that was open until 11 p.m. and there were drunk college students climbing around the cave at the pool. They could have killed themselves by falling and there were no staff around to monitor the situation. There were also some cocktail glasses left at the pool for hours. They need more staff to do sweeps and for cleaning and maintenance, especially at the pool at night where a lawsuit could happen.-- One error: We made a reservation for the luau on our arrival with the concierge in our tower. The woman in our tower asked us our last name twice though she held a paper with our name. She confirmed our reservation. Several days later on the day or our luau, my wife told me to confirm our reservation and it hadn't been made but there were plenty of openings so they booked us. We would have not attended the luau if there weren't still availability and it was both something we were looking forward to and part of our package.Now, for the positives:-- Cleanliness: The place is immaculate but we never saw people cleaning.-- Area/Location: There are two major outdoor malls in the area for shopping, groceries and restaurants. They're walking distance or available by car. Waikoloa Beach is a luxury area. The resort sits on a property with the ocean to the west and north. It's also convenient to get to other places on the island. -- Room: The room size was really big and we were very comfortable for the week. It had a king size bed and sofa.-- Staff: Though not always great, the staff was super friendly. Even though we had a few aforementioned issues, our opinion of the staff was overall positive. -- Adult pool: We didn't have kids with us and there were few because we went off-season while kids are in school. However, we appreciated an adult pool in our tower so we could relax.-- Options: There are tons of options for things to do in the resort. It's a mini-city so there's always something to do there.-- Food/Restaurants: We liked the food and bars overall. We had some nice cocktails when we wanted them and several good meals. There were a lot of places to watch the NFL playoffs, a priority for one day for me. We also liked the coffee stand near our room for an occasional coffee or ice cream.-- Concierges: There are concierges throughout the hotel to advse on island activities and restaurants. I thought that is great -- they're not there to advise you to spend money in their resort necessarily but to go out and have a great vacation on the island. I've never seen so many helpful concierges at a hotel property. I found them to really benefit our overall vacation plans and made us want to return.One thing we discovered that hasn't been mentioned is the resort offers a discount for those who sit through their time share sales pitch. The presentation was exactly as we were told it would be both in content and length and once we realized we couldn't afford it, there was no pressure. If we had the funds, we probably would have considered it more.Overall, this is a great resort and we look forward to returning. ", " We stayed here for a wonderful 7 day vacation over New Years. The week was without a doubt the best vacation we have had and we plan on returning as soon as possible! Just a few points:1) Yes, the resort is huge but you get a feeling that you have the place to yourself. Even though we were there during the peak time of the year you would have thought we owned the place.2) The tram and boats are a fun aspect of the report but it is faster to walk. Remember you are on vacation and you\u2019re supposed to slow down and enjoy yourself. One thing we did notice was that the resort didn\u2019t seem to be setup for people with strollers. We actually overheard quite a few parents complaining as they were hauling strollers up and down stairs. 3) No beach but who cares you have a Lagoon! We woke up early every morning and went right to the Lagoon. We swam with turtles, fish, and eels. Yes, it may not have been as clear as the ocean but where else can you walk right out your room and swim with at least 4 turtles? 4) The pools are old and the Jacuzzis are cold. It says something when the Lagoon is about 10 degrees warmer than the pools. 5) This was the first vacation in over 10 years where we didn\u2019t have to get up early to get a pool side chair. Again, it was as if we owned the place. 6) Our stay included a free buffet breakfast every morning. The food was great, staff was fun to talk to and we loved the smoothies but we would never pay for it. It\u2019s just not worth it. We just can\u2019t say enough about this place. We absolutely love the resort and we could never imagine staying anywhere else. Can\u2019t wait to return! ", " I'll get the negatives about this hotel out straightaway as they absolutely did not impact on on our experience. First of all there is no beach. There is a man-made lagoon that gets rather busy and is definitely not the same as the sea although you can snorkel and see a good selection of sea life. The swimming with the dolphins experience is absolute robbery. I wouldn't mind paying all that money if it was worth it, but paying hundreds of dollars just to stand in the water with the dolphins and touching them a handful of times is not what I had in mind. The trainers arrived very late and were not organised not seeming to know what they were going to do next. No matter how tempting it is, don't waste your money on this!Service at the bars was appallingly slow and staff wasn't great either, although the drinks and cocktails we had were really nice.And now for what left a lasting impression: we only stayed 2 nights at this hotel, but I wish we could have stayed at least a week. This resort gives you the feeling of being in a different world where you very easily forget everything about work and the worries of life.The resort is huge so it doesn't feel crowded. There are so many pools that you can take your pick of which one you want to use and sunbeds are plentiful although well spaced. So few people around make you feel like you have your own personal pool.The resort is absolutely stunning. You can walk around for hours just being amazed by the views and the art that is on show absolutely everywhere. If you don't fancy the walk you can take the shuttle train or have a more relaxed transfer using the boats.We stayed in one of the amazing presidential suites.The room was impeccably clean and furnished with impeccable taste. The view from the balconies was amazing so we spent many hours in the early morning and evening just staring out at the ocean.The restaurants were as overpriced as you would expect in any similar resort so no surprises there. We ate in resort once and had a lovely experience. The atmosphere was relaxed, the service great and the food delicious. If you don't fancy any of the many eating options, there are 2 centres very nearby where you can find many shops and restaurants. This is definitely the perfect place for couples looking for a relaxed and secluded holiday. ", " Stayed here 15 years ago and it was just as good second time round. Fabulous lagoon to snorkel in with turtles and tropical fish, good pools with water slides and nice restaurants. There are also two shopping complexes nearby with good shops and restaurants. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable about local areas and can arrange sightseeing trips. Room was great, even though view of golf course rather than sea view, bed was very comfortable. We stayed here 7 nights and though it was expensive it was worth it. ", " This was our fourth visit to this resort in the last two years. The property is absolutely beautiful. If any one has complaints about this property, they would also complain about winning the lottery. In my opinion, if someone writes a bad review about this resort, you should ignore it. We have visited the Four Seasons and Fairmont Orchid here on the Big Island. They are nice, but they do not hold a candle to the Hilton. We were impressed that most of the staff at the Hilton remembered us and some remembered us by name. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the staff always greeted us with a Merry Christmas or a Happy New Year. We went to the gym every morning at 5 a.m. and could see the staff at work cleaning and keeping the resort at its best. Our room was gorgeous and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job of keeping us supplied with towels and other necessities. We even ran into friends we met that were there when we were last year! The food in the restaurants on the property was always as we ordered. We had a sunset dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company & the meal was excellent! We ate lunch at the Lagoon Grill each day and were met with very friendly staff. We attended a luau on New Year's Eve and had a great time. The food was delicious and the entertainment was excellent. We did have a waiter that left a lot to be desired, but when we brought this to the attention of the staff, we were immediately issued a credit. This is our preference for a stay on the Big Island even though we have stayed at the Prince Kahuna, the Sheraton, Kona Coast Resort, and others. None can beat the Hilton! ", " We stayed at the Hilton December 4th thru December 11th. We booked our trip with Apple and upgraded to an ocean view room. We were in room 6327 in the Lagoon Tower and had a wonderful veiw of the ocean and the dolphin pool to the right. We had a Aloha Pass included in our vacation which gave us complimentary breakfast at the Big Island buffet. The breakfast was very good and included smoothies that I am now missing and yummy pancakes or waffles that you can order from the waitperson that are not on the buffet station. Our room was made up every morning while we were at breakfast. Our room was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. We did have problems with the internet access that was free included in the Aloha Pass but was fixed when we called the front desk. I can't say enough good things about the hotel staff. They were all very friendly and accomidating. The hotel grounds are big but not as bad as people make them sound. We enjoyed walking around after breakfast and taking in the beauty of the resort and we could always hop on the boat back to our room. We rented a car and used the valet which was worth the extra money. Just call ahead from the room and the car was waiting when we got to the lobby. A bay is the beach closest to the hotel and had beautiful sunsets. We saw the entire Island during our week including the Volcano and a black sand beach which was worth a visit. Lots of beautiful beaches with turtles and great snorkeling. We enjoyed eating at some of the local places but there are some nice places to dine in the King and Queen shopping centers. Also enjoyed Buzz's Sand Trap for happy hour and got a kick out of the owner Dickie. The only negative is that the pools are cold and that we didn't stay on vacation longer! We loved the Aloha Spirit. ", " The hotel is in an interesting part of the Big Island and it is a good base to use. Service is spotty and we had some issues but none that would be the basis for general conclusions. We parked in the self-park area, They charge $15/day for parking instead of the usual resort fee, probably because the state is cracking down on mandatory fees. We chose not to do any of the voluntary fees and were glad we made that decision. Our Hilton Card gave us access to the gym. Our room in the Ocean Tower was fine - large and with a decent view and fine bedding. We were near the trees where the java mynah birds gather for their noise making, It only occurs at dusk and dawn and we had no problem sleeping. The birds are everywhere are lovely and add to the experience. We bought food to last our stay for breakfast and lunch in a store in Waimea on our way in from Hilo and had dinner in restaurants in the nearby shopping centers. (Sansei was outstanding and Merriman's was fine.) The food prices in the hotel were high but the location necessitates it. We limited our internet use to the free wireless in the lobby bar and had no problems, We unloaded our bags at the entrance and parked. It was a five minute walk back - faster than using the valet. Any luggage would be transferred via underground conveyors - there are no vehicles anywhere except the trains and boats that shuttle between buildings. This creates a nice atmosphere but also means that no one can drive off with the any of the amazing art collection. The art is simply astounding - it is all original and mostly antique, inside and outside, everywher, including every floor of the hotel and alongside every pool. Beats any art museum - you could spend days looking at the collection. There are three clusters of rooms, none at the main entrance. You can take the train with your luggage and the boats (on tracks) are Disney-esque, But their routes are winding and service infrequent so you can walk easily by amazingly scenic paths over bridges and behind waterfalls that are much more direct. The lagoon offers the only ocean-type swimming, There is sand and chairs but no waves and the place is a traffic mess of various water vehicles that they rent to people who have little competence. While you can swim and snorkel in the lagoon, and there are some coral reefs on the far side, you wind up dodging people on water bikes, paddle boards, kayaks and other junk that would never be allowed on a public beach. We were there for real beaches anyway and the hotel provides nice towels from the valet parking attendants to take with you to the beach (if you have no car they provide a bus). A Bay is the closest beach. It is where the Marriott is located. It has gray sand and lots of trees and crowds. It is better than the lagoon but not worth the trouble. So we continued out to Hwy 19 and drove north to Hapuna Beach State Park.. This was gorgeous and there are change rooms and showers. While there a lots of people there, it has plenty of room and there is a lifeguard. No kayaks or hard boards are allowed. There are few waves and no reef. The next day we went to Kekaha Kai State Park, which is south toward Kona. This is a favorite with local people with excellent waves and only boogie boards allowed. The next day we tried to go on Mauna Kea beach but the hotel that fronts on it wouldn't let us in because the lot was full. So we looked at Spencer's Beach - not at all attractive. So we asked about the famous Beach 69 and was told how to get there. It's on the same road as Hapuna Beach, old Puako Road, at Waialea Bay, If you go to Google Maps and look at Satellite view, follow the road south from Hapuna and you will see where the parking lot it. It is the first paved road that branches toward the ocean from Old Puako Road coming from Hapuna. You can also access it from the south. This is a great beach with coral reefs, gentle waves and lots of shade. There are even change rooms and showers. So - we were happy with the hotel as a base. If we were constrained to spend our days there it would be tolerable but disappointing for the lack of ocean acccess - but there is so much more nearby. And since no hotel is on the best beaches (except Mauna Kea and Hapuna), it serves as good a place as any and its proximity to the King's and Queen's markets lets you have a complete stay, ", " This resort is nothing short of unbelievable. The grand entrance, the monorail to take you to your room, the winding river with a boat to take you around town, the snorkeling lagoon, the lazy river pool....the list could go on and on. The rooms were a bit small, and the bathrooms even smaller, but that's the only negative I can say. Everything else was just amazing. You probably need a few days to cover every single aspect of the resort and there are so many interesting touches throughout that it seems like you're in a museum of sorts most of the time you're walking around. The staff is very helpful and full of the Aloha spirit. Truly a splurge worth every cent. ", " This was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. It has everything. There are several great restaurants, 2 pools with slides, a lagoon, dolphins, birds, spa, etc. The hotel is so big, you get a workout walking to your car. But if you don't feel up to a walk, there's a train or boat you can ride! ", " This hotel was wonderful! We purchased our trip from costco travel and it was totally worth it! our package included the \"aloha package\" wich included free breakfast for 2 every morning, free internet in the room, 2 free drinks everyday, free mini golf, discounted pool rentals, and much more. I want to go back! ", " The resort is beautiful, and the staff is the friendlylist I have encountered in my 12 trips in 2010. The resort is very clean, the rooms are bright and airy, and the restaurants were fantastic. You need to meet David, a waiter, at the Waterfront Restaurant, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and all without missing a beat with his good service. I will be back in a couple of months for a longer stay. ", " After spending two nights on the Hilo side, we transferred to the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Kona side of the island. This resort is HUGE, very spread out. While they have boats and a monorail that take you from point A to B, there is still potential to have to walk a lot. Not a deterrant by any means, just something to be aware of. It is a beautiful resort though. The pool and lagoon are massive. The lagoon lets in ocean water, and fish and other sea creatures, so you can swim and snorkel. You can also do various water activities...stand up paddle boarding, etc. They also have the dolphin complex, where you can pay to interact, or just walk by and watch. Down the street from the hotel are a bunch more food and shopping options. One thing to note, we stayed in the Ocean Tower. I paid to get an \"Ocean Front\" room. This hotel does not have ocean front rooms, as they are not directly on a beach. While we could see the ocean from our room, it wasn't as impactful as I imagined....I had pictured being able to look left and right and see the coastline on either side. Again, not a negative, just an expectation that wasn't fully realized. The room was very nice tho, but if I had to do over I might save and not go with the deluxe room (their equivalent to an ocean front). ", " We were at the Hilton Waikoloa for two weeks, and enjoyed every day/night we spent there. The staff was fabulous...considerate, welcoming, and more than accommodating at all times. We were upgraded to a suite in the Ocean Towers, and had a lovely view of the sea. The room was very very nice, spacious, clean and well kept. The grounds were amazingly well kept, and we enjoyed walking the paths each morning. With our room, we received complimentary internet access for the entire stay, $10 coupons to use in any of the restaurants on the resort and a small refrigerator. I have to say that I was worried after reading about the negatives of the resort, from noisy birds in the morning to smelly dirty rooms to unwelcoming staff. We did hear the mynah birds every morning and evening, but only when we walked out our door. Not once we were disturbed by their song. The room was clean, freshened daily and the bed was most comfortable. The staff really made an effort to meet our every need, and were always willing to go the extra mile. RE: the distance from the parking lot to the room, sure, it was a ways, but the walk was not long, 15 minutes or so, and not taxing at all. We learned to bring a rolling suitcase when we were going out for room snacks, water, etc. which made it easier to transport these items to the rooms. We preferred the boats to the tram, it seemed to take less time arriving at our stop and it was a nice ride through the resort, especially at night. The trams were often running slowly and, toward the end of our trip, full. There was an Herbalife convention during the second week of our stay which really filled up the trams. All in all, it was an excellent vacation, and I would readily recommend this resort to anyone. ", " We stayed at this hotel because my husband had a conference there. We loved the pools, but we would not have stayed here if we didn't need to because of the conference because I really wanted to explore other attractions on the island. We needed to allow an extra 1/2 hour just to get to the car. The service at the hotel was great and we loved the activities on the grounds.Here are some notes that I didn't see mentioned by the other reviewers:1. We could see fish in the protected lagoon both in shallow areas and deep areas. I got nervous letting my kids swim far from the beach because it seemed to get very deep fast.2. We enjoyed just watching the dolphins, which is free.3. The two large pools each has a waterslide for kids 42\" and over. They have someone watching the slide and the kids had to have a wristband to go on it. At the Ocean Tower pool there is a small waterslide that my preschooler could go on and I could watch my kids on the big waterslide at the same time. At the Kona pool on the other side of the complex, my preschooler loved the shallow play area with the sandy bottom, but my older kids wanted to go on the big waterslide on the other side of the pool. Fortunately, I had another adult to help me so one of us could stay with the older kids (you could sit and watch the bottom of the waterslide, which is good because they don't have lifeguard) and the other could watch the younger child.4. The buffet breakfast has the following: omelet bar, cereal, juice, smoothies, fruit, salad, scrambled eggs, a potato dish, french toast, yogurt, rice, a couple of other hot dishes, freshly baked goods (banana bread, croissants, cinnamon muffins) that changed each day, bagels and bread (not freshly made) with toaster and various toppings (peanut butter, cream cheese, jelly). I found an advanced purchase rate online which included two adult breakfasts included (it was a little bit more than the advance purchase rate w/o breakfast, and way cheaper than paying full price). Younger kids (possibly 4 and under) get breakfast for free. We did have a server, so we ended up also leaving a tip at the end of the meal. When we checked in, they gave me coupons for the breakfasts that were included with the room. So, if you have family of 4, you could use 4 coupons one morning and not eat the breakfast the next morning. The room had a refrigerator and we stopped at a grocery store in town before coming to the resort to take care of some of our meals. The restaurants were expensive! The Japanese restaurant had meals for $30 each, and the Chinese restaurant had meals for around $20. We ate at the Chinese restaurant one night. The food was good, but if we were to do it again, we would have made an advance reservation so we could sit outside.Note: I gave sleep quality only 3 stars because I didn't like the pillows, but I am very picky about pillows, ", " We loved the boat and train around the resort...the wait was not that long for the transport, or you could always just walk. The grounds were really clean, well groomed and had tons of nooks and crannies to explore around the pools and lagoon. The lagoon has sea turtles to snorkel with. Super cool place, we extended our stay. ", " When we arrived around 7:00pm after a long day of travel I was pleasantly suprised at the speedy check-in. We did choose to valet our car so we didn't have to traipse all of our luggage across the parking lot. We stayed in the Ocean tower and had a beautiful view. It was better than expected! Even though the resort was fairly full I never heard anyone at nighttime and slept wonderfully. The grounds are beautiful. The tram and boat system do tend to take some extra time so you need to be aware if you need to be somewhere at a set time. The walk from our room to the front desk was about 15 minutes, which was sometimes quicker than waiting for the tram/boat. The staff is really the highlight. They were wonderful and made our trip even better. One reminder, there is a gas station near the resort, but if you have an early flight fill up your rental car the night before. If you don't, they are not open until later in the morning and there is not another gas station anywhere near the airport. ", " As a Hilton Honor Diamond member I stay at Hilton properties for business every month. This was our vacation. I originally tried to book my reservation online and could not due to blocked rooms. I then reserved my 8 day vacation at the Marriott.A day after we arrived in Hawaii, I went over to the Hilton property and worked with Ranada at the front desk to see if there was any availability.Thanks to Ranada, she was able to secure us a room and have it prepared per my preferences the very next day for us to move in. She made this transition seamless . Ranada is your best asset. I cannot say I have even come close to receiving the personalized , professional and friendly service that this lady provided when staying at other Hilton properties. ", " My wife and I stayed at the Hilton for three nights during a nine night Hawaiian Honeymoon vacation. Right off the bat, First class all the way. Upgraded (free) to a full ocean view room in the ocean towers and the room was tremendous. Bottle of champagne waiting for us when we arrived. Grounds were quite beautiful along the golf course leading out the the ocean and found them to be very clean and well kept. Center area by the towers with the snack bar, fish pond and coffee shop were a nice treat and very close to the room. Also enjoyed the lagoon area. Very calm, lots of water activities and turtles galore. Very fun area to hang out on a hot day. Very nice pool as well. Staff (Duke at the welcome center) were very helpful and professional. Overall, probably the best hotel / resort stay I've had to date. Very much enjoyed it and our only regret, not staying there for the whole nine nights. Was beautiful and what I've grown to expect with Hilton Resorts. Thanks for a great time. ", " My partner and I live on the Big Island and thought it might be nice to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village as a nearby getaway. We were a little leery of staying at a major tourist resort with majojr tourist crowds, but we gave it a shot anyway.While we had been to the Hilton before, and had taken visiting friends there before on many occasions, we hadn't stayed there since we first moved here over 8 years ago. Simply put, we were wowed!Checking in was a breeze at the front desk. We hopped into the tram (looks like a monorail) that goes right through the lush, tropical property (they have boats that run back and forth too) and rode it to the Cascades Towers at the north end of the property. We entered our Suite 4099 and our jaws dropped. It was not only huge and well appointed with a spacious bathroom that had both a tub and a glass shower with marble floors and walls, but the living and bed rooms both opened up onto a long balcony that looked southward over most of the hotel grounds and the ocean. We looked down into the \"river\" used by the boats and saw a 3 foot barracuda swimming with yellow tangs and other tropical fish. Looking out our view was of coconut palms and other tropical plants, the rocky but calm ocean leading into the lagoon with people swimming, and the other Hilton Waikoloa Village buildings.We quickly put on our swimsuits and went down to the adults-only swimming pool, where we relaxed for hours in peace and quiet reading our books in the warm air and water. The river boats went by every 10 minutes or so and tropical birds on little islands called to each other from time to time.Changing for dinner, we met local friends in the lobby and showed them our room, with suitably honest oohs and aahs from them, Then we both road boats and walked to dinner at the Kamuela Provisioning Company, where we had ringside seats for the setting of the sun on the lanai just above the ocean beach.What a treat! We started with cocktails, including the Hawaiian Lava Flow. I don\u2019t know what was in it but it was like dessert with a little kick. We began dinner with the chef\u2019s amuse made from marinated shrimp, and pupus (starters) of a chilled ocean sampler consisting of shrimp, oysters, crab legs, poke (marinated fish) and a Maui fried onion ring tower. From that we launched into various dinners that included a prime rib eye, ginger steamed Monchong with coconut rice, Hawaiian sea salt fried organic chicken, and a combo surf & turf of lobster tail and beef tenderloin. Everything was differently delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by all. We were so full we couldn\u2019t order dessert. Maybe next time!We walked through the gardens and along the lagoon at night, walking up the enormous water entrance steps and pausing to admire the life-size oriental bronze horses and carriage, then over the bridge into the lobby where we bid our friends good night.Returning to our room, we stood on the balcony and looked at the subdued lighting and listened to the ocean expend its tiny waves against the coast. We crashed almost immediately on the Hilton king bed.Rising early we got on the river boat and rode over to the morning buffet at the Big Island Breakfast at the Water\u2019s Edge Ballroom, filling ourselves with custom omelets, a panoply of breads and fruits, and breakfast meats of all kinds. It was spacious, unhurried, and sat right against the lagoon where we watched pedal boats being readied for guests and early risers plonked down on the beach loungers. We thought it was buffet only but when we asked, our server handed us a-la-carte menus. We forgot the diets and dove into the buffet, which was delightful. And of course we ate too much.The rest of the morning was spent at the adult pool, followed by lunch at one of the river boats stops called Boat Landing. Though the menu was simple, it included sushi. We each had excellent burgers with potato chips; no fries are available at that location. We ended it by splitting an ice cream cookie sandwich. The waitress warned us it was hard because they keep it so cold, and we manage to bend our spoons a few times, but it was really delicious.We checked out about noon. The conversation all the way home in the car was about when we would go again.Because of our short time there and wanting to simply relax, we didn\u2019t snorkel in the lagoon or get a massage or swim with the dolphins or a million other things they have to do at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Next time\u2026 ", " We just got back from a great stay in Hawaii. The service was top notch, the staff very friendly and the hotel was what you would expect from a 5 star. The only negative was that the resort is so big once you leave your room you need a day bag because running back is a half hour trip. If you are with kids of any age skip the room with the ocean view(Ocean Tower) and request the Lagoon Tower. This keeps you in the most centralized location and by the best pool. Ladies have an ocean side massage, it is well worth the money! Restaurants are quite spendy but food was very good. ", " We got married on Oahu and then came to the Big Island for a honeymoon, which was actually in April 2008. I just wanted to say that this place was fabulous, we loved it. There is no ocean-side beach, but the Hilton Waikoloa has a huge lagoon for swimming, snorkeling and also a beach. The whole place is beautiful, many pools and wonderful grounds. Rooms were great. The breakfast buffet was so amazing , there were even little birds flying around. The complex has 4 main buildings which you can travel to by boat, by monorail or by foot. If you choose to walk you will be travelling through a corridor/museum. Service was great. We loved it and can recommend Waikoloa viilage to anyone, young or old. Luxurious, beautiful and peaceful. ", " The grounds of the Hilton Waikoloa Village are beautiful and provide for everything from a relaxing walk amid lush greenery to riding a boat from one side of the resort to the other. The pool is great and the dolphins and their trainers provide entertainment for those of all ages. Whales can be seen from the shore in season. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and most have wonderful views. We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. When we return to the Big Island, we will definitely stay here again! ", " I have lived in hawaii my entire life and I have stayed at various hawaii hotels on most all of the hawaiian islands, this one is by far my favorite. From the moment my family and i arrived at this hotel we were greated with excellent service and were even upgraded to a ocean view room that was right above the dolphin cove for no additional charge! The view from the guest room was unbelievable. The tram and boat service excellent. I believe that hilton waikoloa is the best resort in the state of hawaii, would definately stay again, ", " When we checked in at the Hilton Waikoloa Village the first surprise was: we were asked whether we would like to take the train or the boat to go from the reception to our room, but we were recommended to take the train due to the amount of luggage. It is true: the individual buildings of the hotel are connected with a futuristic train and with a Venice-like boat on a canal.Rooms were perfect and some of the restaurants were very good, e.g. the japanese restaurant. Unfortunately we made the experience that on some days not many restaurants were open after 20:00. So we had to go to some restaurants in the vicinity. ", " The hotel is beautiful! It may have a lot of rooms but it didn't feel crowded at all. It was so relaxing, we spent one afternoon just sleeping in the hammock by the ocean. The on-site restaurants are great too. ", " My husband and I have stayed at this beautiful resort several times dating back to the mid-90's. We used to dream of the day that we would have a family to share it with. When we were finally able to visit with our three children (ages 8-10) it was truly a dream vacation for each and every one of us. We have visited three islands (Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island) and several resorts throughout Hawaii. None have held a candle to the little slice of paradise we found at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, though many were substantially more expensive. The entire 62 acre resort (three separate hotel buildings, numerous pools, restaurants, shops, etc.) is breath-taking. Our favorite spot to stay is the Lagoon Tower with ocean view. What I love most about this resort is the expansive, all inclusive nature which allows you to park your car at the beginning of the stay and not return to it again until it's time to head to the airport! If you wish, you would never need to leave, look at a street or parking lot, fight crowds or traffic, etc. No matter how nice some of the other resorts we've tried -- not one has come close to the blissfully peaceful experience we always have at the Hilton Waikoloa Village (if you do choose to venture out, there is plenty to see close by, of course!). The size of the property as well as the way it is laid out allows you to truly enjoy the laid-back, relaxing and gorgeous atmosphere that beautiful Hawaii is famous for (and rightfully so - there's no place quite like it!). In all of our visits here, no matter the season, we have never once felt crowded, or had an unpleasant experience. The only unpleasant experience we had was when we checked out of this resort and moved on to the next island/resort and had to see the disappointment on our children's faces when they asked if we could go back to where we just came from! (Now we know to spend our entire Hawaii vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa Village - period!! We'll never stay anywhere else) I know each person/family is unique and my family's preferences may not mirror your own - but if you are looking for the ultimate in quiet, peaceful, relaxing Hawaii vacations I feel I can honestly say you will not find a better place than this. To my family - this is heaven on earth! ", " We just recently stayed here with our kids (7 and 10) and had a wonderful experience. We were upgraded to an ocean view room in the Lagoon tower. We loved this location. Not only did we have a fabulous view from our balcony, but we were close to the pools that our kids loved. Our room over looked the giant checkerboard so we sent them out often to play with that while we sat on our balcony. Since we had a hard time adjusting to the time zone, we would wake up very early, around sunrise, take a walk, and end up watching the dolphins wake up at the Lagoon tower - they seemed to be pretty active first thing in the morning. We ate most of our breakfasts at the Lagoon Spoon. Our kids loved being able to pick their cereals from the cereal wall and choose their toppings. We would then eat watching the dolphins.I noticed that some reviewers have complained about the size of the resort and how far it is from 1 end to the other, and we did not find this to be a problem for us. Our kids loved taking the boats or the tram. Sometimes we did have to wait a few minutes for it, but since we were on vacation, we were never in a rush to be anywhere. Sometimes we would just walk, and it still wasn't bad. Our kids actually like walking along the nice paths and bridges.I also noticed many complaining about the bird noise in the rooms. There was some bird noise early in the mornings before the sun came up, but it did not bother us. I am a light sleeper, and I hardly noticed it. We kept our sliding door shut with the a/c on at night, so maybe that is why. Our room was basically just a normal hotel room, although it did have a small couch in it, and I liked that it had a walk in closet to keep all of our luggage and clothing out of the way. We stocked up on snacks and drinks from the market that is in the Queens Shops. Our room had a small fridge and a shelving to put all of our food and drinks.As a side note, if you would like to go to a nice beach, we loved the Mauna Kea beach. It is about 10 minutes north of the Hilton. Get there early (before 10am) as they do limit the number of cars that get to park there. We loved this beach and went twice. The snorkeling was awesome there too.So, basically, we thought this resort was the perfect place for us. Our kids just loved everything there was to do here, and happy kids make for happy parents! ", " Having read other reviews i was sceptical about this Resort but it really is wonderful. There is a train and a boat service to get you around the resort (as it is some 62 acres in size) otherwise the walk is set out with either museum like artifacts or beautifully maintained gardens. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view which had great views over the golf course and buddha point, absolutely beautiful. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. The staff were always happy and greeted us with aloha whenever we passed. We ate and drank at the bars and restaurants, all were very good, a little expensive but you expect that. The restuarant KPC is a must, great food and amazing views! The Resort is within walking distance of shops and more restuarants or there is a shuttle which costs $1 per person each way. All in all a great resort for relaxing ", " This is a wonderful hotel, immaculately maintained and staffed by friendly, competent personnel. The hotel is very large, consisting of three separate \"towers.\" The Lagoon tower sits above the hotel's private lagoon and looks to be a great place for kids (we're empty-nesters). The Ocean Tower, our favorite, commands spectacular ocean views with crashing waves and glorious sunsets (when the clouds over the ocean don't get in the way). The Palace tower seems the least desirable, set back from the ocean in the center of the resort. The place is huge and you never have to leave it, if that's your thing. The only drawbacks are no beach (the lagoon has a sandy shore) and the hotel's large size - it can take 15 minutes to get from your room to your car. We love it! ", " Big Island Breakfast is a \"must do\". Be sure to ask to have David as your server. He is a not only a wonderful server (remembering your orders from morning to morning) but an island native who can recommend the sites while entertaining you with island history & stories.One morning I even over-heard him talking to some of the Japanese guests in their native language!The marine biologists who work with the dolphins are also very friendly & informative. I spent nearly 30 minutes talking to a young man (who's name I unfortunately didn't get) about the dolphins before signing up to swim with them.Andrew, one of the \"boat captains\" was also a lot of fun. He would sing a song of all the stores & sites at each of the stops. One morning a small child threw their shoe over-board. The captain backed the boat up & used her umbrella to fish the shoe out--unfortunately I didn't get her name either.This was a \"vacation of a life-time\" with memories of beautiful sites & unforgettable personalities. ", " We had 9 days here and it was not enough. Great property. We enjoyed the hammocks, the pools, the cocktails and the view of the ocean from our room. Do the valet parking. It is only $6 more a day and so convenient! We enjoyed the boat transportation across the property, althought later in the evening er had to wait a bit for the next boat. During the day the train takes too long since it waits a few minutes at each stop. Of course, a walk is always good too and there are many routes one can take by the shore or the museum walk. We already made a downpayment toward our next stay since they were running a special. Can't wait to go back! ", " We stay here every year for the past decade. Still love this place. You can spend several days just on the property with all the pools, art work, tours, luau, dining and shops. Great for kids especially if they can swim. The hotel now offer a free movie, Wednesday nights pool side or lounge in the pool. The Steakhouse still has great food. Requested outdoor seating to watch the sunset and they did not disappoint. Ate at the Queens Shops and off site the other nights. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. We'll be back next year. Might use the Menehune Day Camp next time. ", " With the increase rates of inter-island plane tickets my family and I have no choice but to enjoy a STAY-CATION on the Big Island. We live in Waimea (north of the hotel) where it's cold and windy. My kids love to go to the Hilton where they feel safe to run around the property enjoying all the amenities. The staff is always so nice and attentive to our kids. The camp for kids is great, a little pricy, but great. My five year old was raving about the acitivities that the kids do at camp. My husband and I ate at KPC and Imari, it was wonderful! The candy wall at the poolside restaurant is a hit with the kids. Everyone we encountered were so friendly to us locals, far cry from some other hotels we stayed at where the staff is only nice to the tourists. It was on a Saturday night after having dinner at KPC, my husband and I were taking a stroll back to our room in ocean tower when we came across this free entertainment by the wedding house. We sat there for the ending part and agreed that this was a remarkable thing that the Hilton has. Something actually free that don't require money for both locals and tourists to enjoy. The girl there said it happens once a month, free music, free storytelling, free lei making. It's worth seeing because it had a homely feel to it. Had I known it was there every month I would bring my families down to see it all the time. Now I know I will return on the same weekend. Anyhow Hilton is still the best in my eyes. And my kids LOVE IT! ", " My wife and I have compared some of the other resorts here on the Big Island to the Hilton Waikoloa. Hands down the Hilton is far superior. In fact it is far superior to any resort we have been to anywhere in the world. We plan to return as many times as we can. ", " Living in Alaska, we travel to Hawaii every time we can during the winter. This is absolutely our favorite place to stay. It's beautiful...romantic, especially at night with the torches and hammocks, and feels like it's own little world. The restaurants are fantastic, we really never have to go anywhere else to eat, and we could stay in their pool all day (and we have!) It's absolutely huge and is near some shopping, which comes in handy. The only draw back is the distance from some of the exploring (volcanos, towns, etc.) but at the same time, that was nice because you were away from the crowds. Where I come from, we can't drive long distances so having to drive is a treat for us. The staff is fantastic and their spa is perfect, especially after a day of hiking around a volcano. :) ", " This is a beautiful hotel which hosts the fabulous Taste of the Hawaiian Range event. King and Queen shops are nearby and there are so many things to do on-site. However, if you stay in the Ocean Tower near the Palm Terrace area, bring ear plugs. Those crazy birds kept me up all night. I think the Hilton needs to seriously rethink their landscaping in this area. ", " This resort is great for small kids. I have 2 kids (1 and 3), they both loved it! Pools are great, lagoon was great, my 3 year old snorkeled no problem! Safe and enclosed, a little murky, but saw lots of fish and a turtle. My 3 year old also LOVED the water slides (note you have to be 42 inches to go on them, we had to do some convincing to get the wrist band, sine he is a couple inches short), but he LOVED them, going up and dow for hours. This resort is VERY SAFE and CLEAN for small kids.I just want to comment on some of the negative posts. We stayed in the ocean tower, with the garden/golf course view. Had NO problems with birds. Didn't even notice or hear them till we walked out to the center of the tower. So it really depends on where your room is located.Also, this hotel is located on the BIG ISLAND. Do some research before you go, if you want sandy beaches, Waikaloa is not the place. Also, if you want night life, you need to go to the larger towns. I personally LOVE this area. Rocky coast line, but some of the BEST scuba diving, snorkeling and fishing in Hawaii. My son saw a sea turtle every time he snorkeled, plus one sun bathing on the rocks. We love the lava fields and vast open space. Also, the weather tends to be always nice in this location, sunny (little rain in this area) and warm. We are looking forward to planning another trip. ", " We've just returned from a 6-night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village - it was everything I could have ever hoped for! The grounds were absolutely breathtaking - I don't know the exact size, but it was over 20 acres of manicured grounds, multiple swimming pools and a large lagoon with water pumped directly from the ocean - and you can snorkle right there. We saw all kinds of fish and sea turtles without even leaving the grounds. Our room was beautiful - it had a walk-in closet, and large vanity sink area and nice lanai overlooking the ocean and the lagoon area. We purchased a package which included a huge buffet breakfast every morning (called the Big Island Breakfast) which was very good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our small children (ages 2 and 5) loved the lagoon area, which features a sandy beach - our 2-year-old had a blast playing in the sand with a bucket and shovel. Since the hotel is so large, there is a transportation system in place - much like a Disney Park - which consisted of a monorail-type train and boats. This is very helpful if you don't like to walk, or, like us, have small children who get tired out quickly.My one negative comment would be that this resort is pretty far (30 ish miles) from the next towns which have medical services and dining options, since the restaurants at the resort can be a bit pricey. My comment would be do a shopping trip in one of the larger towns for any drugstore-type items you may need - otherwise you'll be paying $8 for a small bottle of Pepto-Bismol on-site.Overall though, I loved this place and would defnintely go back again. ", " We stayed in Hilo side for couple of nights and came to Hilton for another few nights. We did lots of sightseeing in Hilo side so we came to hotel to relax and that's what we got. At first, I made reservation to other hotel in Kona area but we switched to this one b/c it had kids club. We loved what Hilton have to offer, pool, lagoon and waterslide for kids. After couple of non-stop sightseeing, we were able to relax by the waterfall while kids just go crazy on waterslide. Lagoon was good. We did kayaking and little bit of snorkeling. I admit this is not a place for young adults because it had no night life and the location is about 20 miles from next town on either direction. If you are looking for a nite life, you are better off staying in Kona area. We didn't buy breakfast package so we ate at Hawaiian Style Cafe in Kamuela which is about 20 minutes away but it is worth the drive. Food is cheap and delicious. We didn't use any of restaurants in the hotel because they were way overpriced so we dined out in nearby shopping area. We tried to eat where local people eat and they were all good. Rooms were good except it smelled bad whenever we turned AC on so we left the window open during nite time. We stayed at Lagoon tower so we didn't have bird problem ( I actually called the hotel before our arrival and asked which tower was the best for kids). Didn't really use much of tram and boat because Lagoon tower was closer to lobby so you can walk in 2 minutes. However I never understood why ground level was not connected on one end of the building because we had to either go all the way around or take stairs to go upstairs to take elevator back down to ground level on the other side. It must've been a design error. My kids did Dolphin Quest which I thought it was a rip off ($210 per kids for 1 1/2 hour and actual interaction with dolphins is about 20-30 minutes) but my kids rated 10 plus. Oh, beach next to hotel is not for swimming however a 10 minute drive to Hapuna Beach or Spencer Beach was really nice. Both beaches were just beautiful and our kids just had blasts in both beaches. Spencer beach has much gentler waves for younger kids. Before you come, definitely do some research. I think this is a great hotel for family with kids but not for young adults who wants good nite life. ", " We were married there (on property/on the lawn next to the wedding chapel) two years ago at sunset (seemed like a dream wedding; very memorable) and we would highly recommend staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. We just got back and love the property and the Big Island. The property is beautiful and really enjoyed walking the grounds everyday, starting at the peaceful Buddha Point. One of the most exciting mornings we had was when we spotted a Hawaiian Monk Seal (which is almost extinct; only 1,100 left in the world). He swam into the lagoon (everyone had to get out of the lagoon because these seals are protected and you can't get within around 50 feet of them) and swam around for quite awhile. Heard the last time he was there was two years ago. It was my dream to see a monk seal. Also, was a dream to swim with the Hawaiian green sea turtles (honu) and we were able to do that in the lagoon (also saw a eel in the lagoon which was really exciting too). At the same time the seal excitement was happening, on the other side of the lagoon, was the feeding of the baby dolphin. It's really cute and was neat to see it later swim with its mother. We totally enjoyed our stay at the property. In fact we only left the property one day [went around the whole island one day stopping at Manago hotel, Kona chips store, green sand beach, black sand beach, Punaluu bakery, Volcano park, Hilo - Big Island candies, Kuhio Grill (for ono hawaiian food; lau lau and best fried rice we ever had), and saw lava flow at sunset near Kalapana gardens, etc.]. The rest of our trip we relaxed and stayed on the property - lying in a cabana drinking lava flows and mai tais, snorkeling/swimming with the Hawaiian green sea turtles, sliding down the slides in the great pools located throughout the property, eating on property (a great find was the Kamuela Provision restaurant - had a fabulous/ono meal there with an patio ocean view. Our waiter, Warren, was excellent (ask for him if you go). Great customer services were provided by him and he went totally out of his way to make you feel at home and happy with your meal. We did not want to leave the property, in fact we paid extra to have a very late check out time. We do want to go back soon. ", " We live on Oahu and hopped over for the weekend, using a local resident rate. (CALL the hotel for the kama'aina rate if you are a Hawaii resident.) Chose this hotel because we'd heard about the pools and the boat/tram system for getting around. The kids were in heaven. The pools are amazing, rooms very large and comfortable. The resort was almost at capacity, but we never felt crowded, as the place is huge. Friendly staff, sometimes hard to find though, and they adjusted an incorrect upgrade charge immediately when I brought it to their attention. We bought breakfast foods from the local grocery store and ate dinner off property to save some bucks. We knew everything on property would be very expensive (and it was), so planned accordingly. Highly recommend this property! ", " I only read the Tripadvisor reviews after I had already booked this hotel and almost did not go there and lost money spent. But we did go there ... and LOVED it.My husband and I (30s, no kids) staid at this Hotel mid August for one day before heading over to Volcano Park. We had a great, very clean room in the Ocean Tower. It is true that you take a train to your room, but they come often and are rather fast. At night, taking the boat was really fun. During the day, we usually walked to the pool and the other side of the hotel. It takes around 5 min from the Ocean Tower to walk to the pool with the waterslides, another 5 min to walk to the Ocean pool on the other side (slow walking, husband had hurt leg). The whole resort was so clean and everyone was so friendly. All workers greet you whenever they see you. There are so many different pools - one with slides, an ocean pool with a sandy beach (including live turtles, fish - lagoon), a whirlpool area. I went sea-kayaking in the lagoon and my husband tried the big board with the paddle. I really wished we would have had more time. The dolphins are great to watch! It is highly recommended to book that experience in advance as slots are sold out (we could not get in :-( ). Watching the dolphins is free, you have to pay to swim with them. There was a little 1-week baby dolphin when we were there! There are nice beach chairs all along the coast, the pools, etc. If you want solitude, look for a chair away from the slide pool which is a very popular area for kids.Our room was very quiet. However, we were woken up at 6am by a flock of birds that decided to play in the courtyard in front of your room and was unbelievably noisy. They moved on shortly after waking us up. But that could have happened anywhere.Lastly, the food. After we landed, we drove to Kona as I had read about all the negative food comments. I would highly recommend to try the hotel food offering; the menus looked delicious and the prices reasonable (everything is relative: it is more expensive than Chilis, but it is not Chilis!). Restaurants have different price points starting $5-10 going up to $30-50 for main dishes. Note that there are many Japanese tourists and that there are two Japanese restaurants on the premise. The sushi bar (I had a late night snack there just before they closed) is around $10 for 5 pieces of sushi, $6 for a roll. Very good and very authentic (using real sushi rice, where rice kernels are not broken or damaged). The other one is a Japanese steak house which we did not eat at but watched many happy Japanese tourists exiting. Do not go there if you like American sushi; this is the real, authentic experience you are signing up for. If you want even cheaper, go to the Waikola mall (5 min drive max); there is a store called Island Gourmet. It is a supermarket style place that sells (again) sushi, chicken dishes, soups, fruit, drinks, salads, pasta, and much more.It is also not that far away from Kona for a day trip. Again, everything is relative. We will be back! ", " We stayed here in May for 4 nights and so wished we were staying for longer. The pool, the hotel, the room, the luau, the dolphins, the cocktails and everything else (too many to mention) were absolutely amazing, we could actually see the sea whilst lying in bed and the views we had from our balcony of the sunset over the Lagoon Pool / Sea were so gorgeous, we couldn't stop taking pictures. Some things were a little bit pricey, i.e. the parking and the chinese restaurant on site (the only restaurant we actually ate at, at the hotel) added it's own gratuity onto the bill which was quite a bit more than we would have given if we had our choice but I know that's not unheard of and we did expect things to be quite expensive. The hotel is big but we liked that being a couple as we could go for walks in the evening and hardly see anyone and it felt very romantic, we will definately be going back next year. ", " We just got back from the Big Island. The Hilton was great! It is located in an upscale area with other very nice resorts and condominiums. Everything is green and lush and nicely landscaped. The hotel has three main living areas which are connected by a covered \"museum walk.\" The walk itself is long but very doable. For those who don't care to walk, there is a sleek tram and a water taxi. The tram stations have monitors which tell you how long the wait will be before the next tram or boat arrives. Our building (Palace Tower) didn't have anything except a gift shop, so we were always going to another area for food or swimming or laundry. The museum walk was extraordinary - fully stocked with art objects from around the world (mainly Pacific Rim). Very beautiful and unique.Down the street, near the hotel, are a couple of shopping centers which offer dining alternatives. It is a short drive from the Hilton, and one night we walked to it just for fun.The pools are great. There is a neat little kiddie pool which has a zero entry and a sand bottom. At another pool, there is a suspension bridge which is fun to cross. We were there on a day when they strung a screen across two palm trees and showed a poolside movie. The kids loved it.The only downside is the sheer size of the place. We would park our car in the spacious parking lot after a full day of sightseeing, only to face the prospect of either a long-ish walk to our room or a long-ish wait for the next tram. I was never really bothered by that, but that was a big negative for my wife. Perhaps we would have had a different perspective if we stayed at the Lagoon Tower, which has food establishments and all the pools. ", " I read the reviews before going, but nothing prepared us for the the best vacation ever! The hotel was exceptionally beautiful. The lagoon was heaven, I could have spent all day everyday watching the turtles swim by me. The fish were awesome. In a word this hotle was AMAZING. yes, it is big, and yes be prepared to walk a lot, but it's good exercise anyway. We stayed at the Hilton on Oahu last year and were concerned about not having beach access. NOT a problem. We did not miss it at all. There are beaches very close, but none of the 6 of us missed it. The pool area is HUGE and not overly crowded. The jacuzzis are great too.Trip tips: valet for sure, you can call down a head of time and they will have your car waiting for you. The self park is too far.Purchase the food card. Lagoon spoon sells them. If you planning to use the internet and drink...get the aloha pass as well. Get the 5 day lagoon rental for $250.00. You have access to all equipment for 5 days includes kayaks, paddle board, boats, snorkle stuff...The food was not overly priced as others may have stated. If you live in any major city you will understand. Eat off the property at Buzz's steakhouse. Mud pie to die for! We are planning to return next year...counting down the days. Have a great time...Aloha! ", " The resort complex was almost like Disneyand traversed via real motor boat and electric train as vacationers go through the all-around amenities that Hilton is known for. Daily room service was very good and communication throughout the resort was efficient via polite telephone operators. The Breakfast Buffet was excellent. Hospitality attendants were polite and very responsive. One particular attendant named Romulo, was very cordial and hospitable. He is an asset to the resort. Food was piping hot and very good. Menu was varied each day. Breakfast was something to look forward to.I recommend this vacation spot to anyone if the big island is under consideration. ", " What a great location...take the kids, take the in laws, there is so much to do, and plenty of room so you won't get in each other's way! ", " We booked our trip through Costco, which I found to be the best price. We got a direct flight from LAX, it included daily breakfast buffet for 2, 2 cocktails a day, we enjoyed the \"Lava Flow\" they were delicious! Perfect drink on vacation! Strawberry, coconut, white rum all blended like a slushy. It also included our rental car. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, and had a view of the lagoon and a little of! the dolphins, but every time you walk out of our hotel and walk just out to the bridge you could watch the dolphins. They are such beautiful creatures! You could sit at the Lagoon Grill and watch them and just enjoy their beauty and that of the ocean. Our room was one of the few that was renovated, so it was very contemporary, with a huge walk in shower, double sinks a really comfortable king bed and the pull out sofa felt like a tempurpedic! It was so nice. We looked at getting another room after the first night because our room was on the end by one of the doors and the elevators, and you could hear people at night when we were asleep. We are light sleepers though. After looking at one of the other rooms and they were older, although we would have had a better view, we chose to stay in ours. It was new and much more comfortable. My brother stayed in one of the regular rooms that hadnt been updated and his 10 year old couldn't sleep on the sofa bed, because it was horribly uncomfortable. We had delicious buffet breakfast at the Water's Edge, which was included for us, we only had to pay for our 2 girls. There is so much to do at this resort, we only snorkeled in the lagoon 1 day, and used the pools 2 or 3 days out of our 7 day stay. The lagoon pool is a bit cooler probably because it is so big, but when you are sitting out in the heat for a while you want to jump in and cool off. The slides are a lot of fun! You really need to stay for 10 days just so you could fully enjoy the resort, you really don't have to leave. But we did a snorkel cruise 1 day (Body Glove), Dolphin Quest 1 day and a Lua while we were there. We visited Hapuna Beach which was about 6 miles north of the hotel and was absolutely beautiful, soft sand, gorgeous water, no coral, lots of sea turtles swimming past you. We snorkeled at A'Bay right in front of the Marriott, and there are so many sea turtles, they swim right next to you, 1 was hitting my 5 year old with it's fin as it swam by. The only thing about this location was that there is a ton of coral and it is very dangerous. I cut myself twice, trying to snorkel with my 5 year old. The Hilton was great, great for families, and because it is so big it never felt crowded and the service was great! Hope we could go again in a few years but for longer! ", " A \"perfect place\", even a little too perfect. Yes, it can accommodate thousands of people, yes, a little Disneyland feeling, huge distances to cover, but still nice and fun. So please look at the whole picture and not everything with a magnifying gals and then you should have a really great time. There were several high points for us and no real low point:We got one of the less fancy rooms looking on the golf course as opposed to the sea. I think it was more quiet and we liked it that way. After-all how much time do you want to spend in your room? Otherwise the rooms were comfortable and spacious, but you did have a little 80's feeling looking at the bathroom, door knobs etc.The dolphins that are kept there are a lot of fun. You can go into their pool and they take photos of you. These dolphins behaved like house pets, they periodically came over, showed us some tricks, wanted to attract our attention. You decide: are you sorry for the poor dolphins in captivity, or happy for them that they can live twice as long as in the sea, no stress, good food, getting massages, etc.The landscape is very well kept so you don't feel like in an entertainment factory, unlike in some other resorts.A word of advice: the Big Island is really big, so if you only stay in the Hilton Waikaloa, you will put hundreds of miles in your car each day. We staid a few days there and a few days in Volcano Village the other side of the island (Volcano Village Lodge - a fantastic, romantic place, unlike the Hilton Waikaloa) ", " We traveled to the Big Island with our two daughters - ages 8 and 10 for 6 nights. 4 of those nights were spent at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. It was WONDERFUL! The first 3 nights we were in a partial oceanview room in the Lagoon Tower. We had a king bed with the pullout sofa and then requested a rollaway. It worked great for the four of us. The pools were wonderful - we spent most of our time at the Lagoon Tower pool and it was not crowded at all. My girls loved the big water slide. We walked everywhere, and from the lagoon tower it was a couple of minutes walk to get to the main lobby. One night we walked along the ocean all the way to Buddha point for sunset, and that was also a very pleasant walk and not long at all. We did take the boat back for fun and the girls enjoyed that. We took the advice of some on tripadvisor and valet parked our car. It was definitely worth the extra dollars for them to bring the car to us - with AC running and the \"hot car feeling\" already gone. We never had any problems with housekeeping or the front desk. I used the concierge a few times and they were also great. I was able to print boarding passes and check us in online for our flight home in the business center at no charge. We ate at Lagoon Spoon one morning and it was definitely not worth the money. We ate at the Big Island Breakfast buffet on our last morning, and I am very glad that we didn't find it earlier. It was wonderful and the food and service were fantastic, but it was very expensive. We left the Hilton for two nights to stay on the Volcano side of the island and returned for one night before flying home. On our return night we were upgraded to a suite in the Lagoon Tower. It was beautiful and we felt like we were living in the lifestyles of the rich and famous. It was a pleasant surprise and a great way to end our Hawaiian adventure. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It was great for our family, and for a week in early July - it did not feel crowded. We were there for the Fourth of July and they had a fun poolside BBQ dinner and then we watched the fireworks from Queen's Marketplace on the front lawn of the Hilton. A Great Week and I highly recommend it!! ", " This hotel and experience exceeded our expectations. The level of customer services from all hotel staff members was fantastic. Lots of great family activities: Dolphins, snorkel lagoon, many pools, water slides etc etc.Highly recommend, especially for families.David. ", " We stayed with Hhonors points for 8 nights, Total hotel bill (including lagoon rentals) was $261.00 for the 8 day stay. Also used SkyMiles for flights. Must go first class.Airport - very small but cool - all open air. Very fast security and boarding. One hour arrival prior to departure flight time will be fine.Rental Cars - must now take vans for 2 minute drive. Several rental car company options - 4WD Jeeps very roomy at Avis. Could come in very handy for mountain or rain forest. Also Dodge Caravans for families available at a reasonable price. Do not rent if planning to stay on property entire week.Hilton Waikoloa Hotel (turn left from Airport onto Queen Highway then 25 minutes North to first traffic light, then left onto Waikoloa Beach Road. Go through several stop signs (watch out for pedestrians) then turn left into hotel. Immediate left for lobby check-in.Hotel Parking:Valet or Self.Valet - leave at lobby entrance. Self - Must get parking ticket first time in, then use room keys for entry and exit. They will normally allow a short park at the lobby turn around for check-in if someone stays in the car whoo can move it if needed, Hotel Itself:Our 4th visit in 10 years - always awesome.- voted #1 for family vacations several years in a row by Travel Channel. I truly believe it. Palace Tower - no way. Lagoon Tower - also good for views and pools. Our room was on 8th floor Ocean Tower - great view of ocean and Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea hazy most days. Request Ocean Tower - Buddha Point. Visit Buddha Point at sunset for pictures. Check-in:Very fast - especially for Hhonors members or on week days.Three options to room:Walk, tram, or boat. Tram best for luggage. Use a handicapped car if not in use - more space for bags.Artwork in lobby and walkways is very awesome - worth the walk to the Ocean Tower and great for photo shoots of family or art pieces only. Also good exercise if not in a hurry - walk to the Ocean Tower can take 15 to 20 minutes brisk. One diagram on walkway to Ocean Tower shows the hotel being built - was not originally a Hilton property.Room - be green and decline service with do not disturb - Housekeeping will provide clean towels and other supplies promptly when requested.All pools are awesome as always including water slides, but very little shade in the Ocean Tower pools unless you pay to reserve a canopy - not sure of the cost. Lagoon pool has multiple pools, lots of shade,and several spas - also the best water slide.Lagoon swimming - lots of activities and turtles, fish, eels, and rays. Covered chaise lounges scarce -must claim one prior to 8:00am - only about 10 total are available - first come first serve. Normally regular chairs in ample supply. Good swimming after 3:00pm.Boat Channel - interesting to watch fish. Several barracuda including \"Elvis\" Also milk fish that look like sharks. Boat ride - more interesting than tram.Dolphin Quest - very expensive, especially pictures (they block you from taking your own shots then try to charge $150 for all digital pics. Good experience but it will cost you. Most of the time for young children is not spent with the dolphins, but in a training class.Ocean swimming behind Lagoon or beside Ocean Tower waterslide - hotel does not recommend but adults should may easily navigate - but definitely wear enclosed shoes - Lava will tear up your feet - very jagged!!!GOOD DEAL - rent a photographer at the front desk for $200 for one hour including clothes changes - includes all digital pictures on CD.Luau - do not bother, not authentic and $100 per person. Better Luaus at other hotels, and other locations. On-site restaurants - good but pricey. Might want to try one, but good options in Kona, Waimea, or at King and Queen shops near hotel.Off Site recommendations:Restaurants:HILTON CONCEIRGES WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND ON-SITE RESTAURANTS but they have menus for many off-site restaurants.MUST EAT - Merriman's (original) in Waimea - we eat there every trip - 45 minutes north but well worth the beautiful drive up to 2,500 feet above sea level. Huggo's in Kona - directly on the water, Poncho's and Lefty's - good inexpensive Mexican in Kona - good for a relaxing last night. Denny's beside Wal-Mart - good cheap breakfast. General Shopping:All big 3 present, Target, Wal-Mart, and K-Mart for cereal, milk, drinks, etc. Hilo Hattie's in Kona has the best souvenirs - also ABC stores on the strip in Kona. Crazy Shirts - a must visit for hats and shirts. Grocery Shopping:Big 3 in Kona, Island Gourmet - great food store in Queen Shops. Also in Kona - Safeway just above Wal-Mart beside Denny's.Side trips:Reservation in advance for the Japanese National (Subaru) telescope on Mauna Kea - need 4 wheel drive and all visitors 16 yr old, trip will take 3 hours each way and last only 30 minutes. Below freezing on the mountain.Hilo - waterfalls and flora but otherwise mostly a bore. Long round trip drive - but ok if bored on the hotel property.Fun to check out other hotels near the Hilton.An awesome state park and beach directly across from West Hawaii Veteran's Cemetery between airport and Waikoloa (bhis entrance not marked but paved unlike the other (marked) entrance is a very rough ride for 20 minutes at 5 miles per hour - could tear up a non 4WD. Excellent snorkeling everywhere. Rain forest trips good, See Waipio Valley info below.Helicopter flights $400 per person - very expensive unless you have a trust fund. Take a drive up the mountain residential area beside Kona - very scenic until the clouds and rain hit. Hawi - north tip very rustic and friendly - big waves for surfers.Volcano National Park - unless you are childless, very bored, or willing to walk 5 miles to actual lava over very rough rocks - do not bother. Kona - NCCL cruise ship on Wednesday - very crowded, otherwise fine except parking scarce. Pay lot just past Lefty's. Free lot take left just before Poncho's & Lefty's.Other Hawaii Activities & Information1) Blue Sea Cruises\u2014Double deck 70 foot catamaran Spirit of Kona, 2 glass ports to view under water. 2 hours, 15 minutes.

The place is still awesome, but a little crowded compared to other big island resorts. Lots of activities for the kids - swimming in the lagoon with fishes, dolphins, great pools, stargazing, luaus, etc. Restaurants are all quite good but pricey...would recommend driving or walking to nearby Kings or Queens shopping complex for excellent food. The grounds are breathtaking...great for early morning or after dinner stroll. Will definitely be back in a couple of years again. Only down side is that you will get nickled-and-dimed, ie fee for self-parking, internet access, connecting room, etc. ", " After reading reviews that included Disney references, myna birds squalking and long tram/boat rides I found our six night stay at HWV to be a really nice experience. I am a Hilton Honors Gold VIP and cashed in points for a six night stay. Rewards stays are limited to standard rooms but I was given an ocean front room in the Ocean Tower - albeit on the first floor (my preferences include high floors). The room was large and very nice and although you go downstairs to get from the tram/boat/pool to the first floor - giving you the feeling of being in the basement in the hallway - the room had it's charms. Instead of a lanai (balcony) we had a small patio with a view of the ocean, golf course and Maui on clear days which we enjoyed. My tip would go for rooms ending in 064-074 which are closest to the ocean if possible. We also received 2 - $10 vouchers good for food and beverage for each day there since they don't have a complimentary breakfast for VIPs. I used one a day for bagels/muffins at the stand near the Ocean Tower end of the tram (they are $4.95 each) and others towards drinks and meals (limited to one per person at a time). I self-parked the car - the walk isn't bad from the parking lot. The boat ride from the lobby to the ocean tower is pleasant, the train is painfully slow (if you miss it you can often walk to the next stop and catch up) and the walk is nice and there is a lot of artwork to admire. We bought some provisions at the general store in Kings Center which was not too painfully overpriced except for milk at $8.49/half gallon (I would just take a small cup at the coffee stand for breakfast and make tea in the coffee maker in the room). I wasn't crazy about the pools but we were there to go to beaches and sightsee anyway. The location is good and was for the most part out of VOG range which was pretty heavy that week. We liked the lobby lounge for a couple of light meals and drinks, the Japanese restaurant was ok but nothing I would highly recommend. Overall I liked the location which is fairly close to some nice beaches. Not too much outside of the hotel in terms of restaurants and nightlife - a few decent restaurants in the shopping village just outside the resort. ", " Loved this Place! Disneyland of the Big Island. Huge. Takes a day or two to lean the lay of it all. Disneyland style jungle boats were our favorite mode of transportation. Not only charming but a practical way to get around. A tram is also available. The setting is incredibly lush with greenery. Numerous pools of various sizes intermingled throughout the property, some with waterslides \u2013 very fun \u2013 some with cave-like settings, waterfalls, sandy bottoms, etc. Many chairs and cabanas available. An ocean-fed man-made lagoon onsite complete with waterfall, tropical fish, sports rental shack and what we considered the stars of the show, nine or ten large sea turtles. We did the snorkel thing and swam with them. Cool guys! Also tried our hand at paddle-boarding. Did all right for a couple of geriatrics : ) Great place to learn given the serenity of the lagoon.The hotel is situated within walking distance of \u201cA\u201d beach but we elected to visit Hapuna Beach State Park, approximately 6 miles from Hilton. Beautiful. Get there early. If you want to save a bit of money shopping is available within a mile of hotel \u2013 some good restaurants, general stores, etc there. For a buck they\u2019ll shuttle you there. We sat on the balcony of one of the on-site restaurants surrounded by tiki torches and watched a mesmerizing red sun dip into the sea. Beautiful. We did request a room change after second day \u2013 wanted that full ocean view \u2013 and they were kind enough to accommodate us. Occupancy was down in May so we made out there. I could go on and on but give this place a try. We\u2019re already talking about next year\u2019s trip! MB ", " Currently staying at the HWV and we LOVE This Place. Second year in row. I am Hilton Diamond member & have traveled all over the world staying at Hiltons.This place by far is so special. We have a 3 1/2 year old and have stayed in the Lagoon Tower both years. After reading the latest review from \"glad our room was comped\". I had to write a review.If you do not like kids or have kids why come here.... Free or not go to another island. Also if you do not want to excercise or walk stay at another hotel. This place is so big and has so many choices. How can you not be happy with choices.Where in the world can you watch dolphins play & jump all day long long.Bottom line if you are looking for a family friendly unique resort with beatiful large grounds the HWV is for you... We will be back again and again ", " Wowow... I can't tell you how wonderful our stay was at the HWV. We stayed at the ocean tower facing west... our room is straight out overlooking buddha point! Amazing Sunset... WOW... from the moment we check in... service was great.. we are HHONORS... so, we don't have to wait... and they took our bags and ship it to our rooms immediately. We hopped on the boat to our room.. Amazing fish in the canal. Really nice...The room was lovely... LOVE THE SHAMPOOS, CONDITIONERS, and THE LOTIONS!!! Amazing room with beautiful view... when you get the room and you want the sunset view.. make sure you are facing west.. in the ocean tower... the 71 is the best for viewing it is dead center looking at the sun.... amazing...Oh.. we have the inclusive exclusive package.. which is great.. we don't have to hunt down food anywhere... we can eat basically everything and everywhere on property ...LOVED it!!! totally worth it.... they didn't nickel and dime out.... in the end... we think we all gain like 8 lbs.. after 3 days of 3 meals a day!!!Oh yes... go to swim with the dolphins!!! amazing program!!! a bit pricey.. but worth it!!!Do go to the lagoon to swim in the morning... it gets very unclear water and can't see anything in the afternoon when high tides come in.... YOU WILL SEE about 5 sea turtles always hanging out by the water fall....Totally would recommend this to others!!! Keep in mind, you are on vacation!!! Don't run... wait for the train or boat... it is slow ... but it is cool!!!! YOU ARE IN HAWAII ON VACATION!!!! Relax and chill!!!! IT IS AN AMAZING PROPERTY!!!! ", " Recently came back from vacation from this hotel\"resort\" in April 2010. The hotel is massive. Grounds well kept, and spotless. Many choices of pools, \"man made\" beach, and tons of activities to do. Rooms are your typical rooms, beds were very comfortable, and plenty of amenities in the marble baths. Room safe,mini bar, safes, robes, slippers, etc..... Check in was easy, check out easy. About a 20 minute drive from KOA. Restaurants on resort campus were very nice. Pool food and drinks had a nice assortment, or you could bring your own water, soda, beer without any problems. To get to one end of the hotel to other you have 3 choices. 1) walk...best option2) water taxi 3) tram. You can actually walk faster through the resort than the tram. Nice to ride if really tired, but slow. Water taxi thru the lagoon is nice, romantic and faster than the tram. To me, walking got you to point A to point B fastest, and even though the resort is massive, you can easily walk from end to end in 15 minutes. The restaurant on the very end of the resort called KPC or something close to that ,will be your best choice for a romantic ocean view dinner outside. You are actually above the ocean on a cliff overlooking the water. Please note, while there, they charged an addtional $50.00 per couple to guarentee an outside table for the 5:30 seating to view the sunset outside. With this you get a small appetizer and 2 glasses of champagne. To me....worth every penny to witness the sunset outside, front tables and sitting basically over the ocean. Dinner will cost around $150.00 or so per couple, depending on drinks. We ate there 2 times in 6 days, and average bill was $250.00 each visit with wine, or martinis. There is a shuttle that will take you to the shopping area up the road , or a 10 minute walk.Nice eateries there.Stay away from the public beach down the street located behind the Marriott. Not worth the trip, ...found out the hard way, but made the best out of it.You can catch a Van shuttle from the hotel and they will take you there, then you must call them for a pick at a shut on the beach. My suggestion is to rent a car at the hotel and drive to Kona and experience the area. We also experienced the Zip line tour, ATV tour and the Zodiac raft/snorkel trip.(you must provide your own transportation. Each about 40 minutes from hotel) I would pass on the Zodiac if you get the tad bit sea sick,as there is no place to sit while out there, so your options are ...if you feel sick are, sit on the boat for over an hour bobbing up and down while others snorkel, or jump in the water and count down the minutes until the hour and half go by. I took Bonine prior to going and was ok, but not 100%. Have been to Hawaii now for the 3rd time. This hotel is very nice, but not the Four Seasons...nor does it pretend to be. Great experience, and enjoy watching the Dolphin Quest at the restaurant on the side, or shell out the money and do it. You have to do it once in your life, this would be the place to do it. Heard the golfing was outstanding, but my idea of a vacation does not include getting frustrated hitting a little ball around the grounds....would much rather have a scotch, cigar and watch the ocean...thinking of those golfing. Aloha ", " Certainly one must understand that not everything can be perfect, and that money will always determine your experience, especially in Hawaii. If you review this resort from the perspective that money is no object, then I can't imagine what you might complain about. Yes, it is large resort but to complain about the walking seems trival, they do much to make your walks enjoyable. The service was kind, and more than accomodating. The lagoon pools, slides and water toys are great for children. There was places to lounge everywhere, but I imagine what time of year you stay could affect availability. Sure there may be a business conference filled with loud talking American insurance agents, but its good to see people having fun! ", " I visit the Hilton Waikoloa at least one to two times per year. Our 4 children enjoy the tram, the boats, the beach with kayaks and pools with slides. This recent visit was as good as any other time. My husband had a 2-day conference there for work and so we enjoyed the property while he was in meetings all day. The service is always impeccable. A night manager, Susie, always treats us with royalty. When she knows of our arrival, she will have our keys ready to pick up and our rooms ready earlier than check-in and a late check-out. She is awesome! She even upgraded us to a nice room once and our kids almost passed out from over excitement. I can't say enough about Susie at the Hilton Waikoloa... ", " Hilton gold member but stayed with package from Hilton Grand Vacations. We read reviews and were worried about property. When we checked in we requested Lagoon building which is much closer to big pool, Lagoon Spoon, and lobby. The boat was much faster than the tram because the tram would stop at each end 10 minutes every time we tried to ride it. The lagoon tower is an easy walk from lobby but not with luggage. The rooms were a bit worn (not flat screen tv) but had plenty of channels. As a gold member the hotel gave us vouchers for breakfast of $10 per day per person. At the Lagoon Spoon we were able to spend these for pastries (malassada-little sweet bun, small blueberry muffins, scones, and small croissants. We got special of 6 for $5 so with $10 we were able to get a dozen. We made coffee in room and the maids always left more or gave us more if we asked. NO EXTRA CHARGE. We saved the other vouchers and had dinner at he lagoon Grill. It closes at 7 so you must eat early or have lunch. Very nice location by dolphin pool and we found the food much better. The hamburger and pulled pork sandwich ($14 and $12) were great. They come with french fries, chips, or great battered onion rings. We split one and were quite happy. Even on the plan discount rate the hotel gave us an upgrade to oceanview for hhonors. Other people got upgrade for asking if it was available. Lagoon pool was nice but they provide no shade. No umbrellas and few trees. At one end by waterfall on right side there is shade but these spots go fast. Also under foot rope bridge there is some shade but everyone heads for these spots. There are 2 plans for extras one for $4.50 which includes coffee (which we got for free) ,unlimited local calls, work out room passes,(most high end Hiltons charge for workout/except for status members), $25 credit for lagoon beach toy rentals, and one hour at Kohala Tennis Garden. A value for $4.50 if you use it. The other package is $25 per day but also includes Seaside putting course golf for 2 people, Hi -speed internet, 2 beverages (Mai Tai, wine , beer) plus most of the $4.50 package. Since mai tais can cost $11 x 2=$22 this is a great value, Also my wife is handicapped and the hotel provided free valet parking with showing of sticker. In our experience this hotel went out of its way to make our vacation easy. ", " This place is exceptional, what an experience! We stayed in the Palace section which was in the middle of the resort. It was nice because you could access all areas easily from there. Rooms on the second floor of the palace are at grade level with patios. Parking was a ways away, but with the trams and boats you can get anywhere easily. You can expect to do a lot of walking at this resort to get to the pools and lagoon, so make sure you are in shape. It's probably the the ideal setup for people with mobility issues since there are quite a few bridges to cross. Definitly check this place out. ", " Wow this was the best hotel stay on our trip. We arrived in the foyer of the hotel having picked up our car (Alamo) at the airport, driven through the lava fields, the resort is lush. The receptionist said, take the train or the boat to your room. It is an expansive resort with alot of accomodation options. We chose a lagoon room over the dolphin pool (the room was cozy, a little dated), the room was a good size with a lounge and table and chairs, close to the Kona pool with waterslides and hot tubs, the orchid restaurant is located here selling takeaway salads, sandwiches, hot dogs and pizzas. Great for lunch and early dinners. We moved on to the Lagoon pool the next day hiring paddleboards, surfskis, paddle boats and snorkelling and swimming with the 5 turtles that live in the lagoon, stingrays and angel fish also. On the far side of the resort are the ocean towers which also have a pool with slides. The lagoon towers were the best for close proximity to the shops, pools and dolphin quest. The hotel had a shuttle bus to the two local shopping centres, kings and queens village, the island gourmet ABC and the Whalers Store stocked everything we needed. The lagoon grill was great for lunch and well priced. There is a small beach a fair distance from the hotel. We drove around the island stopping at the volcano, it was 3 hours there and three back, it was a long day. If your wanting to see lava flow I would do the helicopter at night. The boys went on the manta ray dive unfortunately the manta rays didnt appear. The shopping was good especially at the sports authority in Kona. A great hotel in a good location, close to the airport. Kylie Baldock (Sydney, Australia) ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for 9 nights in April 2010. It is, quite honestly, the most luxurious, nicest, most expensive place we've ever stayed at on any of our travels, and we've been all over the world. However, you get what you pay for. The hotel itself was amazing. It's so big that there are two monorail trains and two canal boats to take you to the tower that your room is in (there are four towers altogether). There's a wedding chapel, several restaurants, a huge conference centre, many swimming pools, a dolphin habitat, a suspension bridge, waterslides in the pools, several waterfalls, mini-golf (we played glow-in-the-dark mini golf at night, which was fun), and the gardens are spectacular. Everything is ship-shape and spotless. Our room was spacious and everything worked. The beds were soooooo comfy! The best part of this hotel was the private lagoon with its white sand beach and abundance of lounge chairs and cabanas. We swam with up to 8 large green sea turtles, every single day! The turtles like the bubbles that form under the waterfall, so that's where they hang out. They swam right up to us, looked us in the eye, then turned and swam away - they're completely harmless. We also saw angel fish, parrot fish, clown fish, puffer fish, and several eels (harmless), plus some varities of fish I can't name.Drinks are expensive there - averaging $11 apiece. The restaurants aren't cheap either. I would highly recommend taking the shuttle ($1 per person; they run every 20 minutes) to the nearby Queen's Shops and buying groceries to take back to your room, especially for breakfasts and lunches. You'll save a lot of money that way. Coffee cost $4.50, a muffin was $4.95, and a little 8 oz. serving of yogurt cost $2.50! There is no shuttle to the Kona airport, and our taxi cost $66 one way.There are several incentives to \"give up 90 minutes of your time to listen to our time share presentation\", which we said no to.The staff are very friendly, and the hotel itself is superb. We truly did feel like we were in paradise and it was hard to leave. ", " This place is Paradise on Earth! We actually enjoyed the fact this it is so big! There is so much to see and do and everywhere you look is breathtaking! Beautiful manicured clean grounds, ocean views, lagoon with dolphins, pools, what else would you want??We enjoyed walking through the resort and stroll through all the different pathways. If you are tired, you can always take the boat or the tram back to your room. Not fast but what's the hurry??? You are on vacation remember? The boat ride around the resort is actually very pleasant and allow your feet to rest.Our son loved this place. The pools, the water slides, the lagoon, snorkling, everything!Food is expensive but we found it to be no more than any other resorts. I ate the best steak filet ever at the KPC restaurant. Here are my best tips:1. Reserve all Big Island activities on-line prior to departure and save a bundle! We booked the helicopter ride and Atlantis submarine tour on-line and saved over $100.002. Reserve a car ahead of time if you plan on visiting the island. Highly recommended, even just for a few days. Not only you can go sightseeing but also can stop in town at Walmart for supplies. If you don't reserve a car ahead of time, you may not get one.3. Go to Walmart at the beginning of your trip for supplies. We filled the fridge in our room with jam, milk, cheese, butter and other goodies. We even bought a toaster at Walmart (that cost $7.52), bread, baggles, peanut butter and had breakfast in our room every day! We left the toaster behind but this small investment saved us a lot of money!4. Bring a soft cooler bag. We filled it with the ice machine at the hotel. It kept our drinks cold. Perfect for bottle water and soft drinks.5. Bring a large beach bag. Certainly needed to take all your stuff down to the lagoon or pools.6. Before you pick a hotel, beware of the weather patterns. Each island has a wet and dry side. We know people who stayed in Hilo and it rained all week. Hilo gets 240\" of rain per year where Waikoloa only gets 8\". That's what makes it so nice! You are almost guaranteed good weather by going to this resort.There is a free shuttle to the beach next door. Takes 5 minutes to get there.There is a shuttle to a nice shopping area near by (King and Queen shops). It cost $1 each way to take the shuttle but could easily walk there. The Queen's shopping area has a food court if you wish to eat a cheap meal. The Queen's market is a grocery store. It has fresh sandwhishes and plenty of eating options if you do not wish to eat at the resort.Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. It was clean, friendly staff and does not feel crowded since it is so big. We visited many other Hotels and they have nothing compared to all the Hilton has to offer. Can't wait to go back. ", " We were at Hilton waikola village for 3 days.Our stay was awesome .It has everything You dont have to go out of it.IT has many swimming pools infact they have logaoon to which water from sea enters and you can see all types of fishes we even saw turtle :) Its on the beach , you can sit and just enjoy the view .The Budha point its beautiful, the perfect place to watch sunset and whales.....The property is huge and they have boats and tram to travel from one end to other....its awesome....But the food inside the resort its just bad...dont try it. ", " My husband and I went to the Hilton Waikoloa Village on our honeymoon. It was wonderful. The sights at the resort alone were unbelievable. Their website pictures(hiltonwaikoloavillage.com) does not do it justice. We stayed in the Ocean Towers and had a room with a view of beautiful gardens, mountains in the distance and the ocean at one side. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The luau was very beautiful and entertaining.We also saw some whales from the hammock at \"Buddha Point\" just outside the Ocean Towers. Having trouble with the 5 hour time change, we woke up around 3 am the first night. Our curtains were open and the lights on the resort shone on the palm trees that cast beautiful shadows on our walls. It looked like a mural! I was able to capture the pictures using a slow shutter speed.Every one of the many pools were beautful in their own way. Many slides, waterfalls, the dolphin lagoon(the dolphin interaction was way too expensive! No, we didn't pay the $205 they wanted for 20 minutes of feeding the dolphins!)The only negative is that it is over 20 miles from Kailua-Kona where you can find a Walmart, among other stores and cheap restaurants. The resort has some restaurants, which are a little pricey, but good food. We were there during the tsunami warning and had to evacuate for a few hours, but the hotel gave us a free buffet dinner that evening to compensate us for the inconvenience.To save money, go through \"Hilton Grand Vacations\" and do the 2 hour presentation for the timeshare(it's not worth buying into), but you will save a bundle.Also, if you decide to make reservations, make sure you get the room you reserve. We did have a little trouble when we first arrived, as they tried to give us a room that overlooked the golf course when we reserved a garden view room. If you don't speak up for yourself, you may get taken advantage of here. We got our garden view which as I stated also had a view of the ocean and mountains. It was incredible! ", " The day we arrived at Hilton was the day of the Tsunami threat, much of the Island closed down as most employees took their families to higher ground during the morning and early afternoon. This left the Hilton understaffed. All the restaurants on the property were closed, as were most of the restaurants in the area. In the evening the Hilton sponsored complementary buffet dinner for all the guests on the property. We learned from some of the guests that earlier in the day the Hilton had bused the guests to a country club at higher elevation and provided fool and fun. I take my hat off to the Staff and Management of the Hilton Waikoloa for caring for the safety, welfare, and enjoyment at time of crisis and post-crisis. ", " I was there for a conference and a holiday, we stayed here just over a week, and had another week in an excellent B&B. Our room was probably one of the cheaper types available (golf club view in the Palace tower), but was perfectly fine, a decent size with a comfortable bed. This is the most amazing hotel I have every stayed in (and I have stayed in quite a few). The pools and lagoon are great to swim in, the art works are wonderful and make you feel good, some of the restaurants (eg KPC) are very good. The hotel provides a really excellent experience, and although such extravagance is not normal for me, they do it very well indeed. This is an expensive hotel, with most things extra, and costing well over the odds; however we did get a free ride to and from the adjacent beach, and especially valued, a free whale watching cruise which was one of the highlights of our stay. The hotel is quite some way (both physical and psycological) from 'real Hawaii', but is easy to recommend as long as it is not the only place you go. ", " Even though everything is very, very expensive... this is a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. Pools: You have many choices. My favorite is the one which they created with a sandy bottom and beach and warm ocean water from the ocean. Complete with fish and turtles! This one also has a waterfall. If you have children, you can rent a variety of water items, such as paddle boats, paddle boards, canoe, etc. It was so relaxing.Usually Hilton's do not seem to be set up for families - but this place is. There are activities daily - such as lei making or playing a ukelele - bright birds in the lobby for children to see, slides into the outdoor pools, and more. Evenings are especially enjoyable. I felt safe walking around. And, you will want to walk around. There is artwork everywhere you go. The evenings are amazingly relaxing and beautiful. Staff were friendly and helpful with anything we asked. There are a couple of offices set up to help you see/do anything you wish on the island. They aren't pushy and really did make an effort to find out what kind of things I liked to do. I came back Sooooooo relaxed. I really did enjoy this hotel. ", " Just spent 10 nights at Hilton Waikloa and pretty damn close to paradise. Second stay here in 2 years and given travelled all the way from the UK that should tell you how good it is !Lovely weather on the Kona side of the island and even the sea was \"warm\" to swim in. Don't know how you could ever get bored at this resort, waking up to views of the Pacific every morning or alternatively views of Mauna Kea & Mauna Loa. We were there during Whale Watching season and to watch Humpbacks crashing out of the sea just 500-600 m from your balcony is breath taking. The whole place is nature lovers dream with the dolphins to watch any time you want and you can get very close to their pools and then the fish, rays, turtles etc. in the lagoon and the whales just offshore...well, you be the judge. Staff very friendly but not pushy for tips, food was second to none but a bit pricey and 3 great freshwater pools when your bored of the lagoon. Lying in a hammock on the ocean edge at dusk, surrounded by palm trees with a stunning setting sun you just feel like Robinson Crusoe.WILL go back as soon as I can...love the place. ", " The only negative about this Hilton is the layout of the resort itself. By the time you get to your rental car, it would be a half hour before you could get back to your room if you forgot anything. Otherwise the hotel was very nice and had a commanding view of breaching whales and coastline. Any night life is a hour away so if you are looking for a faster scene stay in Kona. ", " This is the most exclusive resort I have ever been to! The place is amazing and the amenities phenomenal. If you looking to get away from everithing there is no better place. ps: do the observatory tour! ", " Loved the property. Its a huge resort with train and boat service from one tower to the other. They have many beautiful large pools and plenty of lounge chairs around the pools and the beach. The lagoon grill served great food and also had a happy hour in the evenings. The lagoon spoon had good breakfast cereal and one bowl was big enough for the both of us to start the day. There is a chinese restaurant which is not that great and we didn't try the Japanese one. The sunsets were just amazing from the Kohala pool-side. There are dolphin activities for kids and other watersports in the resort which we didn't try but it was still fun to lounge around and watch. We would just take a long moonlight walk at night and that was so relaxing. The boats and trains are a fun idea and although it may be faster to just walk, we still tried those a few times. The lobby is huge and was always crowded for some reason, but they had complimentary fruit infused water there which was a lifesaver in the heat. The room we stayed in was quite spacious and we had no complaints. The resort served its purpose to make us feel totally relaxed and happy. We also enjoyed the King's and Queen's market place a lot, although too expensive to shop there. They had a live concert one night and always had other activities in the evenings.The only tip I would offer is skip the restaurants at the Hilton and try the Charlie's Thai (best pineapple fried rice) and Meriman's market cafe (awesome desserts) in the marketplace... ", " You are either going to love this place or hate it. We just completed our 4th stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. There are many reasons we return. First and foremost is our stay is free when we redeem our Hilton Honors points. However, we paid for our very first stay and fell in love with the property and the Big Island. This resort covers over 60 acres so if you enjoy exercise there's ample opportunity to hike, jog, or swim. This year I finally remembered to bring a pedometer. We logged over 10,000 steps every day, mostly from hiking on the resort. There are trams and boats to take you to the main places if you'd rather not walk. The staff has always been courteous and helpful. Some have gone out of their way to enhance our stay. Our room was comfortable, although if the sound of birds bothers you in the morning, do not request the Ocean Tower. The in room minibar has finally disappeared. Instead we enjoyed having a small refrigerator. No longer did we have to pay for coffee. It is now one of the amenities. Shampoo, conditioner and lotion from the Kohala Spa is are added treats.Food is available and varied, although we were disappointed to find Donatoni's had closed. The breakfast buffet, although pricey, is out of this world. Fresh fruit from the island and a wide variety of entrees will fill up the most fussy eater. Watching the sunset from Kamuela Provision Company is beautiful. We suggest having a drink and appetizer on the patio rather than the expensive entrees. People watching is great. You will see all sorts of people from all over the world. Even the shopping on the resort is good. There's a terrific art gallery - see Martina for finding what suits you.There are nearby shopping centers, restaurants, and a lot of cultural sites. Kona is only about 20 minutes away. Before you schedule your vacation here, be sure to check out the Waikoloa Village online so you know what to expect. For us, we highly recommend it and would return tomorrow if we could. ", " My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for five nights at the start of a four week vacation. We wanted to be able to relax and do very little, and this resort was perfect for that. The grounds are beautiful and expansive, with multiple options for swimming, sunbathing, and poolside drinking. We had a deluxe ocean view room and were very happy with it. The bed was extremely comfortable. We appreciated that the housekeeping staff tidied our room without making it seem like we weren't there - for example, they realised that we'd removed the decorative pillow from the bed for a reason, and never put it back.The resort makes a big deal of having dolphins that you can swim with for a fee, but we were more excited about the sea turtles in the lagoon. The lagoon is free to use and is home to a number of sea turtle. You can hire paddle boats, canoes etc, but we simply swam out near the waterfall and within a few minutes were having close encounters with beautiful large turtles. Highly recommended!We attended the \"Legends of the Pacific\" luau one night - an easy way to get some pre-packaged \"culture,\" but not for anyone chasing an authentic experience.Some comments suggest that the grounds are too big - the train and the boat run every 10 minutes or so, but we generally walked. It took about 15 minutes to get from our room in the Ocean Tower to the main lobby, at a relaxed pace. We weren't on vacation to rush! The \"Museum Walkway\" keeps things interesting.If you're there for the pools, stay in the Lagoon Tower - it's closest to the best pool. The Ocean Tower would be most convenient for golfing. We also heard a surprising amount of noise at night coming from the Boat Landing Pavilion outside.Considering all the amenities available to resort guests, I think this was very good value for money. Food and drink in the resort is quite expensive, but there is a shuttle running to the local King's and Queen's shops. The shuttle leaves from the lower lobby every 10/15 minutes and costs $1 per person, per trip. We went to the Queen's shops most nights, especially enjoying the ABC shop for take-away alcohol and souvenirs, and Macaroni's for dinner.Many tours will pick you up from the resort, so it doesn't matter if you don't have a car (we didn't). I recommend a tour of the Volcanoes National Park. The guest services are wonderful for helping you book tours, although we had one concierge try to get us to the timeshare presentation.In conclusion, a beautiful resort, perfect for an easy, relaxing vacation. ", " My wife and I spent two nights here and wished we had stayed 3 or 4. I requested a quiet room and was given one in the Palace Tower. It was very quiet, but far removed from the pools and other activities. This resort is HUGE and seemed very uncrowded when we were there. Everything is pretty spread out. There is a tram and also a boat to get you around, but we wound up walking A LOT rather than waiting for the transport. Maybe the trams and boats run more often when there are more guests.The pools are spectacular and very inviting, but it was too cold for us to want to swim, though some brave souls were in the water.One complaint I had was that I generally try to get a little work done in the morning before my wife wakes up. I wasted a lot of time wandering around trying to find coffee and a spot that had an electrical outlet, wifi, and decent cell service, and never found one with all three. I wound up going back to the room and trying not to disturb my wife too much.TIP: We did the Mauna Kea Summit Adventures Sunset/Stargazing Tour from here and highly recommend it. ", " you take a boat or a trolly to get to your room and aruond the facility. they have 3 major 4 star resturants, they have water slides, 5 different swimming pools, a museum walk way, asian art sculptures, dolphins on site, and their own personal lagune. best service and amazing fun! oh and no worries for the wemon they have a major spa and tons of shopping stores on site as well. ", " We just returned from a week at this hotel. It was great. It is beautiful, clean, and fabulously landscaped. The pools are quite cool (75 degrees), but once you get in, it's fine. We were here during whale-watching season and you could see the whales breach from the shore of the hotel and at Buddha Point. It is also a great place to watch the sunset. We made drinks in the room and took them out there to enjoy. We went on a snorkeling excursion using Ocean Sports - they were great too! Staff was very friendly and helpful! We also went to the Islands of the Pacific Luau - well....we'd never been to a luau, but I would not go again. It wasn't horrible, but we did not feel it was worth the $$$. The restaurants are ok....we ate at Imari (Japanese) and KPC (great place to have a sunset dinner). The 'boat landing' restaurant had great 'grab-n-go' sushi and drinks. Olympics were on, so we'd have lunch here and catch up. The Kimo Bean Coffee place had bagels, pastries, smoothies and coffee. It was much cheaper than the $30 per person breakfast at 'The Water's Edge'. There are trams and boats, but they do take a while - we chose to walk instead. It provided for a little extra exercise (something we do not do when on vacation). Although, they have a fitness center that was very nice. They have tennis courts, golf course, etc. We had a rental car and they do charge you for parking daily ($15), but it is in and out as many times as you'd like.The Queens marketplace and the Kings shops were great. They are just down the street from the resort. We ate at a fabulous Sushi restaurant called 'Sansei'. Also there's an ABC store, Starbucks, and a food court too.Also - note - if you fly American Airlines and dont have a flight out until 10pm.... the counters at the airport do not open until 7:30pm, so do NOT get to the airport early. You cannot enter security without having checked your bags, and you can't check your bags until the counters open! :) ", " We just got back 2 weeks ago. This resort was the most awesome place we have stayed in Hawaii so far. We went 5 years ago and stayed at the Marriott in Waikoloa and it does not hold a candle to this place. It is huge though and that is why they have a tram and boats to get you around, but we walked most of the time. They have the most amazing dolphin interaction area by a cute little lunch cafe in the resort too. We had a beautiful partial ocean view/partial golf course view room and the room was very large and comfortable. Can't wait to go back in a few years. Kelly, Michigan ", " After a solid month of touring the continental USA our last week was to be at the Hilton Waikoloa. We had a seamless check-in and got a complimentary bottle of champagne because it was our Anniversary.The room we had was 5324 in Lagoon Tower overlooking the ocean. Amazing view of the Pacific Ocean, the dolphin pool and Mauna Kea. The sunrise over Mauna Kea and the sunset over the Pacific were awesome. The rooms are nice, albeit the bed is a little small for a double but who cares? The pools are nice as is the spa and pool bar. We had the lu'au at the resort and we all loved it.After reading other reviews, those who whine about walking 10 or so minutes because of the size of the property suggests to me you NEED to walk because you probably could shed 50 to 100lbs of excess weight. Also the birds at the Lagoon tower at morning and night are great. Again some whine about the noise. Geez get over it, its called nature. You know that thing we seem to lose touch of now and then?Overall this place is on my recommendation list. Come here for a serious relaxing time. Also take a drive to Mauna Kea and Loa. You will not regret it! ", " My daughter and I spent a week at the Hilton and loved every moment. Although we didn't get an ocean view room, I wasn't disappointed as I thought I would be. Our daytime activities gave us plenty of opportunities to view the ocean. The Hilton doesn't have a sandy ocean front beach, but they do provide a shuttle that can take you to the 'A Bay beach in a very short time. There is a sandy beach in the lagoon area pool if you don't want to leave the hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Check out time was noon, but they were able to extend it to 2 pm. When we went to check out and told them that our flight wasn't leaving until 11 pm, the young lady serving us told us where our luggage could be stored. She also told us that we could use the pools and other facilities and told us a room would be available (for 45 min.) so we could shower. Although we had received coupons for the Big Island Breakfast, I think I would have been willing to pay the $24.95 for the buffet. We ended up eating a larger breakfast than we normally would do, but then we really didn't eat much for lunch or dinner. Yes, the parking lot is a good walk from the main lobby, but as long as you remember everything before you head out, it really isn't that bad. One advantage is that not too many rooms would end up having a view of the parking lot. By the way, be sure to rent a car before you leave home. I heard that people sometimes have difficulty because there might not be cars available. If I ever had the opportunity to go to the Big Island again, I would not hesitate going back to the Hilton. However, I don't think I would want to stay at the Lagoon Tower. We were walking around there around dusk and the birds were really loud! If it were that noisy all day long, I think it would become annoying. ", " Great Hotel the best pools lagoon,waterfalls. Took our grandaughter, she loved it. Food a bit expensive so ate outside the hotel sometimes, but there was so much to do at the hotel. Went swimming with the dolphins. All around wonderful stay. ", " When we first looked at this hotel we were a little concerned it might be like a theme park but don't worry it's not. The Hilton is a large hotel where you have plenty of space and don't feel crowded. Yes your room can be a long way from Reception but they thought about that and they have a mono-rail style train and boat that transports guests around the resort. Even if you decide to walk it's only a 10-15 minute stroll from one side to the other. The hotel is set in a beautiful bay with a fantastic lagoon where you can swim with the exotic fish and turtles. They have 15 Dolphins in their own lagoon and you can watch the free show every Tuesday or have a one to one interactive show for a fee. We sat and watched them every day, they are such wonderful animals. The Hotel is located just North of Kona airport and acts as a great baseto explore this amazing Island. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are spacious and clean. This hotel is all about the outside space and I could not fault it, we will be going back despite the 16 hour plane journey. The only down side is that as with all Hilton's they haven't quite got that expensive isn't always better. At $15 for a round on the putting green it's hardly surprising that in the 14 days we were there no-one used it. I felt sorry for the staff who had to sit there all day alone. The drinks in the hotel were expensive and the Luau at the Hilton was $99 while the same event with the same entertainment was only $49 in the Hotel next door. I know you get spoiled with how cheap Spa's are in Asia but $130 for an hour seems quite high too especially as it was nice but nothing special.All that said we still loved the Hotel and Hawaii. Everyone should visit once in their lifetime. ", " My husband and I stayed at the hotel as we were celebrating our 15th Anniversary and also this is were we stayed for part of our honeymoon 15 years ago. First of all I have to ackknowledge some EXCEPTIONAL staff who made our stay there very special. Romulo and Sally who were our waitress/ waiter in the Waters Edge Buffet Breakfast along with Ester and Connie who was a hostesses there just made us feel like family and went to EVERY extreme to make us comfortable there. Needless to say I became very attached to them. I hope they will be compensated/acknowledged by their manger's for their outstanding work and friendliness. They are an asset to the Hilton Waikoloa Village and I miss them already. Mahalo for everything!Also, the bellmen and car hop personnel were ALWAYS friendly and prompt in service. My goodness, the property is really a true TROPICAL PARDISE! Unfortunatel there are some problems that really need to be addressed. Tthe maid service wasn't at all up to standards in cleaning our room. I asked the first day on a note for them to PLEASE polish/clean the furniture and clean the glass night stand and table top along with the big buffet chest with glass shelves as it was pretty dirty upon arrival to our room and me with allergies it was tough. This request never was done. I realize that maybe the room hadn't been occupied for a day or two and dust builds up but I think for a luxuary resort maid service should double check the rooms before guests check into a room so everything is fresh and clean.I also think that the hotel should consider installing shower bar handles near the wall/tub when you get out as the tub is slippery and could be a potential safety problem. Rubber mats would be an issue of too germy.Also, We would like to see the hotel install a shower caddy in bathtub as there is really no where to put your shampoo ect. and things kept falling into the tub.No microwave in rooms! We think there should be one in at least the upgraded rooms that cost more which we paid for in such a luxuary resort as this one.Room Refrigerator was horrible! It never kept milk cold enough so we had to just throw what we bought away. We were told by other employee's that management knows about this but WHY isn't something done? Doesn't seem right.One last comment...If the resort would consider doing the luau at a more senic spot facing the ocean we would of for sure come to your luau but due to that reason of your luau being right near the tennis courts with NO senic water view we ended up going next door to the Brand New Marriott and they had an ideal spot right by the ocean and the entertainment and food was SUPERB!!! ", " We recently returned from the waikoloa village from a family trip with our 5 year old daughter. We enjoyed an amazing upgraded room with flawless appointments thanks to wonderful staff and our hilton diamond status. We dined well at the chinese and lagoon restaurants. we udes our coupons for hilton honors members well at the coffe bar for breakfast and ice cream to die for at dessert. The kids programs was unmatched in activities and staff. it was hard to get our daughter Charlotte to leave! She learned lots about hawaii and really enjoyed the luau and swimming pool. we enjoyed time alone together and dinner at KPC(you might want to split here as portions are huge and prices higher).  Before our trip I read reviews here which gave me pause, but I was 100% satisfied. While it is true the walks can be long around property, we enjoyed every minut of the scenery around us. Only people with disabilties or no patience for the lovely boat rides should factor the size of the property as a negative. It truly was a grand village and spaced accordingly. I would not hesitate to give the team of the hilton a chance to prove some of these reviews wrong!!! We will be back!And that is from Charleston SC with a 5 year old in tow. Its just that special. ", " So you are going to the big island and staying at the Hilton Waikola. My husband won this trip through our job and I raed every review so I thought I'd share. The resort is huge, don't be afraid to explore and wander around. Rent a car before you go, we scoured the internet and got a convertable for $350 from alamo. Alot of people from our grop tried renting a car and they were sold out. It was nice to leave and just drive around. We stayed in the ocean tower, I woke up every morning and watched the whales blow their blow holes. We ate at only 2 places KPC for valentines day and Impari the japanese steak house. Both were really good, cool atmosphere, friendly service. We also ate at the kona hot dog stand by the pool, 2 drumstick ice cream cones came to $8 and a can of sprite was $2.70.The sunsets are amazing and a handful of people gather out by the buddah to take amazing photos. A guy actually runs through and lights all the torches for the sunset and then blows the conch shell, it was pretty cool.Deffinatly do a luau I saw 2.our work rented out the lagoon lanai in the convention center for the waikoloa luau. It was fun, hula dancers, good food, the host was funny. But the best Luau I went to was Gathering of the kings about 10 minutes away at the orchid hotel (google gathering of the kings) It was AMAZING! Awesome food from around all the islands, open bar with frozen drinks, the show was just fabulous, almost like a broadway show, great music, great story, in fact when you get there they take a proffesional photo of you wearing prop leis. it was $40 for a set of pictures which we bought. I also bought the soundtrack to the show. I think it was $100 plus $25 for the VIP seating which we did. You get appetizers, better seating and you get to get your food first. You also get better leis, we got big black stones and the regular seaters got skinny yellow beads.most of our activities were off the resort, we did do the couples massage at the kona spa, I was under the impression that it would be outside but it was inside in a small room. It was still nice though.We played golf at the kings course, bring your camera deffinatly some great photo ops there. The resort provides free shuttle service, just walk out the front , turn left and tell the guy in the greenish yellow shirt where you want to go.We rented ATV's through atv outfitters, it's about 40 minutes away. Awesome tour! we rode through jungles, and then stopped to walk down a very steep, rock trail toa 80 foot waterfall, the walk was steep, but there was a rope railing to hold on to so it wasn't too bad, the view was amazing. We swam in it, only one other person from the group did, it was chilly but when do you get to swim in a spring fed waterfall!?now here are a couple of things that went wrong. Learn from my mistakes :)We rented a fishing boat. Thought it'd be cool to go deep sea fishing. I envisioned, catching fish, boating on the great sea, having a picnic under the blue sky of hawaii. We rented the camelot. We had to get up at 4:45 to get to the harbour by 6:15 which wasn't bad because it's still 70 degrees. The guys from the camelot were really cool, friendly.. we were supposed to have this boat from 6:30-noon. We were back in our hotel by 9:30. We got sooooo seasick, it was just insane. I was ok until the sun came up and then I got real nauseas, i look at my husband and his face is litteraly green, The boat was so rocky you could barely walk around, as soon as you moved around you were flung around, not at all what I envisioned.. I won't even lie, we both puked off the side of the boat, we were just misearble. I had to tell the guy to turn around. We were an hour and a half out and it took an hour and a half to get back. We were sick for the rest of the day, we just felt miserable. I will never go on a boat again. In fact I had reseervations for the sunset on valentines day but i cancled it as soon as we got to the hotel. Which brings me to the volcano park. you can get to the volcano park in 21/2 hours if you cut across the island. we decided to go up and around to do some site seeing. This took 51/2 hours to get there. It's funny though because you drive and the scenery changes drastically from tropical, to desert with cactus, to farm land with cows grazing, to forests and pin trees, also it is chilly in the volcan park so bring a light jacket and jeans. We did the thurston lava tube which was neat, then we did the drive down to the road that is covered by an old lava spill. Here's where it gets good,lol.Ok so you drive 36 miles down a road, along the way you have to keep your windows up because of the toxic gasses (vog) that the volcano emits.You get down there and you park your car so you can walk out and continue to follow the road that is covered by lava. I had brought a flashlight but left it in the car because I figured wed stay on this road. I was wrong. We follow the road see that it ends in old lava, from a distance you can see actual lava from the volcano. to get a closer look you can walk on the l;ava rocks. The lava rocks are insane, it sounds like crunching glass when you walk on them, there are miles and miles of lava rocks and they huge, and cracked, and there are craters, crevices, some are 3 feet tall and you have to climb over, there are holes that are deep it's hard to truly grasp the conceprt of these things unless you've been there. Ok so it's sunset and in hawii once the sun huits the ocean its 180 seconds until darkness. This is the time my husband suggests we start heading back. We start walking and it gets dark. we get lost, all you can see our theses lava rocks for miles, we had no light, no cell phone (it was dead) no water. we are slowly walking back, tryiong not to lose our foorting, I am crying the whole time, i ended up falling in a hole, i cut my thumb and my thigh is bruised, it was nightmare. It took us an hour and a half to find our way back.I can't even write in words how stupid and scary that was.well last but not least, bring sunscreen, and bring a sun hat! I didn't bring a hat and my scalp got sunburned, also bring toilet paper if you are going for a long car drive there aren't many towns and gas stations don't have bathrooms. this is a quiet island at 9pm there were no other cars out. oh and the people at this resort were so self entitled, we saw a guy get yelled at because he let his kids swim in the adult pool after hours,lol Who does that? People would just walk right into you and act like they didn't see you. I t was pretty annoying how people acted there. The only annoyance I had was people letting there kids be loud, scream to each other from their balconies, i was at the pool and this family let their 3 year old wander by the edge of the pool, just insane. Also there are no lifeguards at the resort, so watch your kids.Enjoy your trip! ", " Had a wonderful time with the family at Hilton Waikoloa Village. The Costco deal worked out great! It provided free hard-wire internet access from the room, wifi is only in the main lobby. Only downside is the mattress, it could be more firm and the two beds were only double versus full size. We stayed at the Palace Towers and it was great! It is much more grand than the other towers. It is a little further to walk but still closer to than the Ocean Tower and I would avoid Lagoon Tower. To get to the market (King's Shopping and Queen's Shopping), just ask for the Hilton Shuttle to Marriot. From the Marriot you can just walk over else you will have to wait 30 mins for the shuttle and I believe there maybe a cost. The Hilton shuttle to Marriot is free. Now the place I highly recommend is the Blazing Steaks in King's Shopping next to Macy's. It is absolutely the best deal. You can get a Chicken and Steak combo with rice for $7, that is an excellent deal and much better than eating in the resort. The Costco deal does provide you with two breakfast and kids under 5 is free. If you go to the volcano, I would recommend driving up north, the drive will be much more pleasant and you can stop by in the Akaka Waterfalls. I would recommend stopping off at Costco and Walmart for any supplies you may need before you head to the hotel. If you want good snokeling without paying for anyone taking you out via a boat, go to the Pu'uhonu o Honaunau National Historical Park aka \"Place of Refuge\". You will see schools of fish and the water is clear. The downside is that it is about 1.5 hours south from Hilton. Overall the family had a great time! ", " This resort is gorgeous and I am still having visions of the place weeks after returning. The resort provides an abundant mix of nature, culture, art and history on its grounds and in its buildings. We loved all of the activities we did: paddle boating, interacting with dolphins, walking the Pacific promenade, listening to live music in the evening and the luau. Walking through this resort is like walking through paradise. It has flowering bushes, palm trees, birds, lizards, fish, dolphins, artwork, historic artifacts, waterfalls, a water canal with boat, brook, pools, lagoons, bays, and beautiful views of the Pacific with whales breaching and spouting occasionally. During the winter months, humpback whales migrate from Alaska to mate in the warm Hawaiian waters. Smart whales!The resort also reminded us of Disney because of the monorail and canal boat that transport guests and visitors around this very large resort. Because of its size and design, it does take a day or two to determine the easiest ways to get around and you do have to walk a lot to get to certain places around the resort. The self service parking lot is pretty far from the hotel rooms, but you can drop your family member(s) and possessions at the main lobby and then park the car yourself or use valet parking for a higher charge. During our stay, self parking was $15/day and valet was $21/day.I was concerned about mobility issues once I saw how large this resort is and how difficult it can be to get around. I spoke to a woman in a motorized scooter who said she didn't have a problem getting around, but we agreed that it might be more difficult for someone in a wheelchair. There are spots around the resort where it appears only stairs and a bridge get you over a water canal, lagoon or pool.Dolphin Quest is on the property. It's a separate company from the Hilton, although you can charge your activities or gift shop purchases to your room. It's a lot of fun to play with and watch the dolphins. If you are a fan of dolphins, I strongly recommend doing an encounter with the dolphins and staying in the Lagoon Tower which has views of the dolphin pools and ocean. There is another salt water lagoon where sea turtles, fish and eels swim and where guests can swim, snorkel, canoe, paddle surf, or paddle boat. We had a great time watching a family of sea turtles eating leaves for breakfast and fish jumping out of the water while we sat in the paddle boat.The Water's Edge Restaurant was quite expensive for breakfast ($65 for two adults), but the Lagoon Grille and Chinese restaurant seemed more reasonable for lunch and dinner. The Lagoon Grille which opens at 11 AM has a great view of the dolphins and trainers. There are refrigerators in the rooms if you need one.Regarding quietness at this resort, there are minor birds who squawk in the trees in the middle of the night (3 AM for example). So, if you are a light sleeper, we recommend you bring ear plugs or find another resort. The birds can get quite loud and wake you up. But during the day, the resort was quiet.There is also a charming wedding chapel with a view of the ocean and wedding planner at the resort. The hotel was holding wedding vow renewal ceremonies weekly during our stay. There is no residency requirement in Hawaii to obtain a marriage license if you need one. The luau at the Hilton is not held every night of the week, so check the schedule with the hotel when booking your dates. There are other luaus at other locations around the island.We don't go back to too many hotels that are not close to home, but we liked this resort so much I'm sure we'll return someday. ", " We were attending a family wedding in Honolulu and evaluated both the Hilton and the Westin on the big island. We chose the Hilton and made the right choice. First off, travelling with two small children, it was great to have the number of pools - some massive, some tiny. We had an entire afternoon in a pool just with our family.I also appreciated the volume of resteraunts. The snack bar was great for breakfast and the diversity of places to eat made it a lot easier for us to enjoy our stay without getting sick of the same menu.The complex was really large, but the tram was fun to take for the kids and if we wanted to get somewhere quickly.The drawback was that the beach/lagoon area was really small and didn't look very natural. The waterfall was really cool, though. ", " I read poor reviews of this hotel prior to departing for Hawaii. I was so pleased to have only great experiences. The hotel staff was terrific and everyone was very friendly and helpful. One morning the car could not be located by the valet staff and within a short time frame they brought us a Budget rental car and sent us on our way while they located the car. The car was similar to another and had been left in the self-parking so was found with no problem. We never encountered a negative staff member.Our room was upgraded and we enjoyed a week of watching the dolphins and a beautiful view of the ocean from the Lagoon Tower. The birds did not disturb us at all and we enjoyed their morning and evening chatter. The beds were very comfortable and the room spacious. Recommendation for improvement would be better coffee and hotter water in the shower. Water temperature was okay but not a hot shower.The grounds are beyond description....beauty everywhere and so well planned. I enjoyed walks over the property from end to end. The natural beauty is enhanced by the beautiful art sculptures.My mother has trouble walking long distances so we used the trams and boats and they were great. We never had to wait long and it was a big help for her plus enjoyable. The walk to our room was not bad and we were at the end of the Lagoon Tower but she needed the extra help and it was a great service.We took the local shuttle train to the Market and it was also very helpful. While waiting a Hilton staff member offered to drive us to the Marriott which was very nice. We bought snacks and souvenirs in the Market store which helped on the food expense. We enjoyed several nights of snacks and wine in the room while enjoying the view and ocean breezes.We did attend the Hilton luau and had a very fun evening. The sunset from the point where KPC is located is breathtaking and not to be missed.We visited the Marriott, Mauna Kea and Fairmont Orchid while on the island and I would choose the Hilton Waikoloa for a return visit.I cannot really comment on the food as we did not eat in any of the restaurants. The coffee was 3.50 a cup at the coffee shop which I thought ridiculous. I did not know the trick about your in-room cup and fill for less.We were invited to the manager's reception since I am a Diamond Hilton Honors member and could not have had a more welcome feeling from that group. All of the top managers were there and visited every table and chatted while being really interested in the guest feedback. The drinks and puu puu's were good and the music was great.We had a very memorable vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa and would return. It was a special time for my Mother and me that we will always treasure. ", " Short Review: it's a great resort, stunning pools, amazing grounds - breathtaking views everywhere you look. Long walks to get around, don't be in a hurry. Pools are not heated (but this is Hawaii). Overall - Great Value for Money - one of the finest hotels I've ever stayed at. Going to the Big Island - stay here - it's great.Long Review: Ok look - I travel a lot - I have top-tier status with Hiltons loyalty program. This is my 9th stay at this property in 15 years. I know the property - I've seen a lot of changes. It's better than ever right now.The GM here I *think* has had to make some tough decisions - travel bugets are down everywhere and these hotels are feeling the pinch - most hotels are looking and acting shabby....NOT the Hilton Waikoloa - it really is looking better than ever. I assume closing down 2 of the resturants was one of those tough decisions.Anyway - I digress - the review:1. Checkin - smooth, painless - exactly as expected with one exception they upgraded me from a small garden view room to a full suite with incredible views. I got really lucky on this one - but it's nice to know that you have a shot at an upgrade. Plenty of properties never upgrade anyone to encourage people to book the more expensive rooms. So it's a lottery ticket - can't complain if you don't win and it's nice to know there's a chance.2. Room - OMG - the remodel is awesome - hardwood floor, plasma TV - great decorating and the beds and couches are wonderful. Huge improvement over years past.3. The view - from the room, from the walkways, from the pools - from anywhere - the views are to die for - once in a lifetime, straight out of a movie.4. The pools - these really are amazing - and the big water slide is 157 feet. -- if you like water - you will love the pools.5. Shop and Eat - the hotel has a shuttle that will take you 2 minutes to the kings shop or queens shops - ton's of options from great hole-in-the-wall noodle shops to Roy's.6. Real Beach - Hotel Valet guys will run you and yours 1 minute up to the mariott beach and pick you back up again with a moments notice. Love the valet guys (and being that this is America - you need to tip these guys - $2 per person minimum without bags)7. Special Note: These valet guys will also pick you up if you end up having a late supper and leave Roy's past 10 (when the shuttle stops).8. Staff - Incredible - maids are steller, worked around me and my crazy schedule and mess (again - this is America - Tip the maid - $5/day or $3/per person per day).9. Spa - I could live in the spa - love the spa, love the tennis pro (Joe - guy is amazing with kids). Love the golf, love the trails - can rent bikes, can rent anything...just a crazy wonderful place.Get the picture? I love this resort. I've been there 9 times - you got a question - ask me. I really love this place. They treat you like a king - best place we've been yet on vacation. ", " This was our first vacation to Hawaii, I had read all of the reviews for the Hilton Waikoloa Village, both negative and positive and I was quite apprehensive about going due to negatives such as cockroaches, expensive, nickel and dimeing you, unfriendly staff, dated rooms etc. Lets clear up the negatives: cockroaches are tropical and can be expected in most parts of the civilized world however, only one was found in our room and he was half dead from the spraying they do regularly. Expensive, not really, you are at a Hilton luxury hotel, shop elsewhere for your doo- dads these are expensive in this hotel but having gone to other hotels during our visit the Hilton was no more expensive than anywhere else. Do they go after every penny, you bet, but not in a crude manner just the manner of any luxury hotel for tourists.Staff: I can\u2019t say enough about the staff, unlike other negative reviews we did not experience any rude staff but what we did find was the staff was very attentive, very informative, greets you with a smile and have a Great Spirit and Aloha attitude. Our thanks go out to all of you especially the valets who always greeted you with a smile and made you feel welcome.Grounds: There is not too much I can say about the grounds except \u201cWOW\u201d. You will not be disappointed with the property; they even power sweep the paving stones twice a day. This place is a true garden with peace and serenity built in.Food service: I did not find it expensive for the class of hotel we were in with the exception of breakfast, great layout but highly overpriced, $70.00 for two, give me a break. Remember, you are at a Hilton hotel not the Ramada, if cheap is what you are looking for you are in the wrong hotel and the wrong Island. This being said, I personally don\u2019t find $40.00 a person for a great steak dinner to be overly priced and with drinks a great night out will cost about $100 - $130.00 for two. Service was great everywhere, especially the Lagoon grill overlooking the Dolphins. Try the burger, the best I\u2019ve had at any hotel.Lagoon Area: They added several of the paddle surfboards that are kind of fun. Go early 9 to noon so the natural sand is not too disturbed and visibility is great. There are many fish to see from Manta\u2019s to Barracuda, all harmless, but the greatest sight of all was swimming with the green turtles in the Lagoon. The equipment they rent is very dated and needs upgrading so bring your own, or rent the equipment at the Queen\u2019s Market shop (where the scooter rentals are) for $25.00 a week. Another Option is to get a \u201cResort Card\u201d for $4.50 day. This Card will pay for you\u2019re in room coffee, $25.00 credit a day at the Lagoon for rentals and many other discounts, well worth the price. Our room: It was a bit dated and most notable in the bathroom and the wall paper, however, It was well taken care off, no ratty furniture, new \u201cserenity\u201d bed\u2019s (very nice touch) an old CRT TV not flat screen LCD but the furniture was not damaged and not really showing it\u2019s age, great room for the amount of time you will spend in it. We were fortunate enough (thanks to an upgrade courtesy of Leanne Pletcher) to have a room overlooking the Dolphin Pool with views of the ocean. What can I say, the Dolphins are a definite mood enhancer and watching them every morning and night was indescribable. Birds: Many people complained about the birds making noise (they are Mynah Birds) every morning and night, I am sorry but I cannot feel sorry for you, you are in a tropical paradise, birds are part of the program, at least you know you are alive when you hear them and unless you leave your door open at night they will not disturb you and if they do\u2026..you are fortunate enough to hear them, some people don\u2019t have a toilet or shoes. Speaking of Coffee: the only way to describe the in room coffee is\u2026. Well\u2026 hmmm\u2026 just this side of toilet water, warm urine nothing but pure unadulterated swill. If you take your in room mug or your own coffee mug to the coffee bars they will refill you for $1.50 instead of the $4.00 they normally charge, if you do order in their cup keep the cup and the refill will be $1.50 and yes it is 100% Kona coffee or a blend if you prefer. Tram: New Trams and on time. But did you really take a vacation not to walk and sit around all day. The walk anywhere on the property is \u201cgorgeous\u201d and from anywhere on the complex you are no more than 10 minutes walk to the lobby or your car. There is no beach on site: however Hapuna Beach is just six miles north and repeatedly listed in the top ten American beaches. A-bay is a short walk down the road and it too is listed as one of the great beaches of the world. On the topic of Beaches, I did note some of the complaints about the hotel having no beach, if you did some homework before you came you would have known there is no beach but again, within \u00bd mile is a world class beach with coral for snorkeling and rental equipment (it is next to the Marriott Hotel). The hotel supplies transportation to A-Bay and other nearby items of interest, take advantage of this service. Also the many pools and waterfalls and the Lagoon are magnificent and warm, regardless of what anyone else says, the pools are warmer than the ocean but no one complains the ocean should be heated or is too cold.The only complaint about this hotel was mentioned earlier, the in room coffee, I hope someone reads this and puts real local coffee (Kona is authentic) in the rooms, don\u2019t cheap out.This hotel is for everyone, great staff, great service, great hotel. ", " This place had it all!!! Great rooms, Great views, Great food. And most excellant relaxation!! ", " My husband and I typically stay at condos when traveling to Hawaii, but we had free nights with Hilton so we decided to try this place out. This hotel is like no other. It is HUGE! You have to take a tram or a boat to get to your room and to the restaurants. Everything is beautifully landscaped and decorated. The rooms were VERY clean and very upscale.There are several pools with waterfalls and grottos to play in. There are a couple of great restaurants. Imari's was our favorite. We ate there on the last day and we wished we had eaten there more than once. Kamuela Provision Company was ok, but we would be willing to give it another shot. The help desk at the hotel was very friendly. The only complaints we can think of... the drinks at the pool bar were ridiculously expensive and very weak with the alcohol. Not many rooms have a great ocean view. Overall, we would definitely stay there again. ", " We stayed at the Hilton for honeymoon in January. This was an experience that we will always remember. We got upgraded to the ocean towers and had a beautiful room overlooking the golf course and ocean. We were able to open the doors to our patio and and have Ocean breeze wake us up every morning.This is a very large hotel and it does take time to get from one end to the other. The monorails and boat system are somewhat slow to get you around the grounds. However with a little timely planning and some good legs you can walk anywhere on the property. This is an absolutely gorgeous property with his own lagoon, ocean golf course, and beautiful views out to the ocean.We only ate one meal at the hotel at KPC restaurant. We had a great dinner overlooking the ocean and a beautiful sunset. The food was a bit pricey but the view made it worth it. The hotel convenient to get into many of the islands tourist designations.We would highly recommend this hotel two others are thinking about traveling to the Big Island. ", " Stayed here 15 years ago with our very young children we returned to show our now teenagers and we were not dissappointed. This resort is in Great condition and the staff were fantastic. ", " Before selecting this hotel I read reviews from other people posted on this site and others like it. Ultimately I chose this hotel because it looked beautiful, was in a location I wanted to go to, and seemed to be a good value. We were not let down.Thinking back to the comments in the negative reviews made me realize how different people are. Some people complain about the distance...how spread out the property is and how long it takes to walk/take the tram, etc. Uhhh - not that big of a deal. We only took the train once when we had all our luggage and leaving to go home. Instead we walked everywhere. people who complained about the walk must not be taking the short cuts along the ocean. Sure, if you stick to the \"inside\" of the resort it's a fair walk, but we used the outdoor paths and were rewarded with beautiful scenery and views as well as quick access to the rest of the resort.As far as the people complaining about the birds waking them up...well our experience was this only happening in the morning, when we were ready to get up and attack the day! Others complain about the cost of everything...well, this IS Hawaii and most everything is more expensive in the state. Plus, hotels are always more expensive then other places so you really SHOULD plan on paying more, and if you are not ready, then go somewhere else like Florida or stay at a run down resort in Hawaii.We played golf at Waikoloa Resort (the beach course) twice on our trip. Great staff, lots of fun. It's not a championship course by any means, but it was nice to get out and play.We went on the Ocean Sports Snorkel Sail and picnic. Awesome staff and group. Had a whale breach 200 yards or so from us. The guides were tremendous help.Did the Legends of the pacific luau at the resort. It was nice, but i wouldn't do it again. Kind of a one time thing - if you've never been to Hawaii you \"gotta do it.\"One day we enjoyed the pools and Lagoon/bay. The pools are well designed and lot of fun - thought the pool water is a bit on the cool side for our taste. No big deal though. We rented some snorkel gear at the Ocean Sports shop right there on the beach/lagoon and enjoyed checking out the underwater treasures in the lagoon as well as ventured out into the ocean/bay for some adventuring. Certainly we had a blast at the resort, but we also rented a Jeep for one day and toured the island. That was a blast. We used the onsite Budget car rental at the hotel and it was smooth and easy. This made for a good balance of taking advantage of the resort and activities around it vs. getting out and seeing the rest of the island.All in all, the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Jessica at the Malolo bar in the hotel was a friendly face we enjoyed seeing and gave us great reco's on where to go adventuring. Other staff were so helpful, including giving us a 6pm check out time since our flight out was at 10:30 at night.Food was pretty good, but we didn't eat too many meals at the resort. We had a nice dinner at \"KPC\" during sunset. Sure it was higher in price that some other places but it was a great experience. Also ate at \"imari\" (the Japanese restaurant on the property) and that scored an \"OK\" in our book (not amazing, but fun anyway). Regarding food, here's a good tip for saving money: Breakfast at \"Lagoon Spoon.\" It's right there on the property and they serve cereals, breakfast sandwiches and juice. it's just breakfast so there is no reason, in our opinion, to go spend 30 bucks on a buffet (which the Hilton offers if you are into that sort of thing). I highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa if you aren't uptight and cranky. If you like to get up with the sun (which you most likely will if you are coming from the mainland due to the time difference), walk along the ocean, understand that things cost more at a hotel/resort in Hawaii, enjoy meeting people, and generally like to have fun then this is a good deal for you. ", " I must've spent hours reading through these posts to confirm what to expect with my HHonors reward stay. Thought I would share my experience for those Diamond members like me...- I checked in at 9pm due to a late flight from the mainland, and was given an upgrade to the best available room. I was given the choice between a Deluxe Ocean View in the Lagoon or Ocean towers. Walking was not a big deal for either, but we chose the Lagoon since it was closer to self-parking.- I stayed two nights and was given four $10 certificates since there is no Honors reception/breakfast. We used two for coffee & muffins one morning and two for drinks the next night. No problems at all.- Bed was comfy, room was clean and fresh, birds were present but we were up before they were!Overall, the resort was very beautiful and we're glad we used some points to see it. We walked around the grounds in the evening, but did not use any of their pools/restaurants/facilities. It was just a base for our explorations in the Kohala area of northwest Big Island. ", " So relaxing and wonderful to have everything all with in your finger tips. The view is wonderful and the hotel staff was excellent. ", " After reading some negative reviews from other Diamond members I was more than a bit concerned about the six night stay I had booked for Christmas week. Our arrival was smooth and front desk staff was fantastic. We had a room in the Ocean Tower with an ocean view that was very suitable, clean and well appointed. There has been a lot said about the HHonors \"coupons\" in other posts....frankly, they work very well. The water coupons can simply be left in the room in place of the bottled Fiji water. Yes, there is no free breakfast, remember this IS a resort and is not catering to the daily business traveler. As compensation for this, I was provided $10.00 coupons per person, per day for use in any resort dining establishment at any time. Look past the no free breakfast and rationalize a $120.00 discount on your food bill....it really is a good alternative! I can not say enough about the staff, everyone we encountered enganged us with a greeting and went out of their way to assure we had a great stay. A lot has been said about the time needed to walk to or from parking or the lobby. Remember you are on vacation and have come here to enjoy the outdoors and beauty Hawaii has to offer. Enjoy the moderate walk because you will miss that leisure time once you return home. I echo the comments of all those that have reported on the beautiful and immaculate grounds. This is a \"must see\" Hilton property. ", " This place is really terrific. We found it easy to stay on the resort for the whole day a couple days. The lagoon snorkeling is decent for fish. The pools and waterslides are great even for adults. We had a room overlooking the dolphin pool and the bay/ocean in Lagoon Tower. Highly recommend Lagoon Tower as it is close to everything. Room rate was very reasonable for a first class resort. It is the best resort we have ever stayed at and we have been to Tahiti, Heron Island, Caymans etc. Tips : Eat at Kamuela Provision Company for a romantic sunset dinner on the edge of the ocean. Good food and real beauty. Hike with Hawaiin Walkways, a small personable group that goes on the rim of Waipio and other places. Snorkel Cook Monument with Fair Winds II. It really was a whale watching and excellent coral experience. Sure the Waikoloa Hilton is big , and they have that $10 coupon policy for Honors members, but we ate breakfast on our lanai watching the dolphins play and then used our coupons toward eating at KPC and it worked out great. Highly recommend it as a first time visitor to Waikoloa, but have been to Hawaii about 20 times and this was the best experience ever. ", " Many a reviewer has commented on the scope of this property and somehow it didn't sink in until I saw it myself. Wow! This is quite an impressive hotel with something for every member of the family to enjoy. From the birds on their perches in the reception area, to the giant statues of Buddah and the fabulous landscaping around their lagoon, the property planners have created a a world that is mesmerizing. The check-in went smoothly and we were given a map and pointed in the direction of our room. We were able to find it, but I would HIGHLY suggest that the hotel have staff lead people to their rooms along an easy path - especially if they see that some in the group are elderly. The first time you try to find your room it can be confusing (heck, the FIFTH time you try can be too) so it would be nice not to have to walk too far out of your way as you try, given the distances in doing so. We never found any good solutions for the number of steps from our hotel (lagoon tower) to the pool. We had two older parents with us and the walking involved was strenuous (and poorly lit at night) so that they never did see the entire property as it would have exhausted them to try. That said, I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel t o families without older parents or mobility issues.We took the advice of a trip advisor member and booked out rooms in the lagoon tower. We couldn't have been more pleased. My parents had an ocean view farther away from the dolphins and it was picture perfect. My husband and I were down the hall and had an ocean view with a view of the dolphin pool as well. We really liked being able to watch the dolphins swimming around under us! The room was attractive and well appointed and the bed placement allowed you to look right out at your view while resting. It was fabulous- as were the mattress and pillows. We all slept like babies! There was even a walk-in closet.The grounds were immaculate and interesting. The pool areas had waterfalls and caves and bridges and plenty of hot tubs around every corner. The massage cabana seemed to be ridiculously close to a well walked path so I might suggest having your oceanside massage early in the day when very few people are out walking yet. The path to A beach is very rough and rocky so either wear good hiking shoes for it or take the complimentary shuttle. The lagoon is also a great place to play. My husband and I rented two kayaks and paddled around the lagoon. This was great fun and allowed us to get right under the waterfall. We could also see many large sea turtles swimming around our kayaks (which the snorkelers were greatly enjoying.) The breakfast buffet was very good and had tables overlooking the lagoon and waterfall. We ate dinner in the Malolo lounge which had a nice outdoor space. The menu was a bit limited, but the meal was good.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for anyone with small kids or teens, or multigenerational groups. ", " Bought the 5 nights package thru Costco travel which includes, free breakfast for two, free internet, drinks for two, two round at putting green, 50% discount on water sports and other free goodies. Throughly enjoyed the days and value for the money in every aspect. The moment we walked in we got a free upgrade to Lagoon tower upgrade by simply requesting with a smile. Friendly and lively staff. Hotel has multiple restaurants but mostly expensive and a nearby food court at Queen's marketplace comes in handy. Buffet breakfast (served at BigIsland hall) gets high marks. You can simply spend two or three days within the resort without taking a step outside but we spent a lot driving around the big island. Lot of antique, cultural art work all around the property. We love the environment - sea fed lagoon for snorkeling, numerous fresh water pools, waterfalls, slides and so on. The resort is so huge and you can do a lot to kill your time. Some architectural aspect of this resort is nice- you will be amazed to see the tall columns of the grand staircase ", " Wonderful spot for a family vacation. The rooms were clean and spacious and the resort was wonderful. My children loved the boats and monorail and according to them the slide was awesome it made you feel like you were somewhere special.  There were only two negatives about the resort we stayed in the ocean tower and the noise from the birds drove us nuts and woke us well before people on holidays want to get up. The other problem was the welcome gift that was left on the childrens beds had to be paid for. The grounds were perfect and beautiful. I am so glad that we decided to go the big island as well as Waikiki. It was what I imagined Hawaii to be. The kings and queensmarket place shops were very useful and could be travelled to by a shuttle. We loved it here and next time would skip Maui and spend the extra time on the big island. Its hard to please 6 people but this place did. If you get a chance take a tour with Mauna Kea Summit Adventures my husband and two teenager children raved about it. I spent that time in the pools and having dinner by the dolphins with our two youngest and felt perfectly safe and happy. Our family had a fantastic feeling of peacefulness here. ", " This was our 1st time visiting the Hilton Waikoloa and it is the best! It is a beautiful hotel with lots to do. Every where we went we were greeted with a smile and \"Aloha\". The best part of our stay that will stay with my husband and I was our experience with Jessica from room service. Jessica is truly AMAZING!!! Our first night there we decided to order room service and met her. When Jessica got to our room she was so proffesional and courteous. We told her we had just arrived as she was setting up our dinner on our table and she mentioned to us we definitely should have breakfast at waters edge (we went and loved it!). We asked her questions about the island, where to go, what we \"must see\"...She was just such joy. I wanted to talk with her more but I knew she had to get back to work. A couple nights later we decided to order room service again. When we called Jessica answered the phone! Apparently she does 2 jobs which is great! After we placed our order she asked if we would be needing extra ketchup because she remembered the last time we requested alot. I was so surprised that she remembered us, it made us feel like we weren't just \"there\". I could go on and on! If you do decide to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa and get the pleasure of meeting Jessica, you will not be disappointed and please tell her that her friends from reno said ALOHA!!!! ", " Swim with the Dolphin Experience, Hawaiiin Beach front resort with a Private Lagoon. Family Friendly. Conference Center, Water Taxis between hotel buildings, Disney like tram between buildings, ", " We stayed here just before the Christmas holiday and really enjoyed ourselves here. We stayed here 3 nights after staying in Maui for 10 nights. We were sorry we did not stay here longer. Getting to the hotel is easy- only 20min drive to the hotel. The airport is so small, getting in and out is so easy!Check-in was also very easy and took 5 mins. We had an oceaview AND Dolphin lagoon view room on the 4th floor of the Lagoon Tower. My three year old son and I just loved hanging out on our balcony watching the dolphins play! The pools are really nice- for those of you with small children, you will love the pool section with the sandy beach. The water came up to my son's waist only and he loved playing in the water. Also, next to the sandy pool, is a water fountain that sprouts water from the floor that the kids loved.The pool I highly recommend for those of you with young children is near the Ocean Tower section of the resort. There were small/kiddie sized waterslides there where you could spend your entire day. My three year old had no problem going down the slide by himself. You must go there- such a blast!!! One other thing we enjoyed about the hotel was the great service- you always bumped into someone who asked you if they could help you find a part of the resort or any other general question. We enjoyed eating at the resort - Lagoon Grill was our favorite- most nights they have a dinner special and you can get 50% off your bill if you are there before 6pm to eat. Breakfast at Water's Edge was good- the made to order omelets were great and they had good selection of eggs, fruits, cereals, etc (even small smoothies). During the day, the Orchid Marketplace was good for things like hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, sushi, and panini sandwiches.Housekeeping gave us extra towels without us asking and also kept the room so clean and well stocked with the shampoo and conditioners from the spa (coco-mango). We went to see the volcano by driving to the Hilo airport (1 hr 45 mins) and your must go with Blue Hawaii Helicopters! What an experience... Also, there is a macademia nut factory nearby about 25 min drive from the hotel that we enjoyed- the concierge had some info about that. It beats the drive to the other side of the island to the Mauna Loa one. So, like other reviews note- the resort is huge and on 62 acres. The train and boat come every 5 minutes and that was never a problem for us. There is a $15 per day self park fee at the hotel. If I had one negative to say, it is that the pools are ice cold- it takes time to get used to the pools. You NEVER see anyone in the pool until the hot sun comes up around noon. Otherwise, we really loved this place and will go back next time we are in Hawaii. ", " It had been two years since our last stay and when I reviewed the resort in Dec of 2007. Since my last review I have noticed several improvements:Staff: A much better attitude overall. In speaking with an employee who we have grown to know during our four visits over the last eight years, he remarked that there was a well needed management change that created much more of a focus and a more positive atmosphere. Everyone we encountered was quite friendly and actually seemed pleased to serve.Grounds: The renovation of the dolphin area is completed and this place is the cleanest that I have seen it. Twice in the early morning, I witnessed staff using a power floor cleaner on the paver stone walk ways. The spa/locker rooms are remodeled.Food service: -Yeah, I know, it's expensive. Welcome to Hawai'i... However, they did add some options to take the bite off of families through the addition of a cereal bar open in the AM next to the dolphin pond and kiddie lunches at the grill. Also, the italian restaurant is open and renamed during busy periods serving more modestly priced dinners (think Olive Garden.)Lagoon Area: Again the waterfront staff seems to have undergone an amazing attitude improvement; they used to be kind of nasty and now they are fun. They added several of the paddle surf boards that are kind of fun.Tram: Brand new trains!! They have three, two in service and one backup. Best of all they were working the entire time we were there!!For the many folks who are here via HHonors Diamond 175K Award, the free breakfast bar in the Ocean tower is closed and I say 'good riddance.' The place was inconvienent for those in Lagoon or Palace towers, crowded and you don't have to guard a stale dry muffin from the flocks of birds. The best part is that it was replaced by $10 chits (coupons $10/night X 2 for double occ.) meaning that you have $20/ day per room to spend whereever you'd like. While this doesn't cover a full breakfast, it does cover some food, drinks at most bars, coffee etc. It is not nearly as complicated as one previous reviewer remarked. Just read the coupon for where it can be used and pretend it's a $10 bill. The water bottle coupons are just as simple: There are two bottles of hideously overprice Fiji water in your room, take a bottle, leave a coupon and it's all good. Two bottles per day per room. Also to my fellow diamond friends, room upgrades are much easier if you are a friendly, charming guest who would be willing to provide the front desk clerk with a small token of appreciation. $20 got us an upgrade to an ocean facing 2 room suite in Palace. (Just please be discrete, check out a website called \"thetwentydollartrick\" ) A small price to pay for a very nice room for six nights.We were there before Christmas and it was kind of quiet. The Ocean tower restaurant was closed as was the Italian place. As we got closer to the holiday, they opened the italian place, added a few more taxi boats that matched the occupancy of the hotel. Again, this just seems like smart management.Some of our favorite things to do... Happy hour on the boats: We mix up a cocktail or two and ride the boats for a couple of laps, nice and relaxing. Sunset at Buddah Point: uncap a bottle of vino and enjoy the show that God puts on every night. Time your visit around sunset and you'll get to see the final stop on the tiki-torch lighter's run. Lagoon: This is the best chance you'll have to snorkle up close and personal with turtles as well as some tropical fish. Go early in the morning before the kiddies get the water all stirred up and murky. Boatlanding Pavillion: On the weekends they have live guitar music and some very good sushi.There is no beach on site, however Hapuna Beach is just six miles north and repeatedly listed in the top ten American beaches.This is a great hotel for kids young and old, romantic couples and anyone with a sense of fun. Not a good place for people who don't like to walk, don't have money, are freaked out by dolphins or are expecting a Four Seasons level of resort. ", " Great great great hotel... just expensive (that's why we went just before Christmas new years... specially the restaurants... there is a food court close by--eat there! You really can't go wrong staying here we had an amazing time. ", " We had a great experience over the 5 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village property, but probably one of the most gratifying experiences was an employee who went out of his way to serve us. Romulo was on duty when we arrived a few minutes after 11:00 AM, the posted end time for the breakfast. Hey, what I can say, we were there on our Honeymoon?! Anyway, when we asked if we could still eat, all the 5 servers who were still there looked at each other and said \"who's gonna stay to serve them?\" Romulo immediately said \"I'll stay\" and made sure we got fresh hot coffee and stayed till we were done. Sounds like a small thing, but he didn't have to do it and he made our experience at the Hilton flawless! Thanks Romulo! ", " My family and I stayed at this resort on June 3rd thru June 12th. This is one of the best resorts in which we have ever stayed. The sheer size of the resort is breathtaking. The property is extremely beautiful and is very impressive. The employees at the Hilton were always very kind and courteous and were always willing to help when asked. We stayed at the Ocean Tower and our room was nice and quiet. Next time I would probably want to stay at the Lagoon Tower just because of it's proximity to the main lobby. We didn't mind the long walk between our room and the main lobby in the morning, but at the end of our day it did get somewhat tiring knowing that once we arrived at the hotel that we still had a 10 minute walk to get to our room. As others have mentioned, there is a train and also boats that will take you back and forth, but you usually have to wait for a few minutes for it to arrive at the main lobby, which just adds to the time it takes to get back to the room. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a partial ocean view room which was a nice surprise. Our room was very nice and had a great view of the ocean and the golf course. It was very relaxing in the mornings to sit on the balcony and listen to the tropical birds sing while watching pods of spinner dolphins swim down the coast.Since I am a Hilton Gold member, the front desk also gave us several $10 gift certificates that could be used for food at the hotel. We used these for lunch during the days we elected to remain at the resort which worked out well. The cost of dinner at the hotel is extremely high, so we decided to eat elsewhere for dinner each night.My family and I really enjoyed our stay at this property and can't wait to return. We could have stayed here forever. It definitely exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend this property. ", " It's big, so if you don't care for big resorts than this might not be the place for you. They have a bullet train and a boat system that runs through the property taking you from location to location. When you step out the front lobby of your particular building you can't see the others, you either have to walk or take the transportation system to get around and see the entire resort.Resort: In a word - NICE. Another word - CLEAN. Another - PRETTY. You already heard the BIG word.- We heard people talking about the prices at the on-site restaurants. We never ate at the resort for dinner. We did go to the buffet for breakfast, which was very nice. It cost about $65 for two adults and a child. Anything you could want for brunch, EXCEPT no smoked salmon, capers, and chopped red onion. I was disappointed by that, but it must be too \"European\" for all those Japanese people I guess. :)- There are a couple of shopping centers in driving distance (or a 15 minute walk if you're up to it). There's a Macaroni Grill, a Japanese place, and a Roy's. Look Roy's up on Google - they are mainly in FL and CA (and they have one place in Buckhead GA too). Check them out. $200 total for two adults and a child. Nice upscale dinner. Some desserts take 1/2 hour to make, so you'll be ordering it at the same time you order everything else. Plan on $50 - $70 per person for the whole shebang. Plus, a $30 - $40 tip. - Dolphin Quest: $200, but a wonderful experience for your child. You might say \"no\" now, but when you get there you'll change your mind. Plan for it. ($200 and UP per person)- The disappointment: This area (Waikoloa) is NOT tropical. You'll see when you get there. You'll go for a 17 mile drive north from the airport (Kona) and it's entirely flat, black, lava rock until to get to your destination. You'll wonder just what the heck you got yourself into until you get there. (You'll like it and want to go back) :)- We were told that Hilo is the picturesque Hawaii, but its 100 miles away. Like most places, it's mainly Japanese, which fits us just fine since my wife is Asian. - There's no beach here, just lava rock extending into the water. If you see a picture of a beach at the resort it's a small man-made area made primarily for snorkeling.- One more thing, the resort, along with the neighboring Marriott seems to be located in a residential area of gated communities and villas. Two outdoor shopping malls used mainly by the residents and very safe. We were told there are only to cops on this side of the island, because there is no crime - just speeders like me. Aloha ", " This resort is like no resort I have ever seen or imagined. Everything is here. The staff is very helpful, friendly, and courteous. The natural and archetural beauty is unmatched. This resort is by far the nicest resort my wife and I have ever stayed at and we take at least four leisure trips a year together and travel at least 200 days out of the year. ", " Just got back from Hawaii this morning and miss the Hilton at Waikoloa Village already. The parents, kids and teenagers had lots of fun. The lagoon was the best. Lots of water activities to choose from. Plan on spending lots of $$. It was well worth it however. We plan on going back there this summer. ", " Great Place to be and come back over and over again! ", " I loved this resort. OK its contrived, built out of the lava fields and very Disney-esque - but what's not to love. We wallowed in it. This was my first trip for leisure in 12 months. So I left my stress on the plane as I embarked at Kona airport and jumped into a taxi to Waikoloa. We had a wonderful driver called Margaret who arranged to pick us up for our return journey as well.The check-in at the HIlton was friendly and very efficient. A short wait in the lobby for the train to take us and the bags to the room was comfortable and amusing - sipping on ice water and watching the parrots that welcome the tourists and pose for photos.We stayed in the Ocean Tower. It's at the far North end of the resort and the last train stop, but it takes about 5 mins on the train (if that). Our room was large, with a very useful closet area that helped us keep our room tidy (even with messy teenager in tow). It didn't have any premium view, but the outlook onto the golf course was fine. A large number of cats (a problem for the wildlife on this island) entertained us each morning, meowing and looking up at us in the hope of food. Obviously this strategy works on some guests.The birds were very noisy at night. But couldn't be heard with the entrance door shut. We ate in the Kirin chinese restaurant which had very good food. The resort restaurants are pricey but we didn't find it all that much cheaper to eat up in the Queens shops either (although I am sure we could have if we had gone to Denny's or somewhere like that). Also we had a problem with over-ordering and needed to adjust to the larger serving sizes. The sushi in the bar at the ocean tower was fresh and delicious and not really much dearer than if we had bought it in the ABC shop.Fruit and cereal from the gourmet markets made for good breakfasts - but note there are not plates or spoons in the rooms (we used the cups from the cold water in the lobby and spoons from Starbucks). There is also no tea in the room - an assumption that everyone drinks coffee.There is so much to do on this resort and I wish I could have stayed longer than I did (5 nights). There are a number of pools, waterslides, and spas as well as the lagoon. The lagoon is full of fish and turtles and a great, albeit tame, spot for snorkelling. And hey - tame's fine. The sunsets are spectacular and I recommend some time just lying on the beach chairs.People have complained about the size and the time to get around. I recommend walking. I enjoyed walking the resort every morning and evening, just for fun, and to get from pool to pool and place to place. I also ventured up and down the coast a little just for some more aspect and exercise. You can also walk to the Kings Shops and Queens Market - it takes about 20 minutes and is partly shaded. Or there is the shuttle which runs about every 20 minutes (1 per person, have the right money or they will pull a \"no change\" trick).We went on two adventures - to Moana Kea, and to the volcanoes. These were enjoyable and I am glad we did them but I was happy to come back to the resort for our last day of R and R. Bliss. ", " After several visits in the past 5 or 6 years , it remains our favourite! Most staff were friendly. Grounds are immaculate. IMARI Japanese restaurant: good food, attentive service. Kamuela Provision Co.: a terrible disappointment, awful hostess, average table service, OK food, excellent cheesecake but VERY EXPENSIVE, terrible value for money(their price point is very OFF for what they offer - much better value outside). Good vacation - would consider returning in the future. ", " Just returned from 8 fabulous nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Had some trepidation after reading the reviews about older, unclean rooms, but we were pleasantly surprised. Yes, the rooms, at least in the Lagoon Tower, weren't comparable to, say, the Grand Wailea or something. But then again, they were half the price. They were clean, the furnishings and beds were nice but not spectacular, and the service was great.What made the trip though was the rest of the hotel. Had a view overlooking the Dolphin Quest pool, swam in the pools and lagoon every day, saw turtles, ate in the restaurants, walked around the grounds, enjoyed the evening programs -- all in all, 11 out of 10. Kids had the time of their lives. Few caveats -- yes, the place is expensive. The breakfast buffet, while tasty, wasn't worth the $26 per person, and the dining room was sort of scruffy. Parking is $15 a day ($21 if you valet), which is a rip off. Internet access is also a rip off. Yes, the place is huge -- we stayed in the Lagoon tower (highly recommended -- close to big pool and close enough to lobby that you can walk), but the boats/tram were almost there when we needed them; no long waits like others reported. And finally, yes, you need a car -- if you stay in the resort the whole time first, you go broke from the restaurants, but second you miss all the sights and local attractions. Found several great restaurants (Hawaiian Style Cafe in Waimea was great) that only a car could get you to...All in all, it wasn't the fine luxury of the Wailea or the Fairmont, but I didn't expect or want it to be -- wanted a great family vacation for wife and the 2 and 10 year old girls, and it over-delivered in this regard. ", " Make sure you use both ends of the resort - Lagoon Tower end is busier with a massive pool system, Ocean Tower end is more peaceful (mini golf and more pools). Activities on the ocean-fed Lagoon are terrific for teenagers and little kids too.Lots of paths that are very easy to use, generally flat, but any slopes are gentle (or use the tram or boat).Coffee shops, restaurants, high-end shopping on site. Shuttle to nearby beach, shops and restaurants.Staff very friendly and efficient, resort well kept / tidy.Try a Blue Hawaiian helicopter trip over the volcanoes and east of island, ATV and horse riding at Kahua Ranch !Alamo car rental also very efficient.Remember to use sunscreen!! ", " We've stayed at this property 4 times and each time it has been great! It has everything...a great pool with waterslides, a lagoon, good restaurants, plenty of activities, etc. It is the perfect hotel to bring kids. ", " We visited here just after the resort was completed about 20 years ago and it seemed a little disneyesque. But over the intervening years, the rich volcanic soil that the resort is built on has enabled the plantings, trees, flowers, and wild life to mature. The views from virtually anywhere on the resort are spectacular. Sea turtles, tropical fish, and eels are visible from the bridge over the lagoon. The lava beaches form tiny coves ready to explore on foot. The restaurants are world class with unbelievable views, especially sunset at KPC. Even the Luau, which could easily become touristy, felt totally authentic . The resort has a resident naturalist and culturist to keep nature and Hawaiian traditions pure. Find this anywhere else in the world. ", " Stayed at the Hilton in October and had a wonderful experience. From the time I stepped out of the car to the time I left I was never treated badly and even had some surprises. I had booked a partial ocean view but I was given a deluxe ocean view in the Lagoon Tower. The front desk person was extremely helpful and friendly. This resort is very large but is still very easy to get around. You have the option to use the tram or boat which are very nice when you want to just relax on your way to your room. You can always walk everywhere but like the previous person stated - it is not always the quickest. At each tower there is a status screen that shows when the next tram and/or boat are due. There are a lot of choices for food and they can be expensive - but food is not cheap anywhere on the island. There are 3 towers with guest rooms. The Ocean Tower is the farthest from lobby. The Palace Tower is closest to the convention center. My favorite is the Logoon Tower. It is closest to the lobby, largest pool and restaurants and shopping area. The rooms are large and I was able to leave the sliding door open every night and could hear the ocean. What a nice was to wake up. Hilton places the bed at an angle and you could see the ocean from there. There are so many activities to choose from. They have several pools (including an adults only pool) and slides at the pools. They even have a sand bottom shallow pool that is great for families with small children. You can also swim and snorkel in their lagoon (which is fed directly from the ocean). Dolphin Quest is located at the hotel and it is so much fun to just watch the dolphins and their trainers. Overall this is a GREAT place to stay and relax. I will definitely be going back to the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " Hilton Waikiloa Village on the South Kohala coast, Big Island is an absolutely magical destination for relaxation as well as sightseeing. This was our first trip there but we will most certainly be going back, distance notwithstanding. The travel times are long, of course. You should plan to stay for 2 weeks, to enable you to enjoy the resort as well take in the rest of the island. It is pricey, not least the restaurantsw within the resort. One cocktail costs $12!! We mostly ate at the Food Court in Queen's Marketplace or at the King's Shops just down the road from the resort. Groceries, including alcohol, can be purchased at Island Gourmet ( Queen's Marketplace) or Whaler's General Store (King's Shops). Breakfast at the Water's Edge Restaurant in the resort is very good, but costs around $20 per head, unless you have brunch on Sundays, when it costs considerably more. Rent your car online, costs less. A 4-wheel drive is better. The Vocanoes are A Must! And, do'nt stay in Hilo - has the highest rainfall in the US!! The luau is good, average food. The pools, the Dolphin pool and the lagoon are wonderful... ", " We spent 9 days here and were never disappointed. The resort is large, beautifully landscaped and peaceful. Our room was a deluxe Ocean View King and the Lanai immediately became our favorite spot, The views were absolutely breathtaking, over the ocean and Lagoon to the Dolphin Quest lagoon area. The restaurants were very nice and no more pricey than expected. The room service and housekeeping staff were wonderful. This is a very quiet and peaceful resort with little nightlife but was just what we were looking for. We will definitely be back! ", " Well for starters I can't understand all the negative comments about this place.Yes it is large, but there website states this...so do not be surprised if you have to walk through beautifull tropical gardens for a bit longer than normal to get where you are going. Yes things are pricey....but it is a large resort....things are expensive at lamost all resorts...and if you dont want to pay...go elsewhere...don't complain.From the moment we drove up to the front we were greated with the Aloha spirit and it only got better.We had a deluxe Ocean View room in the Ocean Tower and loved it. Sat on our balcony most nights with a few quiet drinks and watched the sunset. The rooms were clean and comfortable only problem we had with them was the in room coffee/coffee maker was average at best...but that is a minor problem with a Kimo Bean coffee outlet within the tower.The canal boats and trams are slow...but you are in Hawaii...sit back and enjoy the view. And contrary to some of the other negative reviews it isnt quicker to walk unless you just missed one and had to wait the maximum of ten minutes for the next boat or tram. The time taken just gives valet enough time to get your car ready...ring before you leave your room. By the way , you will need a car...not just because the resort is isolated but because you need it to see everything the island has to offer.True it has no real beach....but the lagoon is fantastic. It is tidal and has heaps of fish of varying types and sizes. Also everymorning we saw turtles on our way to the buffet breakfast. The pools are great and were never crowded for the entire week.All in all it was a dream stay and I have and will highly reccommend it to all my family and friends.Remember turn up with the Aloha attitude and you will be given the same......bad attitudes and body language will get you know where. ", " My wife and I have stayed a few times at the Hilton Waikoloa and have enjoyed it. Our children joined us for a visit last year and absolutely loved it. They loved the setting (lagoons, pools, etc.), the nearby beaches (Hapuna rocks!), and the volcanoes. This was a great place for families. ", " I don't even know where to begin...I got married on 10/11/09 at a private beach 6 miles north of the airport, and decided (after TONS of research!) that the Hilton would be a great place for our friends and family to be based. Boy was I right!!!! We had couples, families, mothers and daughters, and singles come with us for the wedding, and it was a perfect location for everyone! We had planned tons of activities for the wedding week, including an evening in Kona, and once we got there, we scratched everything! There is absolutely no reason to leave the resort. We stayed in Ocean Tower on the fourth floor, and the views were unbelievable. Most of our guests were in Lagoon, which was great for the kids! It is steps from the biggest (and most fun) pool, plus the spa, fitness center and most of the shopping is in Lagoon. We had dinner at Imari one night, which was AMAZING. We also had poolside service at Lagoon Pool. The servers were extremely attentive, and the drinks there were so good! We also had dinner at KPC, which was also very good, and perfect for views at sunset! The ONLY complaint that I got from a couple of my family members was the layout. If you stay in Ocean Tower it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the lobby, but it had the best views. You cannot be in a hurry here, the boat and the tram take FOREVER, so I walked, and it didn't bother me one bit.. FYI if you walk the path by the water, it's a much quicker route across the property.The night that we were supposed to go into Kona for our Rehearsal dinner (which is a 20-30 minute drive by car), was the same night as the IronMan, so we cancelled our plans and did a picnic at Buddah Point at sunset, and it was BY FAR our favorite night there. It's a great place to congregate, and there were not a lot of people there. We brought our own beer and wine and snacks and everyone hung out and took pictures! We ended up going to Lagoon Grill for dinner after the sunset, and had a great time!As far as the other amenities are concerned...I ate 4 mornings at the buffet at Water's Edge, and the food was great! I normally hate buffets, but there was tons of fresh fruit, breads, and they have an omelet station. The service was not that great, and the coffee was really bad. I got my coffees every morning at the little coffee houses on the way to breakfast, and they were great.The spa was unbelievable. Get the Lomi Lomi Massage! I work in a spa, and this was for sure the best massage I have ever had. The facilities are top notch, and worth every cent. The staff was wonderful!They have a couple of resort options when you check in, one is the resort fee, which is 4.95 a day. It includes free access to the fitness center, local calls, and a $25 resort credit for non motorized equipment rental at the lagoon. The other is $22 per day and includes all of that plus internet. Parking is $15 per day to self park, and I think $24 for valet.The rooms were huge, clean and well maintained. ", " My husband and I were so impressed with this Hilton , that it doesn't EVEN compare to any other Hilton in the U.S.! It was so family-friendly (even though we didn't bring our kids). The lagoon was so impressive that you could snorkle and see beautiful fish and sea-turtles & you didn't have to leave your hotel! My husband and I swam with the Sea-Turtles! The pools were amazing and the service was impeccable! The entire scenery onto the ocean is just amazing! We ate at the resturant (Provision Co.) that overlooks the ocean so you can watch the sunset and it was just such a beautiful experience (make sure you do that)! I'm still amazed by the \"open-air\" lobby when we walked in and all the furniture that \"sits\" outside year-round! (b/c of the beautiful 85 degree weather year-round)! We stayed in the Ocean Towers , which is the \"furthest away\" from the Lobby , (so you usually have to take a Tram or Boat to get to your room----yes.....they have Trams and Boats to take you around the resort......amazing! ) , so you need to try and stay closer to the front reception. Just a warning if you do stay in the Ocean Towers, the birds sing from 5:00am-6:00am???? (and then stop)! But ,, other than that , we really enjoyed our stay and could not get over the beautiful paintings and scenery around the Hilton! It was absolutely gorgeous! We were totally impressed! ", " This hotel always amazed me from the moment I first toured it several years ago. Finally we were able to stay here. We were upgraded to a ocean view room, treated like royalty, and found the staff to be exceptionally friendly. Of course it is a large property, so be prepared to do a lot of walking or waiting for the tram, but overall it has many options for families. The new Spooner cafe was a huge hit with the kid. Shannon was a sweet, helpful person to work with. Stepanie with Grand Vacations answered many questions, and was a pleasure to talk with. We will be back next year. A little disappointed with the KPC meal, overpriced, overcooked, but beautiful view. ", " We've only just gotten home and are saving to go again next year! We stayed at Lagoon Tower, and will again, but I walked, trammed, boated to other towers and they all looked fabulous!Food was fabulous, delicious, and for a top notch local ...not overpriced.I swam with the Dolphins-super cool! I snorkled for days in the Lagoon on-site with huge sea turtles, eels, and every fish you could imagine.The hotel has a Star Gazing night opportunity on tennis courts Tuesday nights. I can't stop gushing...this is lush Hawaii/Disneyland/Marine World/Hearst Castle (see the amazing art treasures EVERYWHERE(, super pool has waterslide and water falls to swim under, DJ to dance to while IN the water...insanely wonderful...I am so sad to be home! ", " If you are looking for a resort that includes a taste of HI at a high cost..you have found it! We have spent a few vacation in HI and this was our second here (1st was honeymoon 13 yrs ago) The hilton has a ton of stuff to do within the resort you dont ever have to leave...however it will come at a price..they even charge for air to pump up floatation devices..which they will sell you at a even higher price...we hit Walmart (20 min away) which BTW has a great selection of souveniers!The room was very clean and had alot of amenties..great large cold!!! fridge and we requested a micro (@ no charge ) they have awesome big island breakfast that is like a huge brunch every day..find it included in a pkg deal from Costco or AAA etc...it is way worth it..They skimped I felt by only including 2 tickets per day even tho our resv were for 4!! Cheapo I thought however we dont need to eat like that every day so we got milk and cereal etc...and had lunch in our room every other day...dont go to closest mkt unless you want spoiled veggies and high!! cost...grocery etc...in town near Costco and Walmart Target..etc..etc.. The local Queens Mkt Mall food court was nice tho Subwway etc...etc..reasonable choices and cost..We had a 9 yr old and 5 yr old who loved the pools and lagoon as well as swim with the dolphins..if your kids are over 80 lbs be sure to hit the BIEA Zip tour 40 min away so well worth the trip and adventure..ask for Mcgee and Oliko and bring tip$ to reward them for making your day the best ever!! ", " This hotel was very nice. Very large though, and you have to take the tram or boats to the Ocean tower because it is so far away from the lobby. The Lagoon tower and the Palace tower were closer. It can take up to 20 minutes to get from the Ocean tower. I recommend not going in the summer if you do not want to have alot of children around. They have 2 waterslides that are VERY child friendly. The Lagoon tower has the bigger pool and the bigger waterslide, hence, more children. October was a very good month. Quieter and less kids, and weather about 85 degrees. A little winder in Waikoloa than Kona which is further south. The hotel has numerous pools, asian art/statues throughout the grounds, a spa, numerous waterfall,s a lagoon with all kinds of watersports. The downfall is that it is not on a sandy beach. You can walk (15 min) or drive to the Marriot which is on a nice sandy public beach with paddleboarding, snorkeling. It is a very beautiful and peaceful place. The best part is the dolphin lagoon. You can swim with the dolphins (for a heavy price) but it was worth it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is a great choice when looking for a hotel in the Waikoloa area of the Big Island. Located approx. 20 minutes north of the Kona airport makes it an easy area to stay in. The Hilton is ideal for families with children. There are 4 swimming pools on site (1 is for adults and 1 is for children) and the two biggest have fun waterslides for kids and adults alike. There is also a salt water lagoon where you can snorkel and see green sea turtles without leaving the property. There are also great beaches very close by. I only saw two drawbacks to the property. The first is that the dinner choices are limited for those on a budget (yes, I know it's the Hilton, but we tend to eat one really nice dinner during our stay and then like to be a little bit more economical for the rest). There are tons of options for lunch, but it seemed like dinner was limited to steakhouse type fare or asian. The other drawback is that it took us 10 minutes to walk from the main lobby to our room (we stayed in the Ocean Tower) so anytime we wanted to drive off property we were looking at a walk just to get to the car. There are trams and canal boats, but you sometimes have to wait about 10 minutes until one arrives and then they travel fairly slowly from point to point. Really not an issue unless you had little kids or mobility issues. I would recommend trying to stay in the Lagoon Tower. It's a little bit closer to all of the day-time attractions. ", " This is a destination vacation spot with easy access to the most popular activities. We've been here twice and continue to find the big island and Kona in particular intriguing. Like any top line hotel you won't find the cut rate extras like wiFi and free breakfast that is provided at the cheap airport hotels, but what you will find are chris-craft powerboats or a 21st century tram to take you to your room. Also included free are beach towels, lounge chairs, cabanas, and water slides on the well maintained pools. The snorkeling in the protected lagoon is as good as the ocean with sea turtles and tropical fish in a safe place where the kids can be easily watched. The on-site dolphin institute can be observed from the restaurant deck or a grassy knoll. WiFi is free in the lounge and the Lagoon Spoon is an inexpensive cereal and muffin breakfast spot. The resort is within walking distance of a big shopping center with grocery store as well as a huge public beach with turtles, sand, and coral. Travelers who enjoy a reliable recognized hotelier with a consistent reputation will be happy with the quality of the Hilton Waikoloa. The Kamuela Provision Company has the best Pacific ocean views and cuisine of any restaurant we have ever visited, and that's a lot. You have to ask for the ocean view seating when you make your reservation. At sunset it is truly amazing. ", " Reviews are correct - this hotel is huge, but incredibly beautiful as well, spreads over 60 acres, with boats and trams to take you around, although it is really not that long a walk from one area to another - 5 minutes from Lagoon tower to main lobby. Grounds are gorgeous, walkway along the ocean is beautiful especially at sunset. No beach, but saltwater lagoon area lets you swim and snorkel with the fish and if you lucky the \"honu\" (sea turtles) as well. Incredible polynesian art throughout the hotel and the walkways. Restaurant choices very limited for a hotel this size and the lower priced ones close early - grille in Lagoon Tower closed at 6pm. Other choice in the village shopping center. Some staff friendly - some not so much. Recommend you stay in Lagoon Tower - we had great view of pool and ocean. Would stay here again. ", " I went here with my parents, my wife and 9 month old daughter and we were treated really well. The rooms were fantastic, we had complete privacy, the food was excellent, and the service was super! I enjoyed the lagoon, given that the hotel does not actually have a beach, which I thought was even better since we could interact with fish and sea turtles without any of the commotion of waves. The breakfast buffet is pricey but excellent. The novelty of the in hotel tram did wear out quickly though. YOu can often walk faster to where you want to go. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for two nights at the end of a week at a private house. We were upgraded to a larger oacenview room which was fabulous as we had paid for the most basic room. We visited the Dolphin Quest program and got to hear the trainer talk in the morning before the private programs began. Both our children wanted to participate in the Dolphin Quest program but we were watching the budget so we opted for just watching the dolphins in the lagoon which we all thought was cool. The kids loved the tram and boat rides but I found them to be a little slow and preferred to walk if I was just trying to get somewhere fast, plus I really enjoyed the art collection that you can take in in the hallways while walking around. The kids and my husband did not seem very interested in the art.  The resort is so large that we did leave in our two days but if I were to stay longer I would go to the shops at Waikoloa Village to stock up on basic food items and sun tan lotion as the resort prices are higher and there is not as much of selection. I was impressed by how uncrowded it was. I was not impressed with the snorkeling lagoon as I had just spent time snorkeling in the open ocean and I found the lagoon to be murky and lacking in fish. I was also not impressed by the lack of access to a natural beach though my family really enjoyed the water slides and kiddie pool with the sandy bottom. I also recommend the daily bruch that we added as a \"bruch special\" on the website and the kids essentially ate a very good, large breakfast for free. ", " We visited with our toddler, and loved every minute of it. People say that the HHV is a zoo, and it is, complete with flamingos. The Alii'i Tower is the place to be, with a quieter pool and private deck overlooking the wide, glorious beach. The place is immaculate and the staff is friendly and attentive (though they rotate through assignments, so you won't see anyone more than once or twice). Food is expensive, but there's a grocery store a few blocks to the northwest. ", " At first sight, the Hilton Waikoloa Village may seem like a Hawaiian-version of Disney-theme park which may seem overwhelming and man-made. But really once you get past the initial first reaction and really take in the sights, it really is a fabulous spot for a one-stop vacation. The size could seem daunting, but divided into three lodging towers each with its own uniqueness and amenities (pools etc.) one never feels like it is congested or crowded wherever you go. In fact while I was there, Hewlett Packard had a special convention rewards programs for its top-employees so I was wondering if it would be a dampener on my vacation, but instead we were treated to live music to Journey and KC & The Sunshine Band (from afar) since those events were exclusively for the HP staff. But still, the hotel was courteous enough to tell the hotel guests about the fireworks display that was a treat for the HP Staff, but could also be enjoyed by others. Even without those extra bonuses, the hotel amenities are great. There's a Swim With Dolphin program where there are different packages for interactive experiences with the gorgeous and intelligent dolphins. Very positive and educational and fun. Even if you don't partake in the programs, you can still watch the dolphins swim and play from a near distance. The primary draw for me is the saltwater-fed man-made lagoon where you can snorkel to your hearts content. I've seen moray eels, green turtles, puffer fish and the really cute boxfish, tang, wrasse, butterfly fish and many other varieties of colorful tropical fish just swimming in that lagoon. It is also quite protected so you don't ever have to worry about sharks or anything! The only thing you have to watch for is the 2-person paddle boat-riders and kayakers. For the most part they stay away from snorkelers. And please do not try to touch the green turtles. They are endangered and protected species.There is also another spot where you could walk onto the rocks and try to find sea urchins and also watch waves crashing against the shore. If you are looking to swim on a beach-like setting this is not it because of the rocky jagged edges. But the lagoon area evokes a beach-like setting which is good enough for me. And I love the hammocks. If you are more adventurous, you can easily swim outside of the lagoon but at your own risk.Aside from all these water-related activities, there is miniature golf and misc. children\u2019s activities. There is a flamingo \u201chouse\u201d and other exotic birds also live here. Lush greenery and exotic plants/fruits are grown every where too.Because of the expansive resort, you feel like there there is really no need to venture out of the hotel, and it is easily accessible by train ride or the mini boats that are quite frequently running through the entire resort. There are also a lot of antiques (like terra cota horses/warriors and ornate wood carvings) and artwork to stimulate the senses. What I loved was the variety of restaurants/cafes and food stands available for different budgets as opposed to being stuck somewhere and be forced to order breakfast that cost $30 or something ridiculous like that. Basically, you could have a fancy steak or a slice of pizza. My favorite was the Italian restaurant which was right by the water. Very romantic setting. The food in general is not outstanding, but decent fare. There is a strip mall that you could take a shuttle or walk to. And there are more restaurants there too. The weather is generally very beautiful here so you are almost guaranteed sunshine almost every day. I also recommend the luau dinner experience (which ironically was the best food I had there - loved the taro bread and the local fish with ginger, mushrooms and scallions especially).I booked a room with an ocean-view, but was quite disappointed with the view which was basically a patch of ocean from afar and mostly a view of the golfing range next door. Not very exciting. But the room itself was more than decent, and I spent most of my days waking up early and leaving the room to enjoy the facilities so it really didn\u2019t quite matter. If you are lucky to score a room overlooking the Dolphin Lagoon, that would be amazing I would imagine.If you want to explore the Volcanic National Park, it is quite far from this resort. It would probably require a rental car and a whole day devoted to traveling and exploring. A small price to pay to stay at a gem of a place that meets almost every budget. Even though it caters mainly to families, couples who want a romantic getaway will find that there are adults-only pools etc.If you book ahead, there is also a slightly reduced price incentive. ", " It has now been ten years or so since we have been visiting the Waikoloa Hilton. You can get all sorts of details from their web site. All I want to include here is that the kids absolutely love it! It is our family's favorite place to stay. ", " We stayed here as the 2nd week of your honeymoon. We did not know what to expect since some of the reviews on this website make this hotel seem horrible and some make it seem great.I thought it was beautiful - the grounds, the buildings, the artwork and the pools were just beautiful. Yes, the hotel is big, but the Hitlon does not hide that fact. It is written in every piece of literature they have and on their website plenty of times. The staff was great - check in was smooth and easy. The cleaning crew was always on time and did a great job. The rooms were nice, spacious and clean. The linens were clean, the towels were fluffy and smelled good. There is a coffee maker, safe and small fridge in the room (comes in handy)Our package included free breakfast every morning, this is a $60 value!!! We also had the Aloha pass which gave us free parking and a $25 credit per day to use for snorkleing, kayaks, paddle boats, etc.... this was nice but we only used it once.There are 2 large pools, a saltwater lagoon and an adults only pool. Many options to swim and sunbathe.There are animals all over this place - exotic birds, fish, dolphins, sea turtles - sooo cool to see.We did not eat at any of the restaurants, the stores onsite were over priced, but there is an ABC Store about 1/2 mile down the road.We had a great stay at this Hilton and would be back. ", " We just spent 10 days at the Hilton Waikoloa. We were concerned about the size of the resort but we actually enjoyed the train & boat & our daily walks around the grounds. Occupancy was 40-60% while we were there so we never had a problem finding a place at the pool or the lagoon. Our room in the Ocean Tower had a wonderful view. We reserved Buddha Pt for our 10th anniversary dinner & the food, service & sunset were outstanding. We took the special on the Aloha package which gave us a credit on the beach/lagoon equipment everyday. We used it to ride the kayaks, bikes & boats in the lagoon, a great way to watch the fish & turtles. We had previously done the Dolphin Quest adventure, but we still enjoyed watching other guests enjoying their personal dolphin experience. The lomi lomi massage at the spa was wonderful as always. The Chinese restaurant was a favorite, but we had most of our dinners at local restaurants nearby. This was our first stay at the Hilton Waikoloa & we will definitely come again. ", " I read so many reviews here before going. So, I was kind of nervous about our trip. That all changed once we got there! We said this might be one of a few hotels that we would return to. It has everything here! Since we are Diamond members they moved us to a suite. There was plenty of room for me, my husband our two small children. The kids loved the pools and slides. The service was wonderful! Only advice is don't eat at the Italian buffet. It was one of the most disgusting meals we've ever eaten!! ", " The staff embody the true \"Aloha Spirit\" and treated us so wonderfully. The place is gorgeous with beautiful scenery of the ocean, gardens, dolphins, and artwork all around the property. the boat and tram take you all around the property. the best breakfast buffet was at the Water's Edge Boardroom-Big Island Breakfast. The staff provided excellent service and food was delicious! ", " My wife and I just completed a 6-night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for our 10th anniversary and were absolutely thrilled with this property. As a frequent business traveler I have stayed in numerous HHONORS hotels and this one is at the top of the list. The staff was friendly and professional, the rooms were beautiful (many have recently been refurbished), there were numerous restaurants offering a variety of excellent cuisine choices, the recreational facilities were fabulous, and the location was top notch as the HWV is only minutes from some of the best beaches in the world. The great thing about this property is that my wife and I felt like we could have either honeymooned there or brought our two young children and would have had a great experience either way. There were many secluded, romantic walks/paths on-site for couples and the fine dining that you would expect for a special trip such as an anniversary or honeymoon. Plus, even though there were plenty of kids, they were not bothering us in any way and there was even an adults-only pool. That said, we can\u2019t wait to bring our kids to the property for a top-notch family vacation. Your young kids will absolutely be enthralled by the one-of-a kind Dolphin Quest while the numerous water slides, play areas, and lagoon sports will entertain children of any age. Many folks who are heading to Hawaii for the first time think of Maui or Waikiki Beach but Kona should be at the top of the list. The Kohala resort area receives 8 inches of rain per year, is beautifully manicured, and is home to what some experts believe is the best beach in the country, Hapuna Beach. We also took on the full drive around the island to see the active Volcano, the rain forests, and Hilo (the polar opposite of Wailoloa as it receives 240 inches of rain per year). Plus, you can actually snow ski on the Big Island in the winter. I would highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa Village if you are looking for the vacation of a lifetime. This is truly a world-class property with highly professional and genuine staff. We plan to return many times, hopefully once every year or two. ", " Please stay in the lagoon tower and ask for a view of the dolphin lagoon- the dolphins are so friendly and relaxing to watch!Chinese restaurant is very good. ", " We had a wonderful experience at this resort. Staff were polite,courteous,and kind. Grounds were well groomed and immaculate. Food was delicious. (We only had the Big Island Breakfast,but other choices looked great)We traveled with our 10 year old daughter and my 67 year old dad. We all loved the boat and tram the resort provides. This is a HUGE property! We appreciated the rides! :) The valets were extremely helpful and patient. The free shuttle was nice as well.Our daughter loved the swimming pools. She especially liked the lagoon! The Lagoon Spoon was a fun place to eat breakfast too! The birds in the lobby were a whimsical touch!* My husband and dad had to seek help from the 3rd shift secuirty guard- as they were trying to get to the main lobby from our area- Ocean Tower. The guard was most helpful and assisted the duo to get to a fishing charter on time. Had it not been for the third shift desk staff,the charter trip would have been a disaster!*Rent a car to see this beautiful island!We cannot say enough great things about this resort- gorgeous views,QUIET rooms- well appointed. We cannot wait to return!This was truly a trip to paradise!Teddy Family ", " At first I did not think I was going to like the hotel because it is huge-you need to take a boat or tram to get from one place to another. However, my whole family loved the resort.The rooms were large and comfortable although not luxurious, and the grounds were amazing-with beautiful grounds and sculpture throughout.The resort also had wonderful pools with great waterslides, so we had a hard time getting our seven-year out of the water. Be prepared for ridiculously high restaurant prices that had all guests talking. We ate dinner at restaurants nearby at a lovely mall. We would return to the resort anyway- but be prepared to spend on meals. ", " We have been here twice now and would love to go back again. Everything you need is right at the hotel. The beach is man made, but perfect for kids. The beach has a lagoon that has sea turtles and fish where younger kids (our teenager liked it too) can snorkel or our son liked to ride the bicycles on water. There are a few pools to choose from. There is miniature golf, a spa, swimming with dolphins (too pricey for us), and restaurants right there at the hotel. If you walk out to the ocean when the tide has gone out, you will see all kinds of sea life in the small pools of water. My kids loved this! ", " After reading all of the negative reviews about the walking distances to hotel rooms and the parking lot, etc, we were very surprised to discover that this is all bogus and must be written by people who can't get off the couch. Yes, it is a nice walk to the rooms, down a wonderful open-air hallway filled with incredible antiques, and if you hate walking, there is a tram and a boat leaving at regular intervals along the walkway. The distance to the self-park is a 2 minute walk, if that. What is everyone talking about? i was expecting this long mile long distance, but it's RIGHT THERE! If you have bags, drive up to the lobby, drop off your bags to the many friendly fellows there and go park. Even better, get them to take your bags to your room. It only took a few minutes for them to get to our room. I've waited longer in Vegas for my bags to arrive.You CAN really get your exercise walking around this resort as it IS huge, and we were all loving it that we each lost a couple of pounds and toned up on our many excursions trotting around. We almost always skipped the tram, just because walking around here is so enjoyable. WOW! What a beautiful place. The pools are incredible, the lagoon is AWESOME, definately not \"lame\", and the grounds are meticulous and unbelievably gorgeous. We did have to change rooms upon arriving as we did end up in the Ocean Towers and the sofa bed was broken and the birds were very loud all night. However, they moved us to the Palace Towers right away with no hassle at all, and it was very quiet with a partial ocean view and full mountain view. Fabulous. The food around the resort varies in price. The Kamuela Provision Company was the most expensive, but had the best fish dinners my husband and son had ever had. Awesome sunset and watched the whales breaching in the distance. Waiters and cook bent over backwards to make our meals the way we wanted them. Kirin, the Chinese food restaurant, was the best Chinese food we all have ever had, and being from Richmond, BC, we know Chinese food. Good prices. The Japanese restaurant was pricey and just OK, but had great saki. Cocktails are pricey, but there is happy hour here and there. Lagoon Grill is very reasonable and delicious burgers. Cereal place has cheap prices with breakfast sandwiches. Prices rival good restaurants in Vegas, Whistler, Vancouver. We were surprised as we expected thru the roof prices, but they were reasonable for a world-class resort. The Kimo Bean is definately pricey and I would recommend going to the cereal place for coffee and snacks instead....cheap!Massages at the spa were fairly good. Between 8am-10am all spa services are 20% off. Go for itConcierge and Discover Hawaii hosts were excellent in providing info on whatever we needed to know. Drove to Hilo (very quick and great drive) and took Blue Hawaii helicopter to see Volcano Park. Wow! Got to see inside of crater with lava bubbling. Great pilot with lots of info and stories to tell. The Hawaii 5-0 music was pretty cool too. Took the Sunset Dinner Whale Watching tour with Ocean Sports right beside the lagoon. They were EXCELLENT. Very attentive, good food on board...loved it. Also, you can sit in the open air lobby and get free WIFI. Don't bother paying for it in your room. All in all, we would all HIGHLY recommend this resort to anyone coming to Kona. After checking out several hotels, we chose the best, for the best price. Go directly to their site and click on the Hotel/Air/Car deal for the best prices possible. I felt we got a GREAT deal. ", " My first impression was that this hotel was Disneyland if Disneyland were real. This is a hotel for people who like to be active and have loads of options. The room was nice, but we barely spent any time in it as there was so much to do. The aquatic options are wonderful. The Slide Pool was filled with grottos, waterfalls, and slides. Perfect for teens and young adults. Sort of the Spring Break pool on one side and children's sand pool on the other. The staff was really relaxed and made getting towels and wrist bands easy. The lagoon is fed by the ocean so there were fish and gentle sea turtles to look at. The Palace Pool also had a slide and was quieter and more photogenic. They also have a shuttle that takes you to A Bay where you can bring towels and snorkels and feel like you are on a coral reef. The breakfast buffet is actually too good. There was everything to be imagined and they have freshly made omelets.We booked through Pleasant Holidays that gave us a Aloha Fun Pass which made the buffet free and credit toward your kayak or fins. We selected the hotel because of the Dolphin Quest that is part of the hotel and that was just a delight. Having tropical drinks while watching dolphins frollic is a joy. I thought the hotel ended up being a wonderful bargain and the art in the corridors is breathtaking. If anything, there is so much to do, it makes it difficult to leave to enjoy the island. Be sure to go to the market and get some poki to eat at sunset on your lanai. Poki means square in hawaiian and the nearby market has 12 different selections with the tuna ones being the best. ", " Let me start out with, if you are looking for value, don't go to Hawaii. If you are looking for a romantic quiet resort, stay away from any kid friendly place. I just returned home a few hours ago from Hilton Waikoloa Village and it was one of the best surprises in my families extensive traveling experiences. Everything to keep mom and day and the kids happy. The hotel is immense, no surprise, look at the website. Do people research where they go before they book it? Any hotel with 1200 rooms, is not going to be accessible to all. Reading the reviews the are posted, if I had elderly, compromised, or handicapped travelers with me, I would surely find out if everything is close at hand. The on line map of the hotel looks like a small city. Caveat emptor. And everything in Hawaii, in and out of the hotels is expensive, especially for those who live there. Any complaints about the high internet rate I laugh at..it's ridiculously high, so bring a lap top..or blackberry, or use your cell phone. Hotels are in business to make money. The food is standard, except at the Chinese restaurant, very very good. And if you are surprised by a hotel with multiple restaurants that are all not open when you get there, SHAME ON YOU. Costs nothing to call the hotel before you get there and find these things out. Service could not have been more helpful, from getting us late checkouts, to cabs, to storage. etc. The grounds are well kept, manicured, lush, and there is a treat for the eye at every corner. How do you complain about rowdy kids at a family resort? There are places that don't allow them, or, you can fork up 800-1200.00 per night at the Four Seasons about 20 minutes away and get the solace you are looking for. Our room was spacious, clean, large, and accomodated the four of us. With a balcony. At 249.00 per night. Stop whining. I've stayed at the 1000.00 per night places and was impressed by such a large place with detail to native flora and fauna, Asian art, always a treat for the eye, some loud public areas, and quiet off the path spots with tranquility and peace. There are also two adult only quiet pools. Something for everyone, unless you are the kind of person that goes to a restaurant and tells the waiter how you want the food cooked, what ingredients you want added or not. Stay home and cook for yourself. The Hilton runs itself like a cruise ship does, and for 249.00 or more if you upgrade your rooms , per night in Hawaii, I think it's a bargain. Yes, I've stayed at hotels in all ranges, from Ritz Carltons to Four Seasons to private clubs, to Embassy suites and Holiday Inns. And, have done it globally. Most days we sat and watched green turtles and a host of Hawaiian fish swim by us, just sitting on the lawns. By the way, do all hotels have 12 dolphins who receive awesome care swim in a private lagoon in front of you while you either sit, eat, or fork up the cash and swim with them for 205.00 per person? How do the other reviewers miss that???? ", " This was our first time back to this property in six years (the last time was a poor experience which resulted in us skipping Hawaii vacations and experimenting with vacations to Florida, Mexico, and Costa Rica -- all which were excellent). When planning this year's Spring Break vacation, our nearly 13 year-old daughter implored us to go back to the HIlton Waikoloa. Honestly, I had some trepidation about doing so, especially given some of the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor. Our stay during from 3/31-4/6, significantly exceeded our expectations. Samea at check in was very friendly and professional. She confirmed room preferences and effectively worked to accommodate them. Everything about the check in process was smooth...including her callling housekeeping to open the doors to the adjoining rooms and requesting a roller bed. When we arrived at the rooms in the Palace Tower, everything was set up exactly as requested. As a Hilton HHonors Diamond member, Samea also provided me with an envelope that included coupons for all of the amenitities described on their Hilton Waikoloa website for Gold/Diamond members -- including two $10 food/beveraged discount coupons per room per night. Our family enjoyed the flexibility of being able to use these coupons at any meal and at any food/beverage venue on the property (versus being limited to a continental breakfast in one restaurant).Our two rooms were spacious, well-appointed and in excellent condition. There was lots of drawer and closet space. It was very convenient to have mini-refrigerators in the rooms.There are many different food venues on the property, and while prices at certain higher-end restaurants are high, there are a variety of choices (price ranges) and kids' menus with pricing that is not dissimilar from other hotels/restaurants. We took the advice of so many prior TripAdvisor posts and went to the gourmet grocery store in the Queens Market Place (about a mile from the hotel) -- bought breakfast bagels/muffins, bottled beverages, and sandwich fixings for our beach day trips.Overall, we had an excellent six night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. My wife and I started the trip thinking \"alright, we'll do it to make our daughter happy\" ...to \"that was such a great stay, maybe it should be number one on our list for next year!\" That will be a difficult choice since we grown so fond of vacations in Costa Rica.p.s. \"The birds\" did not bother us the way they did some reviewers. ", " 9 day stay for us as usual. We come here for the peace and serenity. I will try to address concerns from other reviews;Cost of food. Consistent with most resorts anywhere. Plan for it in your budget.Quality of food: Good to very good.Size of resort: 62 Acres. The place is big. Yes, there can be a lot of walking, but that's part of the attraction. Amazing collection of Asian art along the way, and remarkable ocean views. Otherwise take a tram or boat (these are amazing, too) from one end of the resort to the other.Ocean Tower Bird Noise: Two of my visits were in the Ocean Tower. Never had an issue. The birds start their two hour conversations at about 5AM, then again in early evening. Never loud enough to disturb. Very enjoyable, actually.Customer Service: Never had any issues.Beach Access: None. However, the Lagoon offers a relatively safe snorkeling experience, with the opportunity to see all the fish and turtles you could hope for.Hapuna Beach is only 8 minutes north of the resort, and is one of the best on the planet.Nightly Entertainment: Don't expect much other than what is offered in the Mololo Lounge. If you want night life, consider staying in Waikiki instead.Pools: Temperature of water seemed perfect to us.Remember, this resort is about peace, quiet, and down-time. ", " we stayed at this property the week leading up to July 4th weekend. We could not have been happier with the resort and staff. It did not seem to be crowded at all, even by the weekend, when more families checked in for the holiday. We had specifically requested the Lagoon Tower based on other reviews, to be close enough to central lobby and parking and not have to rely on the boat/monorail. Our room had a view of the dolphin lagoon and the ocean beyond, which was beautiful. It was spacious and included a large closet with empty fridge and in-room safe. We arrived after midnight due to a delayed flight and a staff member accompanied us to our room and provided us with complimentary water and juice, and also valet parked our car for that night at the self-parking rate, since we were so tired! With one exception, all of the staff were pleasant, friendly and eager to assist. The resort was beautiful, we found everything to be clean and well appointed. The buffet breakfast was wonderful every single day. With the exception of a couple of lunches/snacks, we did not sample the onsite restaurants, so cannot comment, but did order room service one evening and it was extremely good, served promptly and we did not find it to be overpriced. Mixed drinks by the pool, on the other hand, are definitely pricey, but that's to be expected anywhere. I cannot say enough good things about this resort; if you have a young family, you never have to leave the place, you cannot get bored, there are so many activities. ", " It's crazy to me that people actually complain about this Resort. If they did their homework before going they would know exactly what they were getting in to. We traveled there earlier this month with a 3 and 7 year old and stayed a week. Although the Resort is HUGE and there is a lot of walking, it is not a bad walk...palm trees, artwork, beach, oh yeah and you get some excercise. I would recommend going to the grocery store in Waikoloa (6 miles) or at the Queens market to stock up on food and drinks. This will save you a ton of money. Our first night there we had 2 Burgers with Potato chips, 2 Hotdogs for the kids and a beer each and it was $65 and the meal was not that great.The Lagoon is a great time and there are huge sea turtles that hang out under the Waterfall. You can swim right up to them. We did not know this until the second day .We visited the Waterfalls and the Volcano. The drive was pretty neat and took about 1 1/2 hours to get to the Waterfalls and about 2 hours to get to the volcano. I recommend that you do both in 1 day. The volcano is not much further than the Waterfalls. Do not take the south route back to the hotel, this will take you forever!!!We had a great time, the pools were great, the Luau was awesome (food not so much), the Lagoon was fun, Dolphin Quest was cool, and everyhting else...It is a magical place, and reminds you of Disney World with the tram and boats, and if you have kids between 5-15 they will love it. ", " It's a bit pricey, but a real treat! The artwork alone is worth it. ", " There were about 50 in our group and every single person had a blast at the Hilton Waikaloa. There was something for the youngest child, the teenagers, and the adults. The grounds are so beautiful; the pools and slides were awesome; the lagoon had so much activities; and there were swimming w/ the dolphins that we just watched as we ran out of time. All of the crew at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We loved riding the tram or boat to our rooms and we also loved walking the grounds too as the walk ways went over bridges, along side the lagoons and ocean. The sunsets were just breathtaking. We had so much fun. ", " in that, just like any other property that is huge and remote you might feel a bit stuck unless you have a car. Think Club Med and it's not all inclusive! I would equate it to staying on property at Disney or another destination resort..essentially everything costs bucks. Can you do it on the cheap sure!... but again if you can afford to stay here would you? Sorry to say but when I hear people complain that they spent big bucks on a room and then the $12 to access the internet is too much I laugh. Ok so truth be told I am cheap too - however you won't find me complaining. I found a great rate online and got my butt to the local cafe for breakfast and had an omelette for $8 vs. the $30 buffet at the hotel..in the morning. It's all about choices. There is a shuttle to the shops that have a food court near the hotel and the breakfast actually was pretty darn good and right next to Starbucks essentially. This truly is a world class property. I have stayed there for a week on two separate occassions and still I am in awe. The only thing close in the islands in my estimation was the former Westin Kauai Lagoons with horse drawn carriages and boats to ferry you about. I say well worth every penny. P.S. I happened to check while on property and saw a rate for two of the nights @ $129 and thought wow I hope more people get to come experience this amazing resort. ", " This is a great property to stay on the Kona side. It is large but that means there is a lot to do there. I hardly ever write reviews but felt that too many of the reviews I read dwelt too much on minor stuff and didn't really present a good overall perspective. This place has EVERYTHING, pools, dolphins, boat & kayak rentals, including a spa and fitness center (fee even to use the exercise room unless you're a Hilton Honors gold or diamond member).Here's the hotel layout for rooms: Lagoon Tower to the left as you're standing in the Lobby and facing the ocean; Palace Tower to the right and Ocean Tower further to the right past the Palace Tower. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and although it was the furthest away from the Lobby and \"main\" area I liked it - had the adult pool and Boat Landing bar/snack bar there; just as close to the beach lagoon as the other Towers.First let me address the complaints that some have made about this resort: 1) the train is slow getting from the Ocean Tower (north end) to the Lobby - yes it is slow, what do you want....a bullet train??!! The trains and boats run regularly and didn't have to wait more than 5 min the whole time we were there (you can also walk to the lobby in about the same time). It does take about 15-20 minutes to get from your Ocean Tower room to the parking lot - so what! It's Hawaii and you're on vacation - stay at the Motel 6 if you want your car right outside your room door!# 2) that there isn't a big sandy beach - they do have a large lagoon with a good beach (about 100 yards long) and it leads directly to the ocean, in fact, we snorkeled from the lagoon out to the small bay and it saw a lot of fish, couple of turtles, an eel and farther out (300 feet) but still in the bay, some very nice coral.The rooms are large and many (most in the Ocean Tower I think) have an ocean view. The Kamuela Provision Company is a great location for a restaurant - on the ocean with indoor & outdoor seating to watch the sunset; the food is expensive ($35-40 entrees) but good - what I expect for the quality of food and location (the Maui onion rings were the best I've ever had). They have live music every night in two or more of the lounges and restaurants. The slack key guitar guy I heard has won a grammy and is very good; one of the other bands was just mediocre. Only down side is that if you want to get breakfast off the hotel property is that you're going to have to go to Starbucks in the Queens Shopping Center or the Food Court; or drive about 20 miles to Kawaihae (Harbor Grill is good) or about 30 miles to Waimea.If you scuba dive there's the Blue Wilderness dive shop (Zodiac boat) in the Queens Center; also Kohala Divers out of Kawaihae is good (regular boat). Good shore dives and snorkeling in the Puako area.Overall the Hilton is a great place to stay, staff is friendly and I'd definitely stay here again. ", " i would rate this 6 star hotel with nice and clean rooms and extra ordinary VIP treatment by the staff, i would suggest you to go there to feel the VIP treatment.... a real nice big property they and it was good experience to choose from two types of conveyance to your tower from boat or tram. a good place to visit with family and friends...big nice swimming pools and nice lagoon with beautiful palm trees. a good sea view and sunset watching locations... ", " This is probably one of the most complete resorts I have stayed at. Overall we had a great stay and would stay there again. It had everything we would want in a resort except for one thing that I\u2019ll mention later.It is a quite large resort with tram and boat transportation available to get you to you desired location. Though the kids loved taking them, I found walking to be a better method of getting around. Our room had an ocean view and view of the kids pool. Upon arrival, the refrigerator wasn\u2019t working and they replaced it. Nothing to get really excited about the room; pretty typical hotel room.There is quite a lot to do within the resort. Shopping, spa, gym, pools, lagoon, golf putting course, dolphins\u2026it seemed that we could have spent our entire stay within the resort and we could have not done everything.Our package included free breakfast for 2 adults, the buffet was quite large. We had to pay for the kids portion and that ran about $12/each. After tip it was about $30. Quite expensive. I\u2019m not sure if we would have eaten there every day if we didn\u2019t have free breakfast for at least two of us.The only other restaurant we ate at was the Italian restaurant. Had a very nice meal there but a bit expensive. Other dining options are at two small shopping malls just a short car drive.The pool was great; kids pool had sand and the larger pool had a water slide. A couple of spas. One entire pool was being renovated, so you might want to inquire about to get a room closer to the open pool or you might spend a lot of time going back and forth on the tram.The lagoon was nice as well. Kayaks, paddle boats are available for rental. You can swim or snorkel in the lagoon. There are fish and a few turtles to see.I didn\u2019t go to the spa but did hit the gym a few times. Separate weights and cardo rooms. There was enough cardio equipment but the weight room had barely enough equipment. If there are more than 6-7 people in there it seems crowded.Frankly, this would be the perfect resort for my interests if it had a good beach. Though it has a nice lagoon, we ended up driving to a few other beaches (Hapuna, Waialea and Mauna Kea). If you stay here, get up early and check out the beaches; well worth the drive only a few minutes away. ", " What a fantastic hotel. We stayed here on our last week of our honeymoon after spending 1 week in Vegas. The hotel has everything, all restaurant were great and had no complaints what so ever, all staff very friendly.We had booked Room Only and Garden view, we mentioned it was our honeymoon prior to ariving to the hotel and they up graded us to a beatiful sea viem room and also included breakfast for every morning we were there. On arriving at the hotel room they had a bottle of champ on ice for us.Would recommend to anyone and also would go back! ", " After visiting all the other Hawaiian islands, my husband I decided it was time to make a trip to the Big Island with our little one. We planned it around my parents' visit and took a long weekend along the Kona coast of Hawaii, staying at the Hilton Waikoloa.First and foremost, the resort is huge. That said, Hilton has done wonders to offer convenient methods of travel, multiple pathways, and a multitude of options around the resort to accommodate any need or desire. The grounds are gorgeous, the rooms some of the largest I have seen, and the staff was beyond friendly.My family and I arrived just before check-in, but our rooms were ready and we were whisked to the Ocean Tower on the monorail. I had booked a set of garden-view rooms, but we were pleasantly surprised to see we had been upgraded to partial ocean-view! The rooms had refrigerators (a major plus when traveling with a toddler) and there was ample room for a pack'n'play, stroller, suitcases, and the myriad of equipment we had. We had adjoining rooms with my parents, but still found the walls to be thick enough to block most noise (they had our daughter one night and we didn't hear anything from her!).We spent the better part of our full-day on property wandering around the resort and testing all the pools. There are three main pool areas, one near each area of rooms, and restaurants spread throughout the grounds. We only ate breakfast at a restaurant (more on that later), but it was wonderful! **If you can get a package that includes the breakfast buffet, I recommend it!!! The price tag is shocking, but a late breakfast can hold you over through lunch until dinner.** The Ocean Tower pools are more for general splashing around and are linked together by a network of small slides. There is also an adults only pool in the OT ring, which is a great place for a late-night dip. The lagoon near the central part of the resort offers swimming, paddling, snorkeling, and other water activities. It's a great place for little ones (the shore is shallow and soft) and fun to watch the fish swim (and jump). We also took advantage of other people participating in the dolphin swims and watched the dolphins splash and play. The main pool is located near the Lagoon Tower and is both beautiful and impressive. My daughter spent a lot of time playing in the jumping water fountain and splashing in the keiki cove area of the pool, and it was nice to have so many options available to relax.One of the many reasons to stay at the resort is the food -- it looks delicious and smelled amazing every time we walked by! However, paradise is pricey, and we were looking to save some money. The Hilton seemed to anticipate this and has a shuttle that runs to King's Village and Queen's Shops about a mile away. Brand-new in the Queen's Shops is a FANTASTIC grocery store that offers a multitude of food choices (from sandwiches to pizza to sushi) and all the incidentals that TSA won't let you pack. The prices are higher than you'll find at a corner market on the mainland, but MUCH cheaper than resort prices. There are also some restaurants in the shopping centers (Roy's is AMAZING!) and the typical tourist shops. We stocked up on goodies and snacks, and bought hot sandwiches and pizza for dinner, and bought some cold sandwiches for the next day (another thumbs up for the in-room fridge). Being able to stock up and have food on hand is very convenient and makes it easier to splurge on a meal here or there.The most important thing I can offer from my personal experience at the Hilton Waikoloa (and Waikoloa in general) is that it was relatively vog free. As an asthmatic, I have felt the effects of vog on Oahu, and knew it would be hard to be so close to the volcanoes. Once we landed in Kona, I could feel it in my lungs, and it got worse as we drove south toward the various tourist spots. I was nervous about being able to stay on the island (it gets thicker at night), and was afraid the weekend would be ruined. Once we got to Kohala and the Waikoloa area, the vog seemed to disappear and I didn't have any problems while at the resort. The experience taught me that I may have to miss out on seeing the lava up close, but that I could still enjoy the time on island.I could go on and on, but I'm sure this is already stretching. The Hilton is an amazing facility and a great place for those who are looking to relax. We only spent a long weekend there, but I could easily see spending a week or more just enjoying all it has to offer - for couples, for families, for fun! ", " We stayed at the Waikoloa Hilton for the last 2 nights of our 8 night vacation in Hawaii. We started off in Oahu and traveled to the Big Island where we stayed the first 2 nights on the rainy/volcano side of the island. By the time we got to Waikoloa, we were ready for some sun and pool time and this Hilton exceeded our expectations. We were using Hilton Honors points so our room was free. Because we are Hilton Gold Honors members, we got a free upgrade to a suite. The suite was absolutely amazing. It did take time to get from one place to the next on the trams/boats but there are walking shortcuts to some places if you look at the maps of the property. The food was pricey but it was expensive everywhere we ate while in Hawaii (on Oahu & Big Island). My 14 and 9 year old swam with the dolphins at Dolphon Quest and thought that was the best part of the entire vacation. We would definitely return to this hotel for another vacation. ", " My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights to start our 2nd Anniversary trip. We used Hilton Honors points and were given an 8th floor partial ocean view room in the Ocean Tower. I have Gold VIP status with Hilton so we were given an upgrade on the room, $40 in meal vouchers, and free bottled water. We only paid $15/night for self parking.So with that in mind there isn't much we can complain about. We knew in advance that the size of the grounds can be a little imposing so there was no surprise there when we checked in and took a tram to the room. Thankfully we never left anything in our car or back in the room because it does take a while to get around, either by tram, boat, or on foot. We liked our room and the view from the 8th floor where we were able to see most of the grounds and some of the ocean through a palm tree outside our window. Very nice. The grounds all around the hotel were very well maintained and we went for many walks and almost went on art overdose with the amount of art pieces they have all around the resort.The room was clean and had a refrigerator which we stocked with drinks and food that we bought at Wal Mart down in Kona. Prices for food at the resort were pretty expensive. We used our vouchers for a meal at the Lagoon Grill which overlooked the Dolphin Quest pool and were able to watch and listen to the dolphins while we ate. It was around $46 for a turkey sandwich and a burger with 2 drinks so keep that in mind. But it was a pretty good meal.The highlight of the resort was the pools. When we have kids we'll bring them back here just because of the pools. There were mulitple pools by the ocean tower and a few more on the other side of the resort by the Lagoon Tower. The lagoon was swimmable and we went snorkeling there a few times but the water was pretty murky and even though we saw a few fish the visibility was pretty bad. We rented a 2 person kayak for $15 for a half hour and had a great time and saw a large group of sea turtles playing around under the waterfall. They have a lot of water toys to rent at the lagoon. A few of the downsides were that there was no beach at the hotel and that the size of the hotel makes it hard to venture out. They partially made up for the lack of a beach by the man-made lagoon, but it's hard to duplicate a nice beach and the ocean. There are some good restaurants at the King's and Queen's Marketplace nearby. We ate at Merriman's Market Cafe and had a great meal. We also went to the Macaroni Grill and a few of the places in the food court. We avoided paying the pretty steep prices for food at the hotel.Overall, this place is great for families. Every kid we saw there was pretty happy with all the pools and the waterslides and the lagoon. This place would've been my dream destination as a kid. We ended up staying at the Hapuna Beach Prince for 4 nights after staying at the Hilton and we liked that hotel better because it wasn't as big and was right on an amazing beach. But we rate this hotel pretty high for what it has to offer. It wouldn't be our choice for a second honeymoon because it lacks some of the intimacy of other hawaii hotels we've stayed at, but when we have kids it will be at the top of our list because it does have a ton to offer in that capacity. ", " My husband and I visited Hawaii for our first time in January. We spent 14 days in Hawaii between the Big Island, Maui and Oahu. This was by far the best resort we stayed at. The rooms are average (see pictures) but the overall experience was fabulous. This is definitely the kind of resort you can come to and not leave if you don't want to go out and explore. I do admit it feels a little like an adult disneyworld so know that going in. There isn't a ton of what I would call Hawaiian \"charm\" but the resort is wonderful all the same. We enjoyed sitting on our balcony in the morning and watching the sunsets in the evening. The pools were great and the grounds were beautiful. My husband and I went snorkeling in the laguna which was cool and enjoyed watching the dolphins play. But take the suggestion from all the travel guides and rent your snorkel gear from a local shop. $25 per set from the Hilton is outrageous! We ate in several of the restaurants at the resort which were all very good and convenient. Our only complaint would be there weren't many, if any, economical options for dinner within the resort. Without a car there isn't much choice within the marketplace that is walking distance from the resort. Merriman's patio was great for a casual lunch but who wants to go to Hawaii and eat at a Macaroni Grill also located at the Marketplace??? The only thing lacking at the resort is a beach on the ocean but there is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen just a few miles north, Hapuna Beach. That is a definite must in my opinion! The Kawaihae Harbor Grill several miles north of the resort was by far the best meal and best service we had our entire 2 week vacation! I had the fresh catch, mahi mahi, and I don't even like fish! We rented a car for one day and went to Hapuna Beach for the day then up to the Kawaihae Harbor Grill for dinner that evening. Overall one of our best days! ", " We stayed from May 16/09 to May23/09 in the Ocean Tower.This place really blew us away. I can't imagine why anyone would not love this hotel.Yes, it's huge, and there's a lot of walking or riding the trams/boats, but if you have done your homework you know this already. Only people with mobility issues should have any problems here. For the able-bodied, it is not a problem. Transportation was fast and pretty efficient. The grounds and public areas were absolutely beautiful. Between the art collection and the stunning landscaping, there was something to look at everywhere you went. We also appreciated the wildlife-fish, birds, turtles that were so easy to get close to.The room was great. A good size and nicely appointed . Nothing old and tired-looking. The bed and linens/pillows were heavenly. Lots of closet and drawer space. Housekeeping was always timely and attentive. The safe was free and large enough to hold all of our valuables and electronics.I usually pick my resorts for the pool. This one did not disappoint. The main pool (Kona) is enormous, the best I've ever experienced. The water was never cold, which I appreciated. Refreshing, but not a shock to the system. Beautiful waterfalls and landscaping, along with a children's sand beach area and a waterslide. My husband, who sunburns easily, appreciated the shady areas around the Kona pool. He staked out a chair in the grotto when he had enough sun. We didn't spend much time at the Kohala pool, as it seemed more geared to children, but it was beautiful too. The adult pool at the Ocean Tower was nice to get away from the crowds and noise. There were never more than a dozen people around it. It would have been nice if there was a hot tub in the area, though. This pool closed earlier than all the rest, which was a small disappointment for me. We had no problems getting lounges around any of the pools. We thought that the lagoon was lovely, and enjoyed the opportunity to snorkel right on the property. With all the watersports equipment available to rent, there was no reason to be bored. I was surprised to see that we could watch the dolphins perform from so close without having to pay an admission. You got a good look from the restaurant deck. It was great to have so many activities available without leaving the resort.The Lagoon Tower had some very nice stores. Art, jewellery, souvenirs, resortwear, shoes, etc.We enjoyed some Hawaiian music at the bar just off the lobby. The hotel provided a schedule of entertainment in the room. The food, while pricey, was better than average. We ate at most of the restaurants and found them all acceptable. We did eat off the resort most of the time because of the prices, but I think the pricing is typical of a nice resort.I would not hesitate to return to this resort. It exceeded our expectations in every way. Staff were always friendly and welcoming and responded to our every need. I can think of nothing negative to report about this resort. ", " Just spent 5 days at this hotel in May 2009. First time to this hotel, but we've been to Hawaii several times. A couple of years ago was our first stop at the Big Island and we stayed at the Four Seasons which was great -- this time we choose the Hilton because it appeared more family friendly and was less expensive.We were not disappointed at all. Yes, the resort is huge. You have to walk a bit to take it all in. However, if don't care to take it all in then just stay at your tower and enjoy the amenities there. Each has a pool. beautiful grounds, along with dining and shopping options. We stayed at the Lagoon Tower which is the most convenient, and would stay there again on a future trip. The birds are loud in the morning, but they did not wake us and the chirping lasts for less than an hour.The granduer of the grounds cannot be overstated. The lagoons are full of tropical fish, there is art everwhere and the place is immaculate. We were traveling with 2 elementary school aged children and they loved to lagoon with it's easy snorkeling and kayaking, the ability to get up close to the Dolphins, the variety of pools and slides, riding the boats, etc. The place rocks for kids.My only complaint would be the price of food/drinks -- felt a bit gouged here...more than you'd expect. We dined on property a few times and liked the Teppanyaki restaurant, but also found good options in the nearby Kings and Queens shops (there is a fantastic Mediterranean place in the former). One day we dined at the Four Seasons simply to contrast with our experience at the Hilton. The Four Seasons has more \"fit and finish\" and better golfing than the Hilton, but the Hilton wins on overall beauty, pools and lagoon (vs Kings Ponds). And it's less than half the price.Our favorite activites on the island included - - Helicopter ride with Safari Helicopters. It's the best way to see the lava flow, and Safari seemed to run a good operation.- Snorkeling at Captain Cook: We kayaked in from the nearby bay. Took about a half hour each way, but we were able to see spinner dolphins in route and got to try our hand at kayaking.- Hapuna Beach: Truly a postcard setting. Great boogie boarding beach for kids. ", " We ate at a new restaurant in the Hilton and it was amazing (Donatoni's anti pasta bar). The food, the service and location. We were lucky to meet the director of food and beverage services, which was the person that initiate the opening of this great place...... ", " We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon for a week. Everything about it was amazing. The amount of activites at the hotel alone were enough to get us through the whole week. The hotel grounds itself is a beautiful place. The artwork along the hallways is amazing. The staff are incredibly pleasant and we never felt like we were a burden. Overall we couldn't have wished for a more perfect vacation. The only thing we would have changed are the prices. ", " This is probally the best hotel I have every stayed at. Its amazing! Its huge, a great place for kids, weddings, honeymoon, or whatever. My husband and I were amazed how big the hotel was. The is a boat and tram that goes from one side of the hotel to the other. Lots of pools and a man made beach area with sea turtles and fishes. Kona is all lava rock so if you are expecting white sandy beaches you will not find it on this part of the island, however, you will not be dissapointed. There are lots of nice restaurants on site with their own unique theme. The dolphins on site are also fun to watch. Overall, this place was amazing and soooo much fun. ", " Lagoon Tower 2nd floor is most convenient and best rooms. No need for elevator, no long walks, and close to self parking thru tennis courts. unless you want to explore. the 62 acres of incredible landscape . we stayed 2 nights/3 days and enjoyed the pool (cool, but you get use to it in 3 minutes)Dolphin experience for the kids is worth the cost. Bring your own snorkel stuff and see the turtles and fish in very safe lagoon.the kids also played played the 18 hole putting coursethis place is very kid friendly and very expensive. save some $ and, buy food 8 miles east at the grocery store in waikoloa village. big bottle of rum for $20 and some juice will save you $100's. bagels $ 7 for a bag of six, or $4 each at the hilton.Bottom line, if you get a chance to take your family here....do it. ", " Drove across the island for the Journey concert and stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa. Easy check-in, nice room with comfortable bed, walk-in closet and balcony with an ocean and golf course view. Took the tram to the Palace Tower and the boat back. The pools are nice with a very fun waterslide. Lots of artwork throughout the grounds and dolphins swimming in the dolphin pool. Restaurants are a bit expensive but the food was excellent. ", " definitely not the cheapest place to stay, but truly the high-gloss disney-like fantasy experience that even the locals enjoy! favorites: taking the tram, the trolley, the boat (the kids think that these are different rides), watching the dolphins, opening my sliding door to fresh ocean breezes, early morning walks from volcano rock to sandy beaches. snorkeling right outside my hotel room and actually seeing (touching) fish and turtles, the activity credit (because the activities are really expensive)....unfavorites: $15 for a hamburger!??!?!?, dusty rooms (i know it's been low vacancy but cmon, dust the furniture once in awhile), did i mention $15 for a hamburger?, 30 minute drive to the nearest towndespite the expense, we have stayed here more than 3 times. and it always is a refreshing stay. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village has it all: large, comfortable, and reasonably priced rooms, most with magnificent ocean views; fine (though expensive) restaurants; a beautiful, lush, and dramatic setting; an array of interesting activities as well as superb facilities for those who just want to relax and unwind.The grounds are huge, and the resort offers two modes of transport from place to place: a train-shuttle and a \"boat\" that actually rides on wheels in grooves in the water. In reality, it isn't that much of a trek to walk -- as we did several times -- from the most southerly to the most northerly points (it took 20-30 minutes).The resort is decorated with many Asian antiques, even more reproductions, and many original pieces of art. The antiques are all in the covered walkways that connect the main buildings. Outdoor pieces are less impressive, but are scattered throughout the grounds.Self- and valet parking is available at $7 and $21 a day, though our \"Aloha package\" included valet parking at only $7.In addition to the two breakfast places (in the Ocean and Lagoon towers), the resort offers Chinese, Japanese, and continental-gourmet restaurants. (An Italian restaurant was closed during our stay.) The Japanese restaurant, Imari, served an outstanding shabu-shabu; the sushi bar, however, had the most limited selections we have ever encountered. As a clue to costs, a hamburger from room service -- with garnishes and fries -- cost $18.There's little shopping on-grounds, but two malls are nearby (less than a mile away on Waikoloa Beach Road). One, King's Market, sports a tiny Macy's as well as a Tiffany's, a Rolex dealer, and other classy shops. The other, Queen's Market, is more down-to-earth; it includes, however, one of the best Japanese restaurants, Sansei, we've ever dined in (with an extensive sushi selection as well as tempura and other dishes).The one drawback, for some at least, is the number of young children -- screaming, crying, running around and bumping into people. We found them at most a minor annoyance; others may not.The location is not ideal -- about a 20-minute drive from the Kona airport on Highway 19, a two-lane road that is heavily travelled and sees frequent back-ups. On the other hand, all the roads on the Big Island are beautifully maintained -- we drove all over the island -- much like most of those in California before Proposition 13 crippled state (and local) services. ", " My wife and I had a great trip. Check in was quick and they gave us all our requests even though we booked through Hotels.com. We ate mostly off site at the Queens and Kings shopping center. Loved the calamari at Island Fish & Chips, especially dipping it in their guava jelly. Both main pools are a ton of fun, we spent most of our time at the Lagoon tower pool as it had two nice hot tubs. We had a great time kayaking in their lagoon, there were at least four turtles that swam by us while we were out there. We would definitely return!! ", " My fiancee and I stayed 3 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and loved it! We had an ocean view room, and also a view of the dolphin habitat below. The buffet breakfast at the resort was fantastic and the omelette station was especially good! We did not leave the resort for our first full day in Hawaii and checked out all the pools, etc. The tram and boat service was a fun touch to the resort. I had read the TA reviews before our visit and saw how some people did not like all the walking, but we did not find it bad at all. The room was nice, bright and very clean. I think that couples with children would especially enjoy this resort with all they have to offer. ", " My wife and two kids (ages 17 and 16) just returned from 8 days on the Big Island and the Hilton Waikola.We had read reviews of the Hilton with complaints on its size and the cost for food. It is big and the food is expensive but we knew this going in. We weren't looking for a small, intimate hotel but wanted a resort such as the Hilton with tons of stuff to do so there's no complaining about the size. We were able to reign in the food costs a little by driving to the nearby Queen's Market and it's food court and restaurants. The Hilton also had a discount card available. For $29.99 we received two $10 coupons and 10% off the total bill at most of their restaurants. This paid for itself after just two days.We had a wonderful time at the Hilton. The grounds are spectacular. Our room was on the 4th floor of the Lagoon Tower and we could see the ocean, dolphin area and lagoon. We went to both the Lagoon Tower and Ocean Tower pools but preferred the Lagoon Tower pool which is larger. There was never a problem finding a chair at the pool any time of the day. We got ours early (9:00 AM) to secure a prime spot (with shade), there were always chairs available.Our room was spacious and clean. Not a hint of dirt or musty smell as some others have posted. There was a convention group there for the first couple of days and the resort was sold out but you'd never know it. We never had a problem with noise in adjoining rooms, hallways or common areas. We walked most of the time from place to place but did take the tram and boats on occasion. At each pick up/drop point there's a screen that tells you how long until the next tram/boat so we were able to decide if waiting or walking would be the quickest way to get to our destination.Yes, there is no white sand ocean side beach but that's typical of the Big Island. The lagoon does have some sand but we spent our time in chairs at the pool so no complaints about that.Food at all of the restaurants we ate at was good with the Chinese and Japanese restaurants being very good. We were disappointed that we didn't have a chance to eat the Bella Vista restaurant. This appeared to be a moderately prices Italian restaurant but it was only open Friday to Monday and we didn't know that until after we went there on a Tuesday and Wednesday and finding it closed, finally asked a concierge about its hours.Overall we had a great time. The Hilton was perfect for a family with teenagers (and kids of all ages). Plenty of things to do on property. All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. Weather, sites and facility were top notch. ", " been there several times over the years. last time was during ironman triathalon. they've got electric monorail and italian motorbots to get to all the attractions in the complex. great choices for dining from beach hamburger joint, pool bar, fancy japanese teahouse, local steakhouse and small stores to buy drinks and stuff. dolphin encounter was upgraded to give dolphins more room and privacy if they didn't want to socialize. check in is slow. rooms are heavenly! helicopter, horseback riding, rental cars can all be done from hotel. lots of places to shop or you can go to the shopping center nearby. it's got enough artwork to fill a museum and waterslides and paddleboats and a pool with a sandy beach for the little kids. locals go there for that disneyland feeling of wow! you got to see the huge statues of the chinese zodiac by the river pools. golf course and tennis courts attached. went to the luau and they were filming for the travel channel! ", " I read some of the earlier reviews on this hotel and was a little concerned due to a less than glowing review. I can't imagine what it would take to please that person that gave such a bad review. This place is fantastic. Like anything on the Islands of Hawaii, it's expensive, but you go there knowing it's expensive. The facility is very well appointed, and you can find something for everyone to be entertained by (both young and old alike). Maybe I haven't been to \"the most expensive hotels\", but I can't imagine wanting anything added to this place. The property is pretty vast in size, but there's a lot of inexpensive transportation available to take you just about anywhere you want to go in the Village area. If you need to go farther, it would be best to rent a car. Also, to see the rest of the Island would be a good idea as well. This island has a LOT to offer, so plan ahead. ", " After alot of research my initial Hotel choice was the Hapuna Prince, mainly because of the great beach nearby. My wife thought the Hilton looked better, her birthday vaca. , so fine. We chose, or I should say Amex chose, the Lagoon Tower, we chose Deluxe OceanView, #6238, Top Floor. What a great view! Ocean waves crashing on the beach(rock) a hundred yards away, and the Dolphin Quest Pools the same distance away to our right.The room had: private balcony w/ 2 chairs and table, 2 dbl beds(firm but not hard), couch,2 chairs w/ table, small walk-in closet, 1 mini-bar style refer(not stocked) and a samll reg. refer and safe, towels were thick and soft, water hot and also drinkable, coffee maker was 2 individual cup design, we called and ordered a small 4 cup reg, maker, nocharge. The complex is large but very walkable. It was a 10 min. walk to the Main Lobby and the boats and monorail were always timely if needed(10 min wait). You can walk the whole length of the interior complex( 3 towers) in 20 min's, less on the hotels perimeter path, all three Towers. Prices are high, but you can walk to the Queens or Kings Market in 15-20 min's. If you like to snorkel you'll love the lagoon, 100's of fish and 4-5 Green Sea Turtles that hang out at the falls. The water in the lagoon is great and clear near the rocky edge. The closest beach is a 20 min. coastal walk South, from Laggon Tower, bring some good running or light hiking shoes for all the lava and corral paths. The \"sandy\" beach is \"A\" Bay and there is also a Hilton Shuttle for a $1.00 when available. There is only a short trail North of the Hilton, a couple hundred yards then just unmanageable rock. If you love whale watching this is the time and the place, we saw hundreds in the week we spent here. Service was very good, food very good and the Valet's very quick. We highly reccomend and would return in a heartbeat! ", " We just returned from 15 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa (family of four - kids aged 6 and 5). We were at first a little overwhelmed with the size of the resort, but the trams, boats and walkways make it easy to get around. You quickly realize to check twice that you have everything before you leave your room as depending on where you're headed, it could take a few minutes to walk/train/boat back to your tower if you forget something. That was a minor issue though as the size of the property more than makes up for it by having room for two great pools and a spectacular lagoon. I was a little skeptical coming in about the lagoon, but the lagoon is open to the ocean and the water circulates freely and is very clear. The lagoon turned out to be a real highlight as the kids loved the soft sand, the fish and most of all, the numerous turtles that we encountered on a daily basis. You can also rent waterbikes, paddleboats, etc. at the lagoon. If you have kids, I don't think you'd find the size of the resort to be an issue as with the multiple pools and lagoon, you'll never be bored.We were in the Ocean Tower and our room was spacious and clean. If you've never been to Hawaii before, the myna birds do make a racket at sunrise/sunset, but it never posed an issue or disturbed anyone's sleep. The food on-site was very good and reasonably priced. The Japanese restaurant where the chef cooked at the table was fantastic - best meal of the trip. The four of us also had a great time at the luau (the food was surprisingly good). If you venture off-site, there are a couple excellent restaurants in the nearby mall (the Macaroni Grill and Merriman's Market Grill were our favourites).If you like swimming in the surf, the only downside to the Hilton is the lack of an immediately accessible beach open to the ocean (although the lagoon has a sandy beach that's great for little kids - no waves). A-Bay is a 5 minute shuttle ride away and is well worth the trip. We surf was tame, but it's a pretty spot with the numerous palm trees. If you have a rental car, Hapuna Beach is about a 10-15 minute drive north of the Waikoloa resort area. Hapuna is fantastic and our kids loved playing there in the bigger surf (with their lifejackets on).We stayed at the Westin on Maui last summer (Kaanapali beach) and I think we all enjoyed the Hilton more. At the Westin (a much smaller property), it was easy to switch between the pool and the beach at a moment's notice, which you can't do at the Hilton, but the Hilton offers a lot of variety with two pools and the lagoon so even by the end of our stay, the kids were still having fun and weren't close to being bored with any of the resort's pools/lagoon.All in all, a great holiday. We'll be back as I thought the Hilton was a great value when I compare it to our stay at the Westin on Maui last summer. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa has everything a vacationer could want. The Hilton Village has it all: beach, dining at many lounges or restaurants, sports clubs and spa, three pools; each with water slides and jacauzi, snorkeling, and walking paths on the beach to name a few. All are within a short walking distance. Our young girls had a wonderful time with us as there was plenty of things to entertain them so that we could go and do what we wanted some of the time. There are boats or trams to take you to where you want to go if you don't want to walk long distances. The rooms were very comfortable with all the amenities. The staff were all very polite and helpful. We couldn't have found a better place to stay. We have so many absolutely wonderful memories ", " In our trip to Hawaii this past January, we were very impressed with the Hilton Waikoloa. This 1200 plus unit resort is a destination in itself. The lush gardens and landscaping made up for the barren lava rock outside the compound. With a variety of restaurants and activities, it was a world of its own. Swimming with the dolphins was a nice surprise. The dolphins seemed glad to see us and seemed to enjoy the attention of the visitors. The hotel natural lagoon was a great place to swim and had a few local fish and turtles. It was easy to get to the two small shopping areas that had a variety of restaurants. We particularly like Sensei restaurant (in one of the small shopping malls) for their creative sushi and good sake. There is also a large supermarket in that same mall if you want to shop for food. We would recommend this hotel to others who enjoy a large hotel experience - with a 62 acre beautifully landscaped grounds and multiple swimming locations. ", " A little background on my stay: I went with my wife and two girls, 3 and 4 years old, for three nights at the end of February 2009. I was mostly interested in going to a hotel that my girls would enjoy. The pools and water activities looked really appealing. After booking a room in the Lagoon Tower, ocean view, I noticed some reviews saying that the pools were freezing, and was a little worried about this. Some other comments, responding to this, said that this wasn't true. I was also concerned about complaints about rude staff and long waits for the trams and boats. Other comments had nothing but good things to say about the hotel. I found it strange that there were such wildly divergent opinions, and was really curious to find out what the real experience would be like.Unfortunately the weather was not ideal for our stay. All of the islands were experiencing high winds, and even thought the high temperatures were around 80 with mostly sunny skies, it felt cooler, and the wind was a major annoyance. That said, I found the hotel to be an amazing place, with beautiful grounds and lots to do. My girls loved it.The pools were definitely on the cold side, and apparently this wasn't just related to the windy conditions. I asked a pool worker about the water temperature, and he said that most people stay out of the water from mid-December until mid-March or April. Something to consider is that the high temperatures during the winter are around 80 degrees -- definitely warm but not warm enough to want to jump into water of any temperature. The huge pools are definitely amazing, with waterfalls, slides, and caves, but at any time during my stay I'd see only see three or four people in the water. The three jacuzzis are warm and not hot, and these let my girls have some extended water time. By the way all of the jacuzzis are at the Kona Pool at the Lagoon Tower, none at the Kohala Pool at the Ocean Tower. The water in the hotel's lagoon was warmer and my family loved hanging out there. Plenty of sand for making castles and no waves. There are several options for boating or kayaking and this is awesome. We rented a paddleboat and my older girl and I jumped in the water off of the boat. Lots of fish and even a couple of sea turtles.Some reviewers have complained about the long walking distances and having to wait for the boat or tram. We actually loved taking walks -- there are numerous ways to get from one point to another -- walking next the lagoon, under a waterfall, over bridges, or taking the \"indoor\" pathway with is lined with beautiful paintings and sculptures. With my girls, it was sometimes more practical to take the transportation, which they loved too. We never had to wait more than 5 or 7 minutes for a ride. I saw several complaints about broken down trams, and this did happen once to us. However, a tram driver said that new trams will be put into service at the end of March, and I did see them working on the new ones. The boat rides are a little slower, but more fun because they're outdoors and on the water.As far as complaints about rude staff, I'd say that I had more than thirty separate interactions with staff. Not once did I have a bad experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. So unless there's been a complete turnover of staff, I have to view these comments with a lot of skepticism. Some people, I imagine, are looking for a fight and are possibly rude themselves. Or could these be false reviews by people with an agenda?Food is definitely on the expensive side, but you can keep costs down by getting food at the Orchid Cafe or other walk-up places. Better yet, bring your own food and keep it in your room. There's a small, empty fridge in every room. The Waikoloa Village Market is a short drive away and is a decent supermarket. It's a little hidden -- ask somebody if you can't find it. We did do the Inari Japanese restaurant at the hotel twice. We ordered sushi a la carte and were able to eat a decent meal for the four of us at $35.I wasn't bowled over by the quality of our room, but it was clean and perfectly adequate. Plenty big enough for the four of us. Our ocean view room in the Lagoon Tower had a great view of the grounds, and as a bonus directly overlooked the dolphin area. From our balcony we could see the dolphins jumping and frolicking.I wanted to treat my wife the a spa treatment, but the prices are three to four times what you'd pay elsewhere. So she said she'd rather get a full day of treatment back home than pay for two hours at the hotel. Two small rooms for cardio and weights, which you pay a little extra for.For kids, there's Camp Menehune, which can take kids 5-12 for a half day or full day. My girls were too young for this, but they have a daily drop-in session where kids of any age can work on some sort of art project for half an hour while you stay with them. This wasn't amazingly memorable but was free, and just something else that's fun for them. I'd really recommend what they call the Aloha Fun Pass, which costs $25 a day. This reduces either self or valet parking to $7 daily (from $15 and $21 respectively), gets you $25 of boat rental, gives you free access to the cardio and weight rooms, gives you a daily hour of tennis time, and a daily round of mini-golf for two. Awesome value if you want even a few of those things.The dolphins are really great, and if you've got somebody in your group that loves dolphins, they're going to love this place. You could do a paid dolphin interaction, or you can just watch them and talk to the staff, who are very friendly.There is no ocean beach on the property, but I understand that there's a free shuttle or trail to get the Anaehoomalu Bay. We didn't even bother because of the wind during our stay. Since our girls are small, the waveless lagoon was fine anyway.Some people said this place is like Disneyland, which really isn't a fair comparison. It's true that this hotel is man-made resort and tourist destination, with boats and trams. But it's a beautiful place that's very relaxing, and you can totally do it your at your own pace, in your own style. For people that love the water, especially with kids, it's pretty awesome. (Although maybe consider coming when it's not winter!) There are definitely more authentic, down to earth experiences to be had in Hawaii, but if this type of resort experience is what you're looking for, I recommend it. ", " We travelled here on the 2nd leg of our honeymoon in July 2008. This hotel was absolutely incredible, like nothing we had seen!We were staying in the lagoon tower, the furthest from the main lobby area. Although no where near as far as some other reviewers would have you believe! It was handy to have the monorail as a back up in case we had a drink or two too many! It really was only a 5min walk to the tower though!The whole complex has 3 or 4 main pool areas and they are all lovely. The main pool area (which is nearest the lobby) is huge and has a freshwater area where you can swim/snorkel with giant turtles and all kinds of fish. There are also a couple of water slides and waterfalls in the pool part and there is a hot tub hidden away underneath the waterfall.There are 5 or 6 restaurants and of the ones we ate at Kamuela Provision Company was in our opinion the best. It also didn't hurt that we got free dessert because we were honeymooners! The staff were extremely pleasant and the food was amazing - plus the view out into the ocean was incredible!We would also recommend the Dolphin Quest. Although it is a bit on the expensive side, the experience of swimming and feeding the dolphins is something that we will never forget. It could be that we are from Scotland and isn't something we get the opportunity to do very often! The dolphins are extremely well cared for, so don't expect to be pulled through the pool by them - that is totally against what they are there for!One guy that made our stay even more enjoyable was one of the barmen, Kerwin. The staff rotate around the bars so hopefully you will get the chance to meet him. Cocktails galore, great conversation and magic tricks are only some of his skills!!! ", " My wife and I booked this trip for the purpose of relaxing and much needed rest. We knew going into this trip booking this hotel that we wanted a place where we could just relax and not stay to busy. You know how it is when you have a jammed packed vacation where you have to take a vacation from the vacation. The Hilton surpassed every expectation we had. The grounds are immaculate and maintained by a huge grounds crew daily. There wasn't a dead branch flower or blade of grass anywhere. They have very impressive grounds. We stayed 7 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We made full use of all the properties amenities. We snorkeled in the lagoon several days, sat out at all the pools and tried most of the restaurants. Tip: We thought the Kohola pool was the best by far. Not too crowded and warmer than the other pools. The other pools tended to be a bit too cold for us. When I say not to crowded, I mean only 30% of the chairs were being used.  I did read some of the negative reviews from ppl who were there in January. The VH1 crew was finished by the time we got there. So, we did not see any of the issues described. And, I did read Hilton Waikoloa site that in January the tram was shut down for upgrades. Again, the upgrades were finished and we did not have any issues with the trams not running. Keep in mind the facility is huge. So, walking or waiting 10 minutes for either a boat or tram is expected. My wife and I found walking the paths was very relaxing and was a lovely experience. The paths take you through the gardens and next to the ocean. It was a very picturesque walk. We could take a very leisurely relaxing walk using the ocean front paths and get from one end of the property, Ocean Towers, to the KPC, a very nice restaurant at the other end in about 15 minutes. We are both 44 years young and would consider ourselves in average to below average conditioning. If you did choose to walk the outer edge of the property, which is the route the boats and tram takes, it is much further and twice the walk if not more. If you happened to read an earlier review about the rooms keys not working, our keys stopped working as well after the front desk clerk updated them with self park entry. Obviously she made a mistake, we can\u2019t have that \uf04a. But, our experience with such a problem was resolved in a very timely matter. We called the front desk and immediately discussed our issue. Within 5 minutes the security guard showed up and \u201cgrilled us\u201d(sarcasm) to make sure we were the actual occupants, which I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less. Imagine the guard just letting anyone in your room. After showing IDs he let us in and asked us if we had the corrected keys. We did not. So he said he would be right back with our new keys. He was very courteous and gracious. My wife and I did rent a car for a few days and saw the beautiful sights that the Big Island has to offer. But, I do have to admit we were pretty worn out from all the driving and were very pleased to have a place to come back to just to relax. Oh, almost forgot, we chose the upgraded Deluxe ocean view rooms for $240 dollars more for the 7 night stay, it was so worth it. We slept with the lanai doors open every night and could see the humpback whales every morning and evening. The view of the sunset and moon set alone is worth the upgrade. Here are some tips for your stay. The food prices are steep. So, try the Orchid Market Place by the Kona pool. They do have shuttles to the Queens shops that have a food court with the usual McDonalds, Arbys fast food places. If you happen to have a car, go to Waimea, which is 25 minutes away and you can stock up on food at normal prices. But, we did enjoy the finer restaurants on the property. When you arrive, you will be invited to a Big Island introductory from one of the staff members. It was well worth it. You will find out that you can get rides to the beach that is a mile away and around Waikoloa beach village from the valet staff upon request, and I mean instantly. We took a snorkeling cruise with ocean sports and it was a blast. As you can tell, we were very pleased. We were so relaxed that I never wore a watch, turned on the TV, read the news, surfed the web, or any of the other activities that go with a stress filled day.In conclusion, If you are looking for a hotel/resort to relax and make full use of the property and amenities, the Hilton is the perfect choice. If you have every day packed with island activities and don\u2019t plan on staying on the property, then you will want to look at other accommodations. ", " Wife loved it so you know how important that can be! Got a great AAA rate on their website for deluxe ocean view in lagoon tower. Could see the ocean from our bed! Could watch dolphins from our balcony. Yes the resort food prices are high, but the drink specials were decent, had an ice cream $1 scoop hour, great value. The trams were not working but they added more boats, never had to wait long. Don't try to walk the property, much too large. Snorkeling was good in the lagoon, just be sure to look up every once in awhile to make sure some kid in a paddle boat isn't about to run you over! Other than food prices, nothing to complain about, fantastic resort. ", " The most beautiful hotel in all of Hawaii. Staff and amenites are beyond awesome. ", " I spent six nights there while attending a conference (from the 3rd to the 10th of January) and I was very impressed. The staff were helpful and friendly - no, *really* helpful and friendly - the service was great, and I had a complementary late checkout - useful, since the plane was at 9.48 p.m.The pools were good, the room I had was good (Lagoon Tower room with an ocean view, although a friend's room in the Ocean Tower, with a coast and mountain view, was even better). The internet access was okay - cables in rooms, wireless in lounge).There wasn't really anything to complain about (it's expensive, and some of the facilities could maybe do with updating, but it's quite unique, quite special, and must have cost a heck of a lot to build in the first place). Perfect for a week with the kids. At least, that's what I figured. I'll be going back sometime soon, this time with the family. ", " Me and two colleagues went there on a conference and stayed a few more days, as it doesn't happen often that you get to Hawai'i if you live in Europe.The hotel itself has a larger than life feeling, and I must say that you need come to terms with the level of American style \"kitch\" but somehow it all fits the settingthe grounds are very nice, the rooms as wel and the dining opportunities within the hotel or the nearby kings and queens market are more than sufficient. the breakfast buffet is in any case a must-doThe conference area and provisions were very nice, with a lot of room for one large plenary session and many track sessions.the conference was quite a large one with approx 800 people and catering was able to get everybody their food within more than acceptable timeone of our colleagues went swimming with the dolfins in the \"dolfins quest\" pool. while it was expensive, he found that it was certainly worth it! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is really 3 hotels on one big, amazing property. We stayed 2 nights in a partial ocean view room in the Lagoon Tower and loved it there. It is a big property and it does take some time to get around and get to your car. But the pathways along the ocean and through the resort are beautiful, and there's also a tram and boats that run between the 3 hotels on the property. The pools, waterslides, pool caves, waterfalls, suspended rope bridge, ocean-fed lagoon, and dolphin tanks all make it an amazing place to stay, especially for kids. We saw whales from the shore, bottlenose dolphins at the Dolphin Quest area, turtles in the lagoon and basking in the sun on the lava rocks by the Ocean Tower, fish and eels in the lagoon, and lots of geckos and other animals. We loved it and had a great time here. ", " It really is hard to leave this place, that's how amazing the hotel is and the staff are very friendly and helpful.The rooms are nice and clean and have a real Hawaiian feel to them. We had a view of the golf course and ocean and it was beautiful at sunset!The hotel is amazing - you either take a boat or monorail to your part of the hotel which saves you having to walk quite a long distance to your room as the resort is huge! The pools are amazing and there's plenty of them for you to try out, most of which have waterfalls and waterslides for added fun!Breakfast is included in the stay and you can choose between all of the hotels restaurants/cafes, and for those that love the beach the resort is definitely the most picturesque of beach resorts. It sits right on the coral covered shores of the beach and is a photographer's dream!There are heaps of activities to keep you occupied during your stay here including mini golf by the ocean and the hotel has its very own dolphin habitat - where guests can swim and interact with the cute little creatures.If you want to get out of the resort for a bit the Hilton has its own shuttle service to the nearby Kings Shopping Centre where you will find food outlets, designer boutiques and convenience stores.This is truly an amazing place to stay for either a romantic tropical honeymoon or a fun family holiday with the kids. I definitely want to go back! ", " This is a huge resort in an ex excellent location. The weather is always perfect here. The trams and boats around the resort are fun. Take the time to walk through and check out the incredible historical artifacts the resort displays. The rooms aren't huge but they are clean, up dated and have excellent views. We stayed in the lagoon tower overlooking the dolphin lagoon and out to the ocean. The ocean tower has the kids activities center as well as a small adults only pool. But the boat goes right next to in so its kinda loud and smells like gasoline. The pool by the lagoon tower is huge and spectacular with a great kids area. the kohala pool has slides for kids and nice covered cabanas and hammocks. The food in the resort is, of course, pricey but there are restaurants and more shopping across the street. There isn't much night life here. The area is more about outdoor activities and excellent beaches. The beach at the Hilton is a man made bit on the lagoon. There is a free shuttle that goes to A Bay all day. I highly recommend driving down to Hapuna Beach for excellent sand, swimming and snorkeling on the southern side. For Hawaiian shopping be sure to check out the international market in Kailua Kona.Kamuela Provision Company has incredible food and atmosphere. Dress nice and get there at 5:30 for a prime patio table. The macadamia nut kahlua mahi mahi is excellent. ", " My husband (26) and I (24) recently got married off a little island in Kona, Hawaii and my entire family stayed at the Hilton. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!! We had the best time!! The food is awsome! The malola lounge and the tiki bar by the pool have the friendliest bar tenders and the italian restaraunt is amazing!!!!!! We also loved the salt water lagoon where you can snorkel and the lagoon is huge with big waterfalls where all the sea turtles hang out! Oh and there is an amazing restaurant you can take a shuttle to called \"RAYS chophouse\" handsdown the best food we have EVER eaten. I have read 1/2 of these reviews on here and these people are so picky!!! We loved this hotel and you will too!!! My other family stayed at the Marriott which is next door to the hilton..... they have a MUCH better Luau than the hilton but the hilton is def. a nicer place to stay! ", " We just returned from a one week stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village from Christmas to New Year's. We had an excellent experience and, having read some negative reviews of the property on tripadvisor prior to our trip, we came to the conclusion that some people simply have unrealistic expectations. We are an active familiy of five (2 teenage boys and a 10 year old girl) and we travel extensively within and outside of the United States. We have stayed at many 5 star properties and, depending on the purpose of the trip, we have stayed at our share of economy properties as well. The HWV is not the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons. Anyone expecting it to be so will be dissapointed. It is a 62 acre resort with over a thousand rooms and presents all of the benefits and limitations that are inherent in such a big place. We were pleasantly greeted at check-in and given room upgrades for our two rooms (we are long-time Hilton Honors members). We were in the Ocean Tower, which is the furthest tower from the main lobby, tennis courts, parking lot and main pool, as we prefer to be where it is quieter. The rooms were very spacious, spotless and had terraces with beautiful ocean views. To get back and forth to the front of the hotel, we took the train or boat if they were there when we were ready to go. If the train or boat were not there, we simply walked. Many of the complaints in prior reviews focus on the time it takes to get from place to place around the property. The resort is, as noted above, 62 acres. It is hard to imagine how people could expect not to have to spend time getting around when booking a stay at such a large property. This is one of those aspects of a stay at a large property that has to be anticipated. Regarding service, we had none of the experiences mentioned in some of the negative reviews. To the contrary, we found all of the hotel workers to be pleasant and helpful. Our rooms were cleaned by noon every day and we never had a problem. On the two occasions we had need to call the front desk for maintenance related issues, we callled just before leaving for dinner. By the time we returned, the issues had been dealt with. The property itself is beautiful. The walkways, landscaping and views are stunning. The quality of the art collection lining the walkways and spread around the grounds is surprising if you take the time to look at it. We have stayed at the Mauna Lani and felt the grounds here were every bit as nice, if not nicer.When we checked in, we were offered the option of paying a $25.00 per day resort fee which covered parking, health club access, an hour of tennis time a day, use of the putting course and a $25 credit for the lagoon water craft per day. Since self - parking is $15 and an hour of tennis alone is $30, the $25 per day was worthwhile. During our stay we extensively used all of the facilites - we worked out in the health club, played tennis several times, took out the boats/kayaks in the lagoon daily and played the putting course daily - for $10 more per day than the cost of parking. Without the parking and golf features, the resort fee for the second room was only $4.95 per day - well worth the cost as we all played tennis several times and the use of the second court the first time covered the entire resort fee on the second room. Some people have complained that the pools are cold. The pools are not heated, but once you were in, this was not an issue. However, I can understand that some people expect heated pools. Given the size of the pools (they are very large, long, free form pools) and the fact that it is 78-80 degrees every day, I can also understand why the pools are not heated. It would be nice if there was at least one, smaller pool that was heated. Many people have complained about the food costs. I agree that the food is very over-priced. We ate breakfast each morning at the Palm Terrace buffet, which was very extensive but very expensive. I believe the cost is $30 for adults and $20 for children under 12. As Hilton Honors members, we were entitled to complimentary breakfast. If we had had to pay for the breakfast, we would not have done so at $150 a day for our family and woud have purchased food elsewhere and/or utilized the in-room refrigerator. We were aware that the restaurants in the hotel were expensive for dinner and, since we had rented a car, we did not eat any of our dinners at the hotel so I cannot comment on the hotel food, though the restaurants themselves looked to be well-appointed from what we could see. We ate at Merriman's and Daniel Thiebaut in Waimea, Kenichi Pacific at the Shops at the Mauna Lani, Merriman's Cafe and Roy's at the Kings Shops (down the road from the hotel) and a few other places. All of the restuarants we ate at were very good and were not inexpensive, but I think we would have paid more at the hotel. We ate a few lunches at the hotel and the food was standard resort fare - not great but not terrible either - and the lunch prices were failry comparable to what we would have paid elsewhere.We spent a bit of time exploring the Island - visiting the Volcano and Hilo, taking a helicopter ride, swimming with the dolphins and snorkeling a few times at Captain Cook south of Kona. We used the hotel as a base to explore and we alternated our days at the hotel relaxing at the pool and using the facilities with some time seeing the Island. Overall, we had a great time and loved the resort. It suited our needs perfectly and exceeded our expectations in terms of the beauty of the property and the quality of the service. We would definitely return. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Vacation Rentals (condos), about a half-mile from the large hotel resort, and are so thankful we did. We had two, 2-bedroom condos with full kitchens, dining room, washer/dryer, 2 baths and a beautiful balcony. It was all the comforts of home, and even better, housekeeping did dishes, emptied trash, changed bedding and towels everyday. Fabulous way to save money on food (breakfast and dinners in the room, with gas grill outside)! Also, we would have packed a lot less had we known there were washer/dryers in the units.Since you are a Hilton guest, you can access/use all the pools (at the vacation rental and the hotel resort). At any desk/station in the hotel, just show your room key and white pass (they give you when you check in), and they'll give you a colored bracelet for the day. You can also charge food, drink, rentals to your room this way. Park in the main lot (get a ticket when you pull in), and then, before you leave, turn in your ticket to the man in the skirt (yes, he's in a Hawaiian skirt/wrap), show them your white pass, and they'll give you an exit pass and not charge the $15/day parking.Great trip! ", " We stayed at the Waikoloa Hilton resort in Kona Hawaii...First of all, I must comment on how beautiful the resort is...from the moment you arrive you are greeted with courteous bellman to take your luggage to your room. You arrive to grand entrances and the place is magnificent. The gardens in the center of the main hotel are just beautiful with birds, rivers, and exotic fish. They even have a tram system to take you to other parts of the resort. My personal favorite way to travel around the resort is in their boats they purchased from Disney. The ride on the river with the birds, fauna, and waterfall is amazing. The rooms were very clean and well appointed. We had an ocean view room that had large slider overlooking the waves, palm trees, dolphin lagoon. Everything you would want in a Hawaiian vacation! The lanai's were so lovely to enjoy your in- room kona coffee. The room service staff was fantastic as well. I would have liked to see more options on the menu, but what we had was very good! We ate dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company\u2026that was the best meal I ever had in all my years of travel! The tables are set overlooking the ocean to watch a perfect sunset while you get the ocean breezes. The service was impeccable! Each of our meals was cooked to absolute perfection. I had a lightly blackened Mahi Mahi which was delicious, my husband had the steak and scallops which both melted in your mouth. Our server made us feel like a movie star...treated us very special and extremely helpful. I highly recommend eating here during your stay. Our family also had Thanksgiving dinner while we were in Hawaii...which I am going to make every effort to do every Thanksgiving. The staff treated us as if we were family, and was helpful friendly and the food choices unbelievable! They had anything you can think of there and each item was prepared by the finest chefs in this world! The resort is amazing with its huge pools with waterslides, the baby sand pools for toddlers; the lagoon with the perfect sand beach, waterfall, palapas, umbrella chairs was so much fun. They have something for everyone in the family to the paddle boats, bikes, snorkeling in the lagoon. The service was great there even...one lady in particular named Shannon was always on the spot with your volcano drinks...food whatever you needed. They have a boardwalk that goes around the entire resort which is huge right on the ocean. My personal favorite part of the resort was to walk off all the great meals as you watch the waves and look at all the beautiful Hawaiian trees, flowers, bridges, pink flamingos, nenes, and art. In the evenings as you watch the sunset they have a man light each tiki torch as they blow a conch shell our baby loved to see the tiki torches get lit. I can not tell you again how wonderful the staff, service and food were, and most of all the impeccable grounds this resort has to offer. I can highly recommend this resort for your family vacation, or a romantic getaway where you want to be pampered and enjoy a beautiful resort with something for everyone. ", " This Hotel is just fantastic for all ages. This hotel was my family's entire vacation because there is just so much to do at the hotel. There are many different kinds of restaurants, activities, events, and lots of shopping. This hotel has two kids/family pools and one adult pool, and a huge water sport and snorkeling lagoon full of turtles and fish. This hotel has a wonderful spa with the best staff around. This hotel is so large that they have trains and boats to get from one side of the hotel to the other. They also have a Dolphin Quest with many different dolphin encounter programs for kids and adults. There are tennis courts and there is a great gym to work out in. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at in my entire life. You must stay here. :) ", " Great return trip. Excellent service. Some changes were made at the hotel that I thought were great. Happy hour was added at the lagoon grill and the bar was open till 7 pm. Golf courses had discounted rates. Staff was excellent. The hilton honors lounge was eliminated. Some families who abused the lounge may be disappointed. Now you get to eat a sit down breakfast at the palm terrace with waiters and waitresses. Some moochers may be disappointed. No more inviting extended family to breakfast. ", " I had read many of the reviews on this site after we had booked our trip and I became a bit concerned. The only complaint I have is that I wish we could have stayed longer. We experienced no issues during our seven days at HWV. The staff was always friendly and wiling to help when we asked any questions. We took the time to walk as much of the property as we could in order to appreciate where we were staying. We had most of our meals at the Queens Marketplace which is a short drive from HWV. Our room was always made up right after we left for breakfast each morning. We had a deluve ocean view room in the Lagoon Tower and spent a few hours during a couple of days at the pool by the Lagoon Tower. We enjoyed being greated by the cats each evening when we returned to the hotel and we did not find the walk to the hotel from the parking lot that bothersome. We were on vacation and made sure to enjoy ourselves. I could go on and on about how pleased we are that we chose to stay here. Each year we go to a differnt island. The next time we come to BI we will for certain stay at HWV. ", " My husband and I spent a week here in September of 2008 and had a wonderful time. We are timeshare owners and last year we stayed at the HGVC property up the road. We loved it so much that we agreed to return to the island at a special discounted rate if we would sit through a timeshare presentation. As timesharing veterans, this wasn't a problem for us so we agreed, and one year later we were back. When we checked in they put us on the ground level which we weren't too enthused about so on our way to dinner I requested a room on a higher floor and they accommodated us with no problem. We were in the Palace Tower, which is the central tower on the property. We were told to wait for the train to take us to our room but the train is slow and we were impatient so we ended up walking. By the time we got there, we were exhausted (it was hot and the luggage was heavy) and a bit cranky that we had to walk such a long distance. We ended up hardly ever taking the train. It was either going the wrong direction or we were in a rush and didn't feel like waiting. After the first day we were over the distance and actually enjoyed walking through the resort. I recently read an article that said September occupancy in the Islands was down significantly from last year, particularly on the Big Island. This is not surprising because it felt like we had the whole resort to ourselves. On many occasions I was the only person at the adults only pool. We loved the quiet and would highly recommend going here in September, especially if you aren't too fond of kids. The first week of September is perfect. School is back in session and most parents won't take their kids out of school during the first week. Plus, the weather is pretty reliable this time of year. The only real gripe I have is that the Orchid Cafe is no longer a full-service restaurant. We really enjoyed that restaurant on our last trip and woke up the first morning to head out there for waffles only to find out that it was a serve yourself, over-priced convenience store. They have pre-packaged scrambled eggs and hashbrowns, cereal and pastries and that's about it. There is a restaurant at the Ocean Tower that serves breakfast, but it is expensive and is swarming with birds. The parking lot is a bit of a walk from the resort, but it's not that bad. There is a daily fee to park which is kind of annoying because it's not like you have a choice but to rent a car. Overall our experience was great but we prefer to stay at the HGVC. We like the feel of being in a condo vs. a hotel room and the parking is free. The required timeshare presentation was painless and we enjoyed the bonus $100 on a spa treatment.Regardless if you stay at the hotel or the HGVC, this is a beautiful resort and you won't be disappointed. ", " Great place to stay - Rooms are great - Fun place with all the pools - walkways - waterfalls - dolphins - boat rides - Except for the price of food at the restaurants, you wouldn't have to leave the resort. We opted to eat at the King's Shops or the Queens' Market Place. ", " Aloha!I wish I could say, don't go there, so to leave the Hilton all to me. It was Beautiful to walk into the large open lounge area and see the lagoon right there. Turtles were feeding right on the edge of the walkway. Waterfalls flowing to the left and a beach off to the right. To get to your room, you needed to ride the boat or the tram. At times, it was a bit inconvenient and we would just walk. It's not that bad. We had an awesome room that over looked the dolphin quest so we saw dolphins all day. The hotel people were all pleasant and helpful. Great clean rooms. Hawaii is the best island. You can stay in Kona or drive to Volcano. The best of both worlds. Mahalo. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa in Oct. 2008 for 3 nights. I booked this resort on Priceline, so got a great price. I called a week in advance and asked for a King room, non-smoking, and that's what I was given at check-in. Our stay got off to a rocky start when I pulled up in our rental car. We were swarmed by the valet staff, who were very rude to us once they found out we intended to self-park. Self-parking is $15 a night billed to your room, and you just swipe your room pass to get in and out. The lot was just down the hill, and it was an easy walk for us; but the resort was not busy while we were there. Check-in was quick and easy, and we let the bellman take our bags instead of trying to put them on the tram. He got to the room before we did. When leaving, we did take our own bags on the tram as we didn't want to wait for someone to come get them. The resort website shows the grounds and amenities well, and looked just as shown. We had a garden view room in the ocean tower, which was quiet. I can imagine some of the ocean view rooms might be noisier. Our King room had a loveseat and desk, and chairs outside on the patio. The a/c was quiet and worked well. Our room was clean and well maintained. We rode the tram and the boat around the resort, and had no problems. Also walked back to our room once, it is about 15 min. from the main building. Plenty of loungers available near all the pools, and towels are given from a building nearby. We thought the water was cold-I was surprised none of the pools was heated. No beach for sunbathing or even walking along, but the view was gorgeous with the black lava rocks and ocean waves. Grab a lounger early to see the sunset! The food and drink prices were outrageous, so we did not eat there, but instead drove the mile to the Kings and Queens shops. The Kings shops had a restaurant and a good fish and chips place where you eat outside. The Queens shops had a food court with Arby's, Subway's, pizza, etc., and a Macaroni Grill is due to open soon. We ate lunch there, and then bought a sub to put in our fridge for dinner, and that worked out well for us. There is also a nice grocery store at the shops, with reasonably priced hot and cold prepared food. They have a shuttle every 20 minutes to the shops for $1, but we just used our rental car. They will also drive you to a nearby beach free of charge if asked. All the staff, with the exception of the parking crew, was friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that it is hard to find out about activities going on at the resort. I would definitely stay here again if I could get a good price. ", " Stayed nine days at HWR. Our 2nd trip there within one year. Need I say more? Sure. This place covers 62 acres. There is no reason to be in a hurry. The Pathways surrounding the resort offer a relaxing trip through a truly amazing Asian art collection. The Palace Tower is an Art Gallery in an among itself! Walkways along the ocean will take you past Dolphin Quest, the \"Lagoon\" where one can snorkel. Keep walking and eventually you will end at Buddha Point, where you can watch those amazing Hawiian sunsets every night. There is a lot of walking. Be prepared to enjoy!!!Yes, the food is expensive. Count on approximately $15 - 18 per person minimum per meal at the resort. This is no more than any other resort of this type. You can go offsite, however, and reduce those costs. By the way, don't forget to have your Kona Drip every morning at the Kimo Bean.The rooms a very comfortable. No surprise.The boat \"commute\" is always fun. You can get from one end of the resort to the other. Plenty to see along the way. The tram provides another \"cool\" option to make the same trip.The staff was friendly, and the service excellent.The cats in the parking lot are fed daily and are spayed and neutered.We will always go back. ", " I was so sad to leave this place after 7 days that I almost cried!The place is incomparably beautiful. It was a perfect vacation with a 16 month old.To sum it up...PROS:--Grounds are stunning. I loved just walking around the hotel and missed it every time I left. --Great for toddlers. My toddler enjoyed riding the boats and trains, swing in the hammock, looking at the dolphins, wading in the lagoon, playing on the life-sized checker board, and walking on the suspension bridge over the pool.--The Lagoon was wonderful for timid snorkelers because the water was very shallow yet you could even see the occasional sea turtle.--Sea Turtles! They come close enough to see from land.--Dolphins! There are about 12 of them that you can watch from quite nearby. You can even eat lunch and watch them at the Lagoon Grill.--Orchid Cafe & Room Service food was good.--Staff was friendly and helpful.CONS:--Yes the grounds are huge and at times it was a bit of an inconvenience, especially when trying to get to your car.--Food prices were extremely high. Food at Kirin was not worth it at all.--Don't seem terribly stroller or handicapped-friendly though I saw plenty of smaller babies in strollers. There were lots of steps.--Pools are too cold.--$$ for internet.COMMENTS ON PRIOR REVIEWS:--We weren't charged for in-room coffee. OFF-GROUNDS:--Hapuna Beach is a must-see beach. --We ate at Merriman's Cafe in Kings Shops 2x (great food but so-so service). --Pesto Cafe is good and near one of the National Parks and the Hamakua Macadamia Nut Factory (15 minute drive).--I'm not so sure the drive to the volcano was worth it...it was a lot of driving and there wasn't a lot of volcanic activity to see. Figure 2.5 hrs each way plus more driving once you're in the park. If there is new activity, then it's another story. ", " UNBELIEVABLE is all I can say. We were here for four days and found it so hard to leave. This hotel truly is the Disneyworld of Hawaii. It is super for families. There are multiple buildings on this property. In other words it is mutiple hotels in one all with different themes. The grounds are unmatched with art from all over the world displayed everywhere. There is a river that connects the main promenade (lobby) to the rest of the property. You can take a boat ride to get to your destination (much fun) of there is a tram for faster transport. We swam with the dolphins one day at Dolphin Quest and will never forget it. The grounds are covered with pools that have water slides, fountains, waterfalls, hiden coves for privacy, you name it. There is a golf course cut right into the lava fields right next to the hotel and it is not to be missed. The hotel also faces west so you see the sun set right from your room everyday. At this hotel there is so much to do you will find it difficult to leave the property. Don't stay her for a short period of time or you will be sorry. The truly amazing thing is the service. Your room is cleaned promptly everyday, however you never see any service people as they stay down in the bowels of the property in undreground tunnels where they move about the property unnoticed. I could go on and on forever about the value of a stay here, but I am hoping you get the picture. We were fortunate to have friends tell us about it and then saw a feature on it on the travel channel. If you can afford this Hilton. STAY HERE!!!!! ", " Every year our family stays here for a mini trip. Our kids love their pools and the lagoon where there are so many activities for them to do. Probably wouldn't like this place when its busy because of the fact you have to take a train or boat to get around. We walked from one end to the other and it took us an hour.not doing that again. But we will stay here again ", " After reading some of the reviews from this site, I was a bit concerned about this hotel. However, upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth and beauty of this hotel. The grounds are outstanding and immaculate with beautiful artwork and sculptures at every turn. The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, promptly responding with efficiency. We booked our trip through Costco so breakfast was included in our package. The omelet station was excellent and the selection of fruits, muffins, and cereals were more than plentiful. Even though many previous guests complained about the walking and tram, we found it to be quite the contrary. We loved walking along the art walk or strolling the beach route. There is so much beauty to see and it can take your entire stay to see all the wonderful sights. We did use the boat and tram when we had things to carry, but most of the time we enjoyed the peaceful journey to our room in the Ocean tower.This is a wonderful property for children and families! It is very safe and suitable for all ages. It is best to rent a car if possible, but if not, the hotel will shuttle you to nearby restaurants. Finally, you will LOVE the sunsets at this property;, whether sitting at one of their restaurants or watching it by the Buddha sculpture at the highest peak on the property. Simply majestic! Thank you Hilton for a great vacation. ", " My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village from Sep 1st - Sep 6th. We had a really fantastic time. The resort is huge (as everyone else has said) and is very beautiful. You really can stay there for days and not go anywhere else (though we did and had fun on the whole island). We loved that the resort was big and we did do a lot of walking. For us this is really nice because we don't get enough activity normally. If you don't enjoy walking and taking time to get around, you may not like this resort. We loved it. There was so much to do, so many places to eat, etc. Many people have said the same so I will briefly sum up my recommendations on how to best enjoy your stay here. OVERALL THOUGHTS ON THE RESORT:1. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower which meant we were close to the dolphins, pools, registration, and parking. If we weren't that close to these things, we may have had a different opinion about how spread out the resort is. 2. We had an oceanview room looking at the ocean and the dolphin lagoon which was really amazing and worth the extra money. I watched the dolphins every morning and afternoon. The palm trees block views too high up. We were on the 4th floor and I wouldn't want to be higher.3. We did purchase drinks and snacks at markets to help offset some food costs. The market at Queens Plaza (very close by) was great. We also went to Kona Natural Foods after a snorkle trip down that way.4. There are laundry rooms here which is nice to know. I would have packed lighter had I known how easy it would be to do laundry if needed.5. We took the boat around a lot especially for dinners and treated it as a fun and relaxing part of the vacation. This is not a great place to be in a hurry so since we planned to not be in a hurry, we never found it frustrating or difficult to find a boat or tram. In fact, we took the boats on purpose just for fun even though they were slower.6. We went there after high season. The hotel was definitely not full so this may have contributed to how much we enjoyed it vs others who were there at peak times like 4th of July. NOW ABOUT THE FOOD AND MY FOOD ALLERGIES:I am allergic to a lot of things: gluten, dairy, eggs, corn, etc. As you can imagine this makes it difficult to travel, though I do travel often. I usually have to bring food with me and plan everything out in advance and still end up getting sick sometimes. Executive Chef Ken Omiya, his assistant Kelly, Chef Sasha at Donatelli's, and the Chef's at Imari and Orchid really took good care of me. They really understand what it means to prepare food for people with food allergies. Most places can do it but the food is only OK or may get a little cross-contamination. If you have bad food allergies, this can still be a real problem. Chef Omiya and team are fully equipped and able to make allergy safe food that tasted amazing!!! This really made my trip (as any food allergy sufferer can attest to). I can\u2019t have gluten, but they made me gluten free muffins, bread, pasta, cookies\u2026 it was so amazing for me and such a relief for my husband who worries about how we will plan meals while traveling.Chef Omiya really went out of his way for me. He came and checked on me at meals, he even made me cookies (that were amazingly good) for my plane ride home. I can\u2019t express how much I appreciate that he spends time understanding how to take care of people with food allergies so they can have a great stay at the resort. It took so much pressure off of us to not have to worry about food for our entire trip. Kelly, the Chef's Assistant, was amazing too. I talked to her every day and she could not have been nicer or more helpful. She helped with reservations and let people know about my allergies in advance. She was really great.Chef Sasha at Donatelli\u2019s also made the most amazing gluten and dairy free pasta dishes for me. I typically don\u2019t eat at Italian restaurants anymore because they don\u2019t carry gluten-free pasta (which is unfortunate because I love Italian food). Donatelli\u2019s always has it on hand and the chef made it better than I ever could at home. My husband has no food allergies and also loves Italian food and he was amazed at how good the food was here too. We went back a second night because of how great it was. FINAL THOUGHTSI really love to travel and see new places so I don\u2019t often return to places that I have been before. I know that I will return to Hilton Waikoloa Village. The resort was beautiful, we had an amazing time with the dolphins, our room and view were lovely and relaxing, and the food was amazingly good and safe for a serious food allergy sufferer. That is well worth the price of admission!! ", " This is a fantastic resort property. There is so much to see and do here! Yes, the food is expensive, but you can go down the street to eat for less. We have been to 3 of the Hawaiian islands and stayed in several hotels, and by far this one is the best!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone! ", " We just returned from several days and this resort has it all! We walked into this gorgeous lobby and saw both a boat and a tram waiting to take anywhere. They both run throughout the entire resort. The boat staff were so helpful with sightseeing tips about the island. The resort staff were so very courteous, gracious and welcoming. The rooms were well-appointed and our room (in the Dolphin Tower) overlooked the lagoon, the dolphin bay AND the ocean. It was absolutely breathtaking. My husband went to one of the Dolphin Encounter classes. The instructors were quite educated about marine life and were very well-informed about the dolphins and their needs. The dolphin experience was so awesome. The pools (which included a waterfall, waterslide and little grotto) are gorgeous and the pool wait staff was attentive and catered to our every request. The ONLY thing that was less than perfect was a bird issue in an outdoor restaurant that served breakfast. (The food was awesome. However, there were many birds throughout the restaurant that would swoop in and steal any food left unattended - even for just a moment.) The wait staff in the restaurants and lounges were excellent; the food and cocktails were topshelf. The resort was truly paradise. ", " Just returned from our honeymoon at the Hilton Waikaloa Village. This place was fantastic. My only complaint was that we had to stand in line for about five minutes upon arrival at registration, which was aggravating after such a long day of travel. But after that, zero complaints. Every part of the hotel property is beautiful. Our room was off in the ocean tower, on the far side, so it did take a while to get there from parking, but that turned out to be not an issue. The grounds are so beautiful, you can take the tram or the boat from each end of the grounds to any point in between, or if we didn't want to wait, the long walk from the parking lot to our room was no bother, as there were variable routes (through shaded open halls filled with countless pieces of artwork) or a couple of trails along the shore, lagoon, etc... We did spend most of our time exploring the big island (green sand beach, southern point, volcanoes NP, waterfalls on the eastern coast, kailua kona, etc...) and managed only to spend a couple days enjoying the amenities of the hotel. The various pools are all great with beautiful waterfalls, fun slides, and they are so big that privacy was never an issue. The lagoon was great, and does a good job of making up for the fact that this hotel does not have a beach on the ocean shore, it is all rock and coral; it makes up for this with a nice little beach in the lagoon, and snorkeling in the lagoon was beautiful, we saw numerous reef fish as well as a couple of big old turtles cruising around. I swam out into the bay which is allowed with the rental snorkel gear, should you feel the need. The closest beach is about 1/2 mile south; there is a shoreline trail from the hotel to the beach (which is at the Marriot) which takes about 5-10 minutes of walking on a semi-rough trail, rough only due to the large pieces of coral and lava rock that make up the trail. Or you can drive and park in the public beach lot which is small, as the beach is not very crowded. Apparently there are several great beaches on the coast north of the hotel within a 10 minute drive, but we didn't have time to check them out. As for our room, it was excellent, spacious, they responded instantly to requests for service, and the few times we ordered room service, the food came quickly, was delicious, and came in large quanities. We had a nice view of the ocean and the golf course north of the hotel. We usually ate out in various towns during our daytrips (try Bamboo in Hawi, it was the best of the trip, but be aware that Hawi is a quiet country town and they roll up the streets pretty early) but we had dinner our last night in the hotel. The Provision Company was booked, so I suggest early reservations, Imari was closed that night and the previous night. We decided to try Kirin, the Chinese restaurant. Everything was delicious, it was not crowded, and was quiet. It was of course a little expensive as all restaurants at the hotel seemed to be, but not overly so. We had lunch once sitting in the shade at the lagoon. It was good, and again came in large quantities and wasn't too expensive for the convience of service.Our lone regret is that we didn't have enough time. Enough time to both enjoy the Hilton more, and see more of the big Island. There is so much to do there, we didn't rush and now have an excuse to return. Though I like to try out different locations and hotels, I think next time we go to the big island we will stay at the Hilton again, I don't see how you can do better.Other points worth mentioning: Hilo Hattie is a great store in Kona to buy gifts for people as well as nice aloha shirts. The Luau at the Royal Kona Resort was relatively cheap (compared to others), had free drinks (they weren't stingy with the rum if you wanted a little more in your mai-tai), and was a pretty good show. Everywhere you go, everyone is friendly and helpful, whether its just to say Aloha, chat up about where you are from, or asking if you need help taking a picture. The police are hard to notice driving around in all types of unmarked cars, but are there, but I can't imagine they have a huge crime problem on the big island. ", " We just returned from weeklong stay at this exceptional hotel. We arrived late at night, it took us about 30 minutes to get to the hotel after checking out a rental car. Check-in was very fast, the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. We used valet park the first night, and self park on the rest of the stay. The room is very nice and spacious with lots of closet space. Services are very good all around. The landscape throughout the hotel is very attractive. The pools are very nice as well. People often complain about the tram and the boat. We never had any problem with either one. Two trams were operating in both directions at the same time. On average, the wait was less than 5 minutes. From the parking lot, it took us about 10 minutes to get to our room in the Palace Tower. The nearby food court at the queen's Marketplace was convenient when we didn't feel like driving to Kona to eat. We had a good time at the Hilton and definitely will stay there again. ", " We arrived on the Big Island, wondering if we'd made a mistake. The drive from the airport reminded us of a lava desert. But our fears were immediately laid to rest when we arrived at the resort. The bell staff was courteous and prompt - directing us to the check-in counter. The registration staff was professional and helpful. As my husband is a Hilton Honors Gold member, we received certificates for continental b'fast every day of our week-long stay, as well as free bottled water at the spa. We weren't expecting that. (Continental b'fast certificates could also be used toward a portion of the charge for full buffet or toward a regular b'fast menu item.) We self-parked our rental car - a short walk - not at all what I would have expected at a resort of this size. THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS!!! Our room in the Palace Tower was just what we expected. Beautifully appointed, and spacious. The \"closet\" was an open space, that left plenty of room to store suitcases and hang clothes for our family of 4. Coffee was replenished daily. Beds were a bit softer than we're accustomed to - but that's just us. Pillows felt like down-filled. (The only thing I didn't care for - I like a poly-filled. I'll bring my own next time, or request a firmer one.) The grounds are beyond belief. Landscaping was absolutely gorgeous. Staff constantly trimming, watering, tending every little detail. The pools were busy, but large enough that you never felt like you were swimming w/ a big crowd. Waterslides enough fun for kids and parents, alike. If you want to stay at the pool, but have had enough of the sun - just go to the grotto. My husband enjoyed several little naps back there, with the lull of the waterfall as background! Dolphin Quest was so cool. Our children both participated in the program. The staff was helpful, patient and very knowledgable. We \"camped\" on the hill and got excellent video and photos. One of our kids' best memories - well worth it. Food was expensive - but we expected that at a resort destination. (You wouldn't expect to get a bargain on food at Disney World - why would you expect it here?) Portions were very large - we usually shared entrees at lunch. The macadamia nut encrusted chicken sandwich on taro bread on the dock overlooking Dolphin Quest was almost a daily indulgence for us! Absolutely delicious! We didn't visit the more formal restaurants at the resort - opting for something away from the hotel - but the menus looked varied and the atmosphere at all restaurants was just beautiful. One note - our daughter celebrated her 16th birthday on July 4th, and when the wait staff at breakfast saw her gifts, they gathered together and had a surprise cake delivered to our table and they serenaded her. Nothing we pre-arranged - just gracious Hawaiian hospitality. The Hawaiian Sea Turtles are very plentiful in the lagoon and on the lava shoreside. They climb up to sun themselves on the lava every day. You can walk right up to them and they don't shy away. It's against the law to touch them. I got one picture of our children standing on the lava w/ NINE (9) turtles around them! So fun. Also saw lots of fish and an eel in the resort lagoon while snorkeling. Don't miss Hapuna Beach - absolutely gorgeous and only about 15 minutes from hotel. Great food at concession stand. Snorkeling was incredible - didn't see any turtles here, but the fish were HUGE and SO colorful. Take a disposable underwater camera. Clean, sand beach - good showers onsite. Shops at Kings/Queens centers near hotel just okay for us. Nice to have a little market to grab some snacks to keep in the room. (Look for the macadamia Hershey Kisses - they're unbelievable!) If you want to take home inexpensive souvenirs, best bet is to go into Kona, but go early. Traffic gets very congested in the afternoon. Walmart/Safeway in Kona good.  Don't miss the volcano, but plan on spending the better part of the day driving around the island and taking time to stop along the way. Go to the Volcano Visitors Center first, then to the caldera and finally drive down to the coast to see the flow into the sea. WEAR SNEAKERS! If you go after dark, be sure to bring flashlights - you'll walk about 3/4 mile across a lava field in the dark. It's one of the highlights of our trip - we were speechless. I've never seen so many stars in my life - so bright - it felt like you could reach up and touch them. We even saw a wild boar as we were walking back to our car! I hope this review helped - it was a truly wonderful experience for our family at Hilton Waikoloa Resort. We're hoping to go back again next Christmas. Aloha! ", " We stayed here on Hilton points - got a week free. We loved it - and not because we didn't pay for the hotel. Yes, it is very large - but, it didn't take more than 10 minutes to walk to the lobby (we were in the Palace Tower) and 15-20 minutes to walk to the spa and tennis courts. The grounds were fabulous. We enjoyed the lagoon and watching everyone else play with the dolphins. The hammocks were great, but get there early to find an empty one. The restaurants were very nice and were a bit pricey. The spa was great, and we used the tennis courts almost every day. I would highly recommend this hotel, if you don't mind rocky beaches (try Maui for great sand beaches). I know a lot has been said about the cost, but it is Hawaii - I've been to all islands, and they are all expensive. But, this place is quite an experience. ", " What a perfect hotel, absolutely gorgeous grounds and the staff were more than friendly. We stayed here for a week for our honeymoon after being in Orlando for ten days and I can't help but disagree with the comments about it being like Disney - yes it's big and over the top but people would moan if it wasnt saying that they expected more from a Hilton!! There are 18000 pieces are artwork around the grounds and this makes it lovely to walk round. Yes the three hotel room blocks are spaced out but this means that it doesnt feel like a busy city when. You're walking around. If they are closer together it would feel like you never got any time to yourself. The tram is slow (the boat was under maintenance when we were there) but we only used this when we arrived to get our cases to the room. Bell boys are available but I'm capable of wheeling my case so did. If you are able to walk then I wouldn't suggest taking the tram arou d the hotel, there is p,entry to look at around the hotel so why bother. You could always get sun beds at the pools and lagoon so no issues there, they also provide towels and give you a wrist band. At the lagoon, which is where we spent most of our time, you can ren body boards, pedalos and snorkelling gear but this is quite pricey. There are turtles and fish in the lagoon to swim with which was lovely.Food is expensive but we knew this before we left as I'm sure everyone else did who chose to stay here. We ate at the Chinese and Italian which were lovely, The breakfast can be expensive eat all you want is $30 each we ate a few times from the cereal place but seriously they offer to put sweets like skittles and mnms on your cereal????!!! I don't get that at all. People expect to be tipped a lot, I don't mind tipping for dinner service but I'm not tipping someone to pour me and orange juice! We went to the Lual which was great I would recommend the upgrade for the drinks, cocktails are $11 each so it's worth it. The food is lovely and the dancing was great, the lady serving us was so friendly I wanted to bring her home!! Someone before mentioned having a small room, we stayed in the ocean tower and I've never known a room so big, we had a queen size bed, nice balcony, bathroom, separate sink, mini walk in wardrobe, safety depsit box, hair dryer, fridge and coffee maker. The front desk also ordered my taxi back to the airport. No complaint I would definitely return to hawii and this hotel, I wish more English would make the trip, we saw nine whilst we were there and they're missing out!! ", " Imagine this......Sitting with a pina colada in your hand near the pool and the ocean. Listening to the waves. Soaking the sun in and the weather is just gorgeous. I turn to my husband and he\u2019s SNORING!!! That is how relaxing this place is I\u2019m not kidding guys. That is why we come to Hawaii. This is why we return to the Hilton Waikoloa Hotel. Great service. Good food. The softest beds that you will ever sleep in your entire life. They have so many things for kids to do on this property so you will never need to worry about them being bored. This Hotel is well maintained and just BEAUTIFUL. Overall this is our second time at the Hilton Waikoloa and I\u2019m happy that we spent our money here. ", " My best friends parents took us to Hawaii for our graduation present and we had and amazing time. The Hilton was incredable! The resort is huge but there is a tram and boats that take you around the resort! The main complaint I had was there wasn't a beach. The resort made a lagoon with a beach. It is very safe jbut kinda stinky! However Hapuna beach which is rated one of the top in Hawaii is just a few miles north. We stayed in the ocean tower which was on the other side of the resort than the large pool and water slide but the tram made it an easy 5 min (air conditioned) ride away. However on our side we had the adults only pool and the \"kids pool\" (really several little pools connected by small slides that empty into a lazy river). It made us wish we were kids again! The large water slide was alot of fun and it is separated from the large pool by a waterfall that you can swim under to reveal 2 large hot tubs. The spa was great. We loved the steam room and the CocoMango products! While at the resort you have to have a lava flow! It has been my favorite drink ever since! It is a pina colada swirled with strawberries. Yummmmm! The resorts gift shop was high, just like ever other resort! But you can take the shuttle down to Kings shops and go to the general store and find a larger variety for about half the price! You should also try Walmart in Kona, they have a large section of gifts and low prices. Don't eat at the chinese resturaunt it was really over priced and the food was just ok. There is a steakhouse at the Kings shops that had a really good prime rib and it wasn't over priced. In fact eat off of the resort as much as possible, there is also a place to order pizza at the Kings shops. We took it back to the resort and ate it on the Lani. ", " I took my 5 year old daughter here in Feb. 2008 for a week stay. We had a fantastic time. Everything went smoothly from Check-In to Check-Out. I live about 15 minutes from the airport we flew out of and the hotel is 15 minutes from the Kona airport. We had a direct flight and it was the easiest traveling I've ever done :) The hotel does not have a shuttle so book a ride from the local shuttle beforehand.Our room was located in one of the farthest towers from the lobby, main pool, dolphins, etc. If you are booking for convience instead of value book a room in one of the closer towers. It actually worked out for us because my daughter loved taking one of the trams or boats anytime we went anywhere.Pools were great! One pool has 2 waterslides that are great for kids under 41 inches and also has a \"Big Kid\" waterslide. The other \"main\" pool has a sandy bottom kiddie pool ( a must for parents with toddlers ) 2 waterfalls, a twisty waterslide and 3 hot tubs. It also has a rope bridge that my daughter loved. My only gripe about the pools was that there was no hot tub close to the Garden Tower and there is no swim up bar ( bars close to the pool though ).The Dolphin Encounter was a huge hit as well. If you are going for value skip it. My daughter was just as happy sitting watching the dolphins as she was in the water with them. There was a baby dolphin which was very exciting. If you end up doing The Dolphin Experience make sure you have one adult on shore taking pictures. Buying their pictures are VERY expensive. Lots of reviews about food being expensive. It's true if you go all out at every meal. If you want to stick to a budget try to do breakfast in your room or at the coffee bars, Lunch at the cafes, and dinner at one of the restaurants. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village resort for 3 days/2 nights last week, and it was more fabulous than photos and the website. The room was wonderful and impeccably clean, the property was extraordinary, with several great pools (with slides for the kids), a sheltered beach, Dolphin Quest program, and a walking trail along the shore. The casual Lagoon Grill was a nice place to grab a quick bite and watch the dolphins and the sunset. With so much to see on the island, I could have been at the resort a whole week, with hammocks, cabanas, golf, and other restaurants we never got to explore.The Dolphin Quest program was expensive but fantastic! My teens loved their 30 minute session. Book early if you can; some classes filled up while we were there.Of note is that the King's and Queen's market places (just down the street) were very nice and offered a good shopping and eating selection (including Starbucks and Subway). Also, valet parking (an additional $9/day) was well worth it for 2 nights.As for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the drive was over 2 hours for us, since we also stopped by the Waipio Lookout (awesome!) and Akaka Falls (alright...). Ken's (south of Hilo) was a great \"original\" place for a quick pancake lunch; staff was super. The eruption site was spectacular with smoke plumes, clearly visible from the Jagger Museum. Thurston Lava Tube was cool. Ask a park ranger if the lava has been visibly pouring into the sea. There is a road outside the park (rt. 130?) that leads to a vantage point to the east of the park, about an hour away from the Park's visitor center. We did not go, but a resort guest had gone on July 7 at sunset, and said the lava flow was brilliant in the darkness; they had to trek across a lava field with a flashlight, but there had been a hundred or so people there doing the same. We so wish we had gone...Vog was noticable at the Jagger Museum and Lava Tube, but not at the resort. From the Hilton Waikoloa to HVNP, be sure to take the route around the north of the island -- it's gorgeous, has Waipio Lookout nearby, and is not so isolated/switchback-ish as the southern route. (we did both)I highly recommend the Hilton Waikoloa Village, and hope to return soon. Aloha!!! ", " I stayed here 9 years ago, and just this month, and things haven't changed a bit.62 acres of pure Hawaii. We were trying to see so much of the island, we were killing ourselves with tourism, so we just stayed at the hotel one day and went to all the different pools, and amenities, and had a blast. Then we had to go to Waikiki, and yuck, what a tourist trap!We had an ocean front room, but it really didn't matter. Any room had a view of the beautiful grounds.We got a package that included breakfast, so, at $30 a pop that was a nice deal. Plus free parking saved us $12 a day. And a credit toward a rental in the lagoon, which the kids couldn't get enough of. Reminder: The lagoon goes down about 3 feet, so check when the tides are high, and there will be more water to play in. Watch for the turtles to ride the current out to sea in the evenings, it's just like in the movie Nemo. We stayed in the pools, just couldn't get enough of the big one. A bit chilly, but we got used to it. In the afternoon, the sun warmed the pools alot. The jacuzzis looked like a breeding ground for who knows what, so we made that visit short and sweet. Slides were open for a short time mid-day, so plan accordingly. ( if you lay down on the big slide, and lift your butt up, you go the fastest..according to a 9 year old we met, and was he right).See the sights of the island, but don't forget to do absolutely nothing, that's what Hawaii is all about. ", " We traveled to the Big Island in July for a family vacation (wife, 12 y/o girl, in laws and myself) for 10 days at the Hilton. This was the first time I have ever been to Hawaii. My wife has been to the island before. To give a little background, I am a diamond member of the Hilton program and an elite passenger for most airlines. Wy wife and I have been to many resort area's including Cancun, Punta, Jamaica, Paradise Island plus a few more. We normally stay in nice 4 star hotels.This hotel beat them all. From the minute you walk into the front lobby to the second you check out. The people are much friendlier than any other resort we have been, the food is pricey but good portions and good tasting. You will never taste fruit that is any better.The room was big and had a small frig, coffee pot, safe and large closet. It was very clean and well kept along with a very nice and comfortable bed.Any place that you can go to one of two large pools, swim in the lagoon with sea turtles and fish and meet some of the nicest people, it must be paradise.A car is a must while on the Big Island unless you want to stay at the resort and not go anywhere. We went on a deep sea fishing charter (caught a couple), snorkel tour with Body Glove (very fun) and a helicopter ride (wow!). We also visited Hilo and the volcano national park. We had a great time and I am sure your family will do the same. Just remember, you are on vacation and make sure you plan on spending money. I don't know how you could rate this place and hotel any except a 5 star. ", " I have just returned from a weeklong stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, and have to say, I was blown away! After reading several reviews questioning the star level of this property, I must say that all of those people had to have been somewhere else. ;-)  I was with my family at this resort, and found that the level of service and quality was on par with that of the highest level of resorts. Personally, I think this resort could be upgraded to the level of a Conrad Hilton hotel. Yes, it is big. And Yes, do can do a lot of walking. Some people may consider that a drawback, but I like to think that exercising is good for you. It's not like you don't have any other options to get around, because you do. There were 2 monorails running most of the day and night, as well as a fleet of gorgeous boats floating by on the river. Plus, as you walk from the lobby to the pool or towers, you get to see some amazing artwork throughout the passageways. The hotel has spent something like 7 million dollars on artwork, and it shows. There are giant marble statues of the Chinese zodiac characters (each 12 feet tall) around the pools. There are huge Buddhas around the property, and artifacts from Polynesian culture. The artwork is Asian in descent, and much of it extremely realistic reproductions. You can even ask one of the concierges for the Artwork guidebook, to use as a guide if you wish. I swear, this stuff blew us away. It made strolling through the resort a lot of fun.  There are three Towers at this resort. On the left, you have the Lagoon Tower, where the huge pool, slide, and waterfall exist. It's also near the shops, and a couple of good restaurants. The Dolphin Quest is close to this one as well. I found this tower to be a bit more crowded than the other 2. In the middle, you have the Palace Tower, which is where we stayed. It's close to 3 main restaurants, as well as a 2 minute walk to the Ocean Tower (the hotel on the right), and the pools next to that. These pools are staggered along the ocean, and look out onto the Pacific. No beach here, but instead you look out to waves crashing on lava rocks. The pools on this side were never crowded (sometimes being completely empty), and had several slides for the kids to use. There was waiter service to get drinks and food at the pool, or you could use the nearby restaurants. The Ocean Tower is the final tower, and looked huge. They had their own pool, and also housed the Executive Lounge, which we took advantage of each morning. Being a Hilton Diamond member, I was offered the choice of the the breakfast buffet at the Ocean tower restaurant, or the Executive Lounge. I chose the latter, and was happy I did. The buffet didn't seem that great, and could get crowded as the morning got moving. The lounge had a nice selection of coffee, teas, hot cocoa, orange and guava juice, passion fruit yoghurt, lots of fresh fruit, pastries, bagels/toast/english muffins, and more. I never made it up there for the afternoon cookies/snacks, or the 5-7pm appetizers. Access on the Executive Club also gives you 50% off on Tennis court fees (these courts are AMAZING by the way, one even has stadium seating!!), and complimentary access to the Sports Club and Spa (also amazing, with a lava rock hot tub in each locker room).  Restaurants: I ate at Kirin (Chinese), Imari (Japanese), and the Orchid Cafe by the lagoon pool. Tried to eat at the Provision company, but they wouldn't reserve an outdoor table, so I passed. All of the places we ate were wonderful. Yes, they were bit pricey, but none more than a nice downtown restaurant in a major city. I would highly recommend the Dim Sum lunch at Kirin. Sit outside too! Prices for Dim Sum were all in the $4 range, and we had all kinds of dumplings, buns, rolls, rice, etc.  At Imari, I was amazed to have the sushi chef tell me that they had Chutoro (not Toro, not regular ahi, but this is a medium fatty tuna that is very very tough to find). I had the bento box, and it was so much food (including desert) that I left stuffed. The mirin/miso marinated and broiled black cod was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I thought it tasted just like Nobu's, which was perfect.  At the Orchid Cafe, we got there late, and ordered a few of their homemade wood fired pizzas. The chef was kind enough to custom make ours off the menu, and we sat by the waterfall and ate them outside. You couldn't have asked for a better night. Now, the room. We did get upgraded to a suite, and that was unbelievable. Seriously, this thing was HUGE. It had 6 balconies. If you can swing it, I would highly recommend trying ti upgrade. I did get to see the \"normal\" rooms as well, and I thought they were perfect. The furnishings are high quality wood, with small pineapple accents on them. The beds were more than comfortable, and the bathroom was marble with nice amenities. These rooms were perfect.  Hmmm, what else? OH, we took the timeshare tour, and got the $100. They were offering a few freebies you could choose from: A luau for two people, a round of golf, or the $100 Hilton dollars (and these come in 4 $25 slips of paper that must be spent in gift shops or within the hotel, and NO change is given) They cannot be used towards your hotel bill. The tour was nice, and the gal who helped us, MJ, was kind and informative. Even when we expressed that we weren't interested, she kept her smile. It wasn't a heavy sell like some timeshares, and although pricey we thought, it could be good for some people. As for driving around, I would recommend the valet parking. It's just easier. $21 a night was pricey for Hawaii (Heck, the Four Seasons is only $15 a night), but then again, where I'm from, overnight hotel parking is just about $50.  There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby (the Kings and Queens shops), and we visited a lot of them. We rented a car and drove up North, to the Volcano, to Hilo, and to Kona. LOTS to do and see. I could go on and on..... This hotel was absolutely perfect. We loved it. So will you. ", " We stayed as guests invited to examine the time-shares. We had dreaded the experience of dealing with high pressure sales -- but could not resist the great bargain we obtained by agreeing to listen for 90 minutes. The sales folks were actually quite nice, and the tour and talk was almost pleasant.The facility itself is very nice - and in fact was quite sparsely occupied judging by the low number of other quests we encountered and the lack of cars in the parking lot.We only ate on site twice, and both times the view was superior to the food. The prices are high, but we found this to be true on most of the big island.We found the Waikoloa to be a handy home base for exploring the island. It is close to the great Blue Hawaiian helicopter rides and allowed us to make day trips to most destinations. We did stay one night on the other side of the island so that we could do a clockwise circumnavigation.All in all this is a very nice property. ", " I registered and account to defend this resort!!! This is the MOST BEAUTIFUL resort I have been to, I loved it so much I have been there 4 times!! Yes it's expensive. The food prices are not cheap but it's hawaii. We knew this already. This is a great place if you are looking for relaxation and a beautiful atmosphere. They do have a bar lounge on site also. You will not be let down! ", " We stayed in the lagoon tower on the first floor. We had originally booked a room that had a view of the dolphin area with a partial view of the lagoon but they told us that they had to change our room and upgraded it with this one - with 16 hours of travel to get here, we just accepted it and went to bed. When we woke up the next morning and opened the shades, we were so glad that we had the room change. We could see the ocean, the palm trees swaying, and some of the pool. Our room was large, clean, and we were happy with it. Although I would have liked a microwave in the room, but there was a fridge. The resort itself is very large. We spent the first day walking through the entire place to see what they had to offer. It is beautiful! The people that work there are very friendly and hospitable. Our package came with the breakfast buffet and every morning we looked forward to eating there. We spent some time in the pool and the lagoon which had the sea turtles that my husband loved swimming with. There were other pools, but we spent most of our time at the one near the lagoon tower. We ordered room service once - my husband ordered the fish which he enjoyed (not as much as the breakfast) and I ordered the veggie pizza which was just ok. Like other posters have mentioned, we bought much of our snack food at the Queens market which is a little pricy, but was good, located near the hotel, and helped with the midnight munchies. The hotel itself is kind of far from other places, but we rented a jeep (a must have if you are going to go off road) so this was not an issue for us.My only comment would be the option to go in and out of your hotel room through the sliding glass doors (for those who have ground floor rooms) and be able to lock it from the outside - it would have been very convenient to go in and out of the sliding glass doors as opposed to having to go through the hotel to get to the pool which was right outside our door. Also, they should remove the parking fee - the price of the hotel should cover that.The hotel was great and we would definitely stay here again. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort June 19-27, 2008. Overall we had a great time and I high recommend the resort. The location was beautiful, the rooms were well appointed, great ocean views, beautiful grounds, courteous staff. The lagoon on the grounds is a fun place to swim, snorkel and just lay around. However, if you're looking for a sandy beach, you must either take the shuttle or walk next door. With 65 acres, the grounds are gorgeous. The only negatives were the extremely overpriced food and drink ($4.50 for a cup of pineapple juice, $10 for a hamburger), and the distance you must travel to see the rest of the island. A rental car id definitely recommended. If you are staying here, the Dolphin encounter id really worth the money. My wife and daughter LOVED it, describing the dolphins and surfing as their two favorite memories. The resort's luau is also not bad; just make sure to get the reserved seating. The pools at the resort are also pretty awesome! ", " This was a fine place to stay....don't pay attention to complaints about long walking distances or the remote location of the site. The walking distances aren't long and the location of the resort shouldn't be a surprise to you. The \"train\" literally moves at about 3 mph. You can walk 2x faster than it moves. We took it once just for a laugh!I'm also puzzled by complaints about food and drink prices. Yes, they're high. You're at a resort, in Hawaii. But I didn't think they were higher than one would expect for such a setting.We used this as a home-base for our 3 days on the island. We covered the island from north to south, east to west. This location was great as a base of operations.We stayed in the Lagoon tower and we could see the dolphin pool from our room. The views were nice. I agree with another reviewer who said to be sure to go snorkeling in the lagoon. You'll see a lot of sea life in a small area. The turtles are curious and will probably swim right up to you to check you out! Pretty cool!We hit a few of the restaurants on-site and have no complaints. The food and the service was very good. We enjoyed it here, and I think we'd consider this property if we ever visit again.One last thing; we did Dolphin Quest and had a blast! Yes, it's expensive, but when are you going to swim with a dolphin again? You only live once. ", " We arrived on the Big Island for our annual vacation in April with the expectation of clear skies, sunny afternoons and time to relax with friends in the quaint town of Kona. To our surprise and dismay the southwestern communities were smothered with a carpet of volcanic smog from the latest and ongoing eruptions of the Kiluaea volcano. The air was toxic with elevated amounts of sulfur dioxide gas that burned the eyes and irritated our sinuses. Occasionally visibility was reduced to the point that headlights were required for safety when driving through town at noon. Seeking relief we contacted the Hilton about 30 miles north of Kona and immediately booked accommodations for the balance of our vacation. The Hilton resort was everything we were looking for in our Hawaiian vacation. Clear skies, extensive resort amenities, clean rooms, cheerful staff and a great price. Yes there is a Disneyland feel to the resort with the tram, canal boats, Dolphin Quest and expansive grounds but absent the crowds the venue provided variety, convenience and relaxation. At no time did we have to wait in line for anything as the resort was about 50% occupied. Observation: Locals and staff members told me tourism is way down from prior years with the increase in fuel costs to fly to Hawaii coupled with all of the bad press regarding the VOG. That said, the resort is located in an area that is VOG free and given the deep discounts the Hilton is providing to guests the savings more than offsets the increased airfares. If you are going to the Big Island, definitely consider staying on the northwest side and give strong consideration to the Hilton - you will not be disappointed.Ken Stempson ", " Just returned from a vacation to the Big Island (6-6 through 6-14). We had stayed at the Hilton at this time in 2006 and loved it so much that we decided to invite family to stay with us this year. We had a marvelous stay here again. As noted above, we were not disappointed in any portion of our trip. As I warned my family before we went and am stating for anyone who is reading this post\u2013this property is HUGE. Please don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that it really can\u2019t be that big. Regardless of how big it is we walked almost constantly around the grounds. However, when we rode the trams or boats we never waited more than 5 minutes. We did hit a snag in that our air conditioning unit was leaking into our room. The front desk was quite helpful and was willing to move us to a new room should we want. But our view was so nice we decided not to move. Within 5 minutes of calling, maintenance was at our door to fix the problem. Within another five minutes another maintenance worker was there to shampoo our rug. The whole process took no more than 30 minutes out of our time. Service from the front desk, restaurants, maintenance, housekeeping, bell was nothing but friendly and done efficiently. Food is pricey at the hotel but hey, its pricey everywhere. We did find that the food court was slightly cheaper but not that much. After day 2 we were already tired of eating there and found other places in the resort and around the island to eat.Had a great several days swimming at Hapuna Beach just north of the hotel. Vog was present in Kona when we went there but did not affect my husband who has asthma. We love this hotel and what's not to love about Hawaii. We will return again and would highly recommend it. ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for 5 nights and we loved it! I believe they said the property is celebrating their 20th anniversary. It has been well maintained and is still a lovely place to visit.We stayed in the Ocean Tower which is farthest away from the lobby. It is about a 15 minute stroll to the room. The monorail and boat do come by quite often. When you arrive at the property they whisk your luggage away and you get it about 30 minutes later at your room. Remember when checking out to give them 1 hour to pick up your luggage before you need to leave the hotel.The rooms are very big and the tropical decor is as expected. The double beds are on the small side. The work area is very nice. It was $39.99 for 3 days of internet service. It seems pricey, but if you are using the internet you should be there for work and expensing it. Hopefully if you are paying on your own...you are relaxing and didn't bring your laptop. :)The room had a very big walk-in closet. There were two refrigerators (not stocked, but nice place to put your own drinks.) There is also a safe that easily accommodates your laptop, jewelry, etc. and it is free of charge. The bathroom area is very big and nice for people that are sharing space. They also provide coffee and tea.The hotel stocks some of the typical Hilton Le Source products and some of their signature cocoa mango products. They are happy to bring you lots of towels. It is humid there and the towels don't dry out very quickly.The balcony is obviously lovely and overlooks the ocean. Our particular room was just above the putting green. The rooms are well maintained and our housekeeping service was stellar.The property does not have a typical \"hawaiian beach\" access. The lagoon is ocean water. The lagoon has plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. This is also where you will find lots of water toys. We found their were lots of children in this area.The big pool has lots of waterfalls, the waterside, etc. It is very pretty. There are plenty of places to be in and out of the sun. The medium size pool near the Ocean Tower also has the lazy river and smaller waterslides. They also have cabanas that can be rented for $80/day. There is a small adults only pool by near the boat dock for the Ocean Towers. It is a little disappointing compared to the other pools...but it there if you like. My only suggestion for the hotel would be a nicer \"adults only\" area.The property is so big that you never really feel crowded. I think it was at 80% capacity when we were there and you would not have known it.The dolphins are great. You can eat lunch overlooking their area and it is lots of fun. I don't think you have to spend the money on the dolphin experience to feel like you \"saw the dolphins\"...although the experience does look fun.The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport. It is about 20 minutes to downtown Kona. It is about a 2 to 2 1/2 hour drive to Hilo.The restaurants at the hotel are all good. We especially enjoyed the Japanese restaurant and the Kamuela Provision Company. This is their restaurant that overlooks the water. We had dinner at 5:30PM to ensure an outdoor table and it is well worth it.The spa at the hotel is very nice. There is a nice lava rock jacuzzi area that is half indoor and half outdoor where you can relax between treatments. The eucalyptus steam room was very clean. I recommend their signature baths. The rooms are sort of open to the outside and I found it really relaxing. The staff in the spa were all very nice and efficient. My massage was well worth the price.We loved this hotel. It is great for families. There is lots to do or you can just relax. The only thing I would say is that if your looking for a hotel where you can walk out of your room onto a sandy beach with waves...this isn't the place for you. However, if you are a pool person...you will love it. ", " After reading all of the negative reviews of this hotel, I had to write about my experience. My husband and I just returned two days ago from the Hilton. We had a wonderful time. The grounds of the property are beautiful and they keep it so clean. And yes, it is a really big hotel. But the walking is not bad at all--in fact it is really good exercise. We never once took the boats or tram to get us around the property. However, I have to say, I constantly saw boats and trams picking people up and there didn't appear to be that long of a wait . We stayed in the Ocean Tower and granted it is a little far from the lobby and the parking, but we never felt that it was an undoable walk. Our room was really nice and kept very clean. We had a golf course view but were lucky in that you could see the ocean from our room. We parked in the self-park every day and I maybe saw three or four cats in the parking lot. The food prices were what is to be expected at a hotel in Hawaii. I didn't think they were outrageous at all and the food is really good. We loved the breakfast; we never had the buffet and would just order a la carte from the menu. The pancakes are delicious!! We typically would have a bigger breakfast (running us around $35) and then just share something at lunch. We rarely ever ate dinner at the hotel with there being so many good restaurants in the area. Because the hotel is so big, we never felt crowded or that there were too many people. The staff were all very friendly. We would definitely stay at the Hilton again. This was our first trip to the Big Island--we've been to Maui and Kauai before. We have stayed in highly rated hotels on both of those islands and the Hilton definitely is as nice as if not nicer than those hotels. The Big Island is now our favorite of the Hawaiian islands we've visited and we can't wait to go back again. ", " Our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa was definitely a grand vacation! We have stayed at the other Hilton timeshares (all of which were great), and the Hilton Waikoloa was definitely the best. The resort is very big which is the reason why they have the tram and boat to help guests move from one area of the hotel to the other. It's situated next to the water, although it is very rocky on the shore. It houses the famous Dolphin Quest experience, so if you're looking to swim with dolphins (I think I counted 10) this is the place to do it (for a price of course). The pool area is amazing. It has a sandy beach, waterfall, bridges, and a water slide. They also have a lagoon for paddle boats,....Of course there is a spa and gym onsite while although you do have to pay a fee, they do offer at least 2 fitness classes/day for free so check the schedule. My favorite class was the outdoor circuit training since you were able to workout outdoors and see the amenities the resort had to offer (not to mention that the class was very challenging). There are 2 public beaches nearby which were both great (clear blue water). The one right next to the resort is great for kayaking, boating,....The one north of the hotel was my favorite since it was great for boogie boarding. I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone staying at the big island. MAHALO! ", " Hilton Waikoloa is a beautiful hotel. My husband and i arrived late on our first night but when we woke up the next morning, the Hilton Waikoloa did NOT disappoint!!!!! With 64 acres it has everything you need for relaxation and just getting away! Our room was on Buddha Point so we were able to enjoy a week's worth of GORGEOUS sun sets but also wake up to the sounds of waves crashing against the lava rocks!! This place is HUGE!! There are 5-6 different locations your room could be at but don't worry....they have a tram that runs every couple of minutes to take you to different parts of the hotel if you don't feel like walking. They also have a boat tram for a different scenery but it was under construction while we were there, so you'll have to let me know how that goes!! ;) They have their own lagoon where you can snorkel and swim with turtles!! That was the highlight of my snorkeling. In that lagoon you also have the option to paddle-board, kayak, peddle board and with snorkeling, venture out into the bay to see more fish, eels, & turtles!! They also have their dolphin quest where you can jump in the water with dolphins & interact with them. Have lunch at the lagoon grill because I think that was our cheapest meal there!!! Haha Can't beat a good Burger & onion rings!! Eating in the resort was pretty pricey but they do have the King's & Queen's shops just down he road so we would just take the trolley for $2 and eat somewhere different each time. The luau was a little pricey, but we enjoyed the food & open bar a lot & the show is always entertaining!! I think this hotel would be perfect if you just wanted to stay at the resort. My hubby & I ended up renting a car so we could drive to our excursions which included the volcano helicopter tour, ziplining, volcanos national park, waterfalls and the only downside was that these things were on the other side of the island which was a 2 hour drive EACH way. We did this drive 3 days in a row and by the 3rd day...we were tired of driving it. So maybe the only thing that would've made this trip perfect would be for everything to be on one side of the island....but it was worth it!!But this resort is beautiful and was able to find such a great deal on it!!! $1005/pp for a WEEK!!! Can't beat it!!! Hope this helps!! Aloha!!! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a wonderful. We stayed in the ocean tower on the 6th floor and had a fantastic view of the ocean. The big island is interesting in that the Kona side is mostly lava rock. If you scuba dive you must do the night dive with the manta rays. It is one of the best scuba dives in the world. Because the cost of taking a helicopter from Waikoloa was expensive we drove to Helo and took a helicopter tour of the volcano, which is another must see while on the island. Kona Brewing company is also a fun place. Take the brewery tour. ", " What a Great place to stay. 62 acers of paradise.We stayed for 10 days and I had a grin on my face 10 minutes after I got there and it never left my face until my flight in Honolulu was late going home.The room was up to date,clean and comfortable. We had a wonderful veiw of the ocean and golf course from the 5th floor of the Ocean Tower. We enjoyed the walk from the main lobby to our room,the polynesien art work was fabulous to look at, finding new items almost every day, it made the walk more like a treasurer hunt. There is a tram and boats that also run untill 12 midnight.The lagoon that is on the property was great, swimming with the sea turtles,was priceless,the dolphin quest is out in the open to watch and enjoy without charge.The different colored fish and eels were too numeous to count.There are pools that meander along at both ends of the hotel. Many different restaurants that are on site as well as others that are a short walk (approx. 3/4 mile each way) or a $2.00 Shuttle ride to get to them. There are a number of shops that are on the property,also National rental car, the better to go see the Big Island. The Luau at the Hilton Was a wonderfull dinner and show (get the up grade for $26.00 its well worth the price for the free drinks and cocktails). Be sure to brush up on your ALOHA, you here it from all of the staff a long with a warm smile.It is pricey...BUT...it is Hawaii, and it is a great resort. Over all we had a really Great time and would go back anytime. ", " I have been to this Hilton 5 times now. I guess you could say we LOVE this place! I love everything about this place, the people, the pools, the monorail, the boat rides, the dolphins, the food, I could go on and on and on....We stayed for 8 nights this time. First let me say, those who are new to traveling to Hawaii be warned that this hotel is a good 30 to 45 minutes from the Kona airport. We love the drive though, you get to see/read peoples messages they leave on the lava rock with white sea shells. Renting a car is easy at the Kona airport, they go out of their way to make you happy. Be aware that gas is obviously high in Hawaii since it is an island. Gas when we left was around 4.12 a gallon.This side of the big island is the desert side. You will think on your drive to this resort that you picked the wrong island, but trust me the Kona area is the best kept secret. We have been to every island and we seriously enjoy the Kona area the most.The hilton is amazing. It is a HUGE property with multiple towers of guest rooms. There is a monorail which takes you around the property due to how big it is. We got the basic room, just because we use our room to sleep in. Our room was clean, and we found nothing to complain about. Room service was awesome! By the time we got done with our buffet every morning our room was cleaned. As far as the view from the room? The view is not a big deal to us. Another cool thing about this resort? A lot of celebrities like it. Last time we were here Cameron Diaz was here with some friends and this time Nicholas Cage was here with his family. It was cool to see/meet him, he was extremely nice and his family and him blended in like normal. One of our waiters at a restaraunt told us celebrities like coming here because it so big they can blend in easily.There is also a boat which you can use other then the monorail. The boat is fun for a couple of times but it is slow and if your in a hurry to get somewhere it could be a pain. You can always walk, but it takes a long time and it could be a far distance.The best thing about this hotel? 1. The pools. They have a HUGE pool with HUGE waterfalls. The waterslide at this resort is by far the best waterslide at any resort I have stayed at. They have multiple pools, and the water temp. was just right on cool nights. They also have hot tubs.The only thing I would say is a downfall about the pool is they close it to early, however it is an open style pool (with no fences or gates around it) so we saw people in it as late as 2 AM however there is no towel service this late.2. The lagoon. You dont have to leave this resort to go snorkeling. They have their own lagoon which feeds from the ocean so it is constantly getting new fish, turtles, and other types of marine wildlife. We snorkeled here 3 times and each time we saw something different and new. The sea turtles here will let you touch them from what we heard from another guest. I think you can get into legal trouble in Hawaii if you do touch them though. We never got close enough to try.3. Food. This resort has great food. The buffet breakfast is by far one of the best buffets you will find anywhere in Hawaii for the price. It reminds me of a Vegas buffet but better. The food is a little pricey, but it is good. We did hear some colleagues complain about the food, so we dont know if we were just so hungry due to the fact we were constantly doing something or what. But we seriously liked the food and the restraunts here.4. Dolphins. This resort has a dolphin aquarium on site. You can pay to swim with the dolphins and take pictures. The price to do this isn't that bad compared to what I have seen at other resorts. We paid it, had a blast and when people see the pictures of us with the dolphins they cant get over them. If you dont wanna pay to swim with the dolphins then you can watch them 24 hours a day as the swim, jump and eat. There is a baby dolphin that was born a while back. It is cool to see how active and how much energy it has being so young.5. Price. I think this hotel is right on target when it comes to price. If you sit back and calculate everything you get at this resort and the benefits, it is a good deal. This time around we took vacation here with some colleagues and friends of ours. No one ever complained about the prices our budget. Kept in mind Hawaii is an island and things can get expensive.The only downside to this hotel: no sandy beach, I love to surf and body board. This hotel has no sandy beach. There is a beach about 1 mile from here that has decent waves and great sand. Overall this was a awesome time. I love Hawaii so much. I have been to Fiji, Bahams, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Florida, and Costa Rica and I think Hawaii is still the best. Another good thing about this hotel is it is so wide open you never feel overcrowded like some resorts in Mexico and the Bahamas. The hotel told us they were at at 93 percent capacity when we checked in and if they never would of told us that I would of said the hotel was probably at 30 percent capacity.Rent a car and go to Kona. Kona is awesome, lots of bars and restaraunts on the board walk. There is also a new international market in Kona which is good to shop at. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village was a beautiful resort and I was very impressed throughout my 7 day stay. The resort is huge and everything is very clean and neat. My room was big and roomy. Service was good. Highly recommended. ", " What a wonderful time we had. Yes the hotel is big and things are expensive but everything else was great. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower on the 5th floor just overlooking the Dolphin habitat. What a treat to be able to watch the dolphins early in the morning and the trainer feed them too. There were 2 babies and the trainers were more than willing to answer any questions. The 2nd real treat was the lagoon, we got to swim with the turles.The rooms were nice we had 4 people in our room and we had plenty of space. We went into town to eat dinner a couple of times and we did go to Kmart when we left the airport and bought stuff for the week. That really helped. We would most defintiely go back!! ", " I agree with one other review recently done and feel I must add my own review of our recent stay at this property. My husband, myself and our two children ages 12 and 11 had an absolutely wonderful stay at this hotel. We arrived on March 22nd (late arrival) and stayed 6 nights. There must not have been any conventions going on, due to the Easter holiday, during our stay because the resort never felt crowded to us at any time. The staff on the trams, boats, front desk, and restaurant staff were all pleasant and friendly. The trams do have stands at their many stops which will tell you how many minutes it will be before the next one arrives. I never saw the wait times greater than 8 minutes and many times it arrived at our tower as we were leaving to go somewhere. The boats were a very pleasant ride to any destination on the resort. If you are on a strict time schedule and do not want to wait for the available transportation, we found it a little shorter/faster to walk through the 'center' garden walkways to our destinations rather than to walk along the art walk hallways (which btw is past flamingoes and georgous gardens). Our room was in the palace tower, and had a view of the golf course. I rarely heard any birds in the morning but nothing I would consider annoying by any means. THE ONLY negative of our stay was that unfortunately I did see two cockroaches near the coffeemaker and that was disappointing. We rented a car and did eat some meals elsewhere, but the Sunday brunch at Kameuela Provision Company was fantastic! As we sat down at our table overlooking the ocean we saw a mother whale and her baby right in front of us! Beautiful ocean views from that restaurant. The pools are beautiful and we had no trouble getting towels. We did use self parking to save some money but it definitely is necessary to use bellservice to get your luggage to your rooms. That worked out well for us. And some suggestions to bring as snacks help keep down the cost of meals. We brought our oun coffee filters and coffee to avoid the charge by the hotel to use their coffee. But you can use the coffee maker to make ramen noodles, tea, oatmeal, and other snacks. The in room fridge came in handy too.People who have complained about housekeeping may not have noticed the little card on the nightstand which states if you want towels replaced just leave the dirty ones on the floor and they will replace them, also the little card must be placed on your bed in order to have the sheets changed. Not difficult to do, and we had no housekeeping problems. If you want a peaceful, calm and relaxing stay at a Hawaiian resort this would be my first pick by a longshot! We really enjoyed our stay and hated to leave. ", " My husband and I stayed at the Waikoloa Village for 8 nights through our Hilton Honors Points and it was the best vacation yet, and we've had some great ones. The resort is beautiful, our room was comfortable and clean (we asked to have our room changed to the Ocean Tower and they accomodated our request with an ocean view room). It is off season, the hotel was only 1/3 full and from what we heard the economy is really struggling like everywhere else. We read all the negative reviews prior to going, and were somewhat nervous, but once we arrived, and were greeted by a delightful young lady that accomodated all of our check in needs our minds were put to rest. All of the employees we came across were friendly, hospitable and more than helpful. The shuttle and boats were both working, yes, somewhat slow, but we were on vacation and had no timeframes to meet. We enjoyed riding on both, it was relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. We only spent one full day at the resort, we were so busy seeing the island, discovering tucked away beaches, small towns and enjoying the fantastic snorkeling. As a Hilton Gold Member we had access to the \"hilton executive lounge area\" that gave us a free continental breakfast, snacks during the day and a happy hour (reduced prices) in the evening. We ate one meal at the resort, at the provision company on our last evening which was actually very good, we had 2 drinks ($11.50 martinis) our entire stay at the resort. Arriving in Kona, we bought a styrofoam cooler at K-mart, beer, wine and the mixings for margaritas, that took care of us for the week. Gas is $4.00/gallon, we had a costco card and the gas there was $3.80. We ate at some great restaurants, The Fish Hopper-kona, Huggos-great caesar salad with fresh ono, Merriman's (at the King Shops) and the restaurant at the golf course across the street that serves tappas. There is a a new restaurant in Waimea? called Huli Sue's, we had a great pulled pork lunch with some local brew, reasonably priced and delicious. There is also a marina about 2 miles from the airport that has the coldest, biggest, cheapest beer on the island. The food isn't bad either, all local fishermen/women coming in for a cold one after a long day. very interesting group! Overall, our trip was fantastic, we made the most of the time we were there, enjoyed every minute of every day and are anxious to book our next hilton vacation, next time in maui. Take advantage of this resort, it is well worth the trip. Relaxe, and take the resort for what is has to offer, nothing is perfect, but this is close to it! ", " My wife booked this trip for us as a surprise for our 10th anniversary. It was far better than any all trip I have ever had. The hotel had every amenity i could think of. I day trade stocks and I had reliable internet service. The hotel had 5 restaurants to satisfy any palate. I ate at only 2/5 - the food was great and service was good as well. The hotel also had a car rental service which came in useful. If one is looking for a inexpensive place to stay/eat this hotel is not it. ", " I'll admit it is hard to write a review for this resort because of the many, many reviews listed on this site. But I had to write to try to raise the rating for this resort, because it was absolutely fabulous for our honeymoon over Christmas.Check-in: Our check-in was very smooth. Valets were very friendly and so was the front desk clerk. Actually, ironically enough, he was also from Wisconsin. He did a great job explaining the layout of the resort and we got to our room without trouble. They also had our bags waiting for us the next morning since the airline lost it on the way over.Resort Grounds: Spectacular! I will acknowledge the other reviewers here by saying that the resort is huge! Easily a 30 minute walk across the grouds. Watching the dolphins was really fun. The pools are beautiful and the water slide is a lot of fun. Yes, the pool was very cold, but if it is hot outside who cares! The hot tubs were very nice after walking for a long day. The lagoon beach on the resort is not a traditional Hawaiian beach (it is man-made), but the sand is soft and it is a nice calm place to enter the ocean. Snorkeling here is pretty fun as well. We saw turtles and lots of fish. It is good to get there early in the day though, because people will stir up the sand and add about an inch of sunscreen to the top of the water. There was some construction when we were there (around the lagoon pool and dolphin area), but it was never intrusive.Room: Our room was everything that I expected and more. We reserved a mountain view room and received one in the Ocean Tower. Great balcony view on the 7th floor. As with a lot of hotels you can hear most of the people that walk by and yes the birds will definitely start squaking at about 5-6 AM. Bring earplugs if it bothers you, otherwise go to back to bed, they will stop eventually. Bed was very comfortable and the room was quite spacious. No bugs or any problems.Beach: The lagoon beach is fine, but the real beach is A-bay. A-bay is located about a 1/2 mile to a mile away. If you follow the path along the ocean by the lagoon tower/pool you'll eventually come to A-bay. The path is somewhat rocky, so flip-flops would not be recommended. The sand here is very soft and the waves were perfect. There is also a couple small coral reefs off the shore that can easily be swam to. You can also walk some paths out the front lobby and down the road, but the ocean walk is much prettier.Restaurants: We ate at couple of the restaurants during our stay. Donatoni's was fabulous (you can read my review for further details), the dock cafe served lots of good snacky type food, as well as a sushi bar. Overall the food was very expensive, but that is expected at a resort in Hawaii.Activities: Mini-golf is pretty fun. We did the glow golf which is a couple nights a week. They put glow sticks inside the golf balls and it is pretty challenging. Outragouesly priced, but still fun. Redsail sports has ton of fun things to rent. We went snorkeling a couple of times and was pretty reasonably priced.In summary it was a large resort, but that meant only more room for beautiful grounds, great restaurants and fun activities. ", " We were a bit apprehensive about staying here as the descriptions of monorails, \"Disney style boats\" and reports of dolphins onsite made us quite wary (we normally prefer places that are more intimate and/or with fewer commercialized attributes), but we were most pleasantly surprised to find that although the place was certainly Disney-enough for children and families, it had many things to appeal to grown ups - even those without children. Despite what you'll read here, the place is very walkable - and that's half the fun. There are sculptures, tapestries, paintings and other assorted pieces of art throughout the resort and the views of the ocean and mountain are most impressive. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and gave us a bunch of tips about must-see hidden gems on the island. Things were quite expensive, although normally not of poor quality so you felt as if you were splurging a bit, but not being taken for a ride, so to speak.The hotel luau provided a good show and only acceptable food, but snorkling in the lagoon was a real treat, as were evening strolls on pathways lit by tiki torches. We were there for five nights and would go back in a heartbeat. ", " This resort has so many things to do, you will not need to plan any extra activities. We were there for 4 days and could not get everything done. The grounds are well kept, and the boat and train runs often to get you around to the different areas of the hotel grounds. There are several different restaurants to choose from to fit everyone's fancy. If we ever go back to the big Island, we will stay there! ", " I planned a surprise trip for my hubby for his bday. He knew he was going somewhere and the dates but no idea on the location. We went to Hawaii for 2 weeks. Started out in Oahu then over to Maui and this was our final destination. Obviously, we saved the best for last. It was a fantastic resort. It is quite large so you have to take a boat or tram to your room! Room was beautiful and clean. Views were spectacular. Chinese restaurant that we frequently regularly was awesome. Little expensive but then again, everything is in Hawaii. Book early for the dolphin experience. Staff were quite friendly and helpful with any and all requests. ", " My husband, 14 year old daughter and I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort. It was our first visit to Hawaii, and we wanted to stay at a nice place where we could relax and soak up the sun. The resort was the perfect spot for us to unwind and get away from the winter weather.The place is huge - there are three towers, three major swimming areas, and several shops and restaurants. Tram and boat service are available, although the walk is quite enjoyable as well - there is a lot of beautiful art to look at on the walkway between the palace and ocean towers. The boat was slower than the tram, but much more pleasant.We stayed in the ocean tower in a double room with a lanai and an ocean view. The room was tastefully decorated with a tropical theme, and also had a couch, desk, mini-refrigerator, iron, hair dryer, coffee maker, and lots of drawers. The Kohala Spa products that were provided were very nice, but the coffee was awful (we bought our own supply on the 2nd day). I'd give it an 8 out of 10 on the cleanliness scale - everything was tidy and neat, but there was a lot of grime in the corners (especially noticeable on the bathroom floor), and I found a couple of items that weren't ours under the bed and behind the couch.We visited February 23 through March 1, and we didn't find the resort to be crowded. This was a very good thing, as we rarely had to wait long to be seated in any of the restaurants, and never had any trouble finding chairs by any of the pools or the lagoon. The food was overpriced, but was always tasty. We especially enjoyed our dinners at Imari (great service) and the Kamuela Provision Company (great food, and we were practically on the beach).Because the room had a small refrigerator and we'd brought a collapsible cooler with us, we saved a bit of money by purchasing some water, fruit, snacks, and wine at a nearby supermarket. My husband played tennis several times during his stay, and really enjoyed it (he plays quite a lot at home). He and my daughter also did the morning kayaking excursion with Red Sail Sports, and had a great time. My daughter did the Dolphin Quest Experience, and she found it amazing to be able to touch the dolphin and feel like she was communicating with him. I do hope that they give the dolphins free run of the lagoon during the evening though, since they don't seem to have much room to swim around in the area that they have reserved for the activities.The swimming pools are fantastic. The Kona Pool has a waterfall, slide, and several hot tubs scattered throughout. There's also a man-made lagoon where you can rent all sorts of non-motorized equipment and explore the lagoon (a turtle swam by while I was in there). My favorite was the Kohala Pool, which is near the Ocean Tower. It's a long, narrow pool which winds like a river. There were statues all around this pool from the Chinese Zodiac, and you could also rent cabanas.We decided to use the valet parking, since it seemed pretty miserly to worry about this small expense considering what we were paying for the room and food. For the $7 plus tip difference, it was worth not having to do the extra walking to the self-parking lot. The valets were pretty quick for the most part.There were a lot of other special extras that I really enjoyed about this hotel, including the birds that were occasionally in the lobby. My daughter and I took a complementary hula lesson, which was a laugh! The instructor was very patient, and we had a lot of fun.Other than the prices, I had only one real issue with this resort. We got a call when we arrived inviting us to an orientation meeting the next morning. We thought this sounded great, since it is a pretty big place. We arrived a little late, not knowing how to time the tram connections yet. We approached the Hilton Grand Vacations Resort desk to ask about the meeting, and the gentlemen offered to help us since the meeting was already underway. After telling us that we should change our prepaid helicopter tour for something else (gee, that's helpful), he made his pitch for us to take a tour of the Hilton Grand Vacation Club. We've done this sort of thing before, and it's always high pressure, and always takes longer than promised. I wanted nothing to do with it, and once we made that clear the charming fellow's manner changed abruptly, and not in a good way. He became quite rude and a bit insulting. Obviously we made the right call in not agreeing to attend their presentation considering his Jekyl and Hyde behavior.I would highly recommend this hotel if you plan to spend a lot of time there enjoying the amenities. Between the pool, tennis, golf, water activities, spa, complementary lessons, shopping, walking, and dining, the resort has a lot to offer. The three of us have very different ideas of what makes a vacation great, and we all loved staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. ", " I read all of the reviews on this site and others before deciding to book a room at the Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort. Since this trip was just for my husband and I, I was a little leery about the \"Disneyland\" atmosphere and the possible abundance of little children running everywhere. However, we had an extremely pleasant stay at the Hilton for all five nights.Yes, your hotel room may be located within a long walk/tram ride from the lobby. But really, is it going to kill you to take a 20 minute walk!? I really was shocked to see how easy and pleasant it was to walk to/from our room after reading so many complaints on this site about the distance. My philosophy was that the extra walking allowed me to have another drink at the bar or some ice cream after dinner. If you are not interested in getting exercise from a short walk, the trams do run frequently and we never saw anyone waiting very long to catch one. And if you're standing, waiting for the tram for more than 5-10 minutes, you probably just should have walked the distance instead!Our room was located in the Palace Tower and it faced the small garden that falls between the Palace and Ocean Towers. We could just barely see the water from our balcony. The room was standard hotel room size, however the bed was positioned on an angle, so it seemed very roomy. We also had a small loveseat and a table with 2 chairs. The bathroom was divided between an open sink area with a large counter and a separate tub/shower/toilet room that was quite small. We also had a very large walk-in closet that held our small refrigerator and safe. There was an additional fridge that once was used for the mini-bar that the hotel no longer provides. We used this one for storage of dry goods (cereal, bread, etc) because it never got cold enough to cool any drinks or other foods down. We had a nice balcony that had two chairs and a small table just off of the room, which we used frequently. Although I have never stayed in either the Ocean or Lagoon Towers, I was very happy with how quiet the Palace Tower seemed. Every once and a while you could hear a child crying or the balcony door opening in the room above, but it was very quiet overall. We were never disturbed by any noises or any other guests.The parking cost for self-parking was $14 a day, which seemed very in tune with the other resorts in the area. We never had any trouble finding a parking spot and the walk to/from the car was not unreasonable at all.We did the kayaking trip with Red Sail Sports that leaves from the property and would highly recommend it to anyone. It was about $61.00 and involved paddling a kayak out to a black sand beach where we snorkeled for about an hour. Because no one else had reserved kayaks for the day we went, we had a private trip with two guides who were very friendly.In the interest of saving money, we did not dine in any of the resort's restaurants. The prices were just outrageous compared to eating outside of the resort or bringing in food from the grocery store/take-out places. We did grab some sushi one night from the Boat Landing Pavilion, which is like a small food court. The sushi was high quality and extremely tasty. We split a combo meal of 3 pieces of Nigiri and 1 large roll (6 pieces) for about $23.00. We also had a few drinks at the bar in the Pavilion, which were about $7.00 for a pint of local beer and $10 for a Lava Flow frozen drink.My one single complaint about the resort comes from our experience with a pushy salesperson at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club desk. When you arrive at the resort, you are informed that you can pick up a free gift at any of their desks. The gift is a \"beach bag,\" basically just an almost disposable bag that we used to take to the beach, etc. When we picked up our bag, the woman at the desk (just across from where you check-in) was very friendly, gave us info on local restaurants and also tried to get us to sign up for their timeshare presentation. You are given $100 in Hilton bucks for attending, which sounded good at first, but we decided that we'd rather spend the 90 minutes doing something fun instead of being pushed to buy vacation property. So we declined. She was very understanding and not pushy at all. The next day we went back down to the desk to ask about a nearby beach and a man (Paul) was working there instead. He did give us the information we asked for about the beach, but then began his hard-sell on the presentation. When I told him that someone else asked us about it and that we weren't interested he just kept pushing and pushing. Finally we just ended up walking away because he wouldn't let it go. There is no way that I would ever agree to anything like that from someone with those kinds of sales tactics! He really put a damper on our impression of the resort.Aside from \"Pushy Paul,\" the resort was very nice and fit our needs. I would recommend it to others and would definitely stay there again myself. ", " My husband, daughter (13mos.), and I stayed a wonderful 3 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. Like most reviews have said, yes it's big and you do walk a lot to get from point A to point B but if you don't mind the walking & have no rush to be anywhere, this place is just fine (there are people who do jog around the property in the morning so running is fine too). We were there for vacation. We had no appointments anywhere. We would just eat, sleep, swim, & sightsee. We didn't mind waiting for the tram or the boat. The tram & boat would depart like every 15min. (sometimes less than that). We stayed in Palace Tower and if we wanted to go to Ocean Tower (which was right next door), we would walk because it only takes 1-2 minutes to get there. Now to go to the main lobby or Lagoon Tower, we would take the tram because it is quite far but some say the tram was useless and I disagree. It worked for us. I guess we were lucky enough that it wasn't a busy week so we could get our own row and bring on the stroller very easily. We booked a 2dbl. bed Lanai/Garden view that turned out to be a golf course view (not complaining) and boy was the room huge. The website said it's about 530sq. ft. It was big & spacious for our 13mos. old to play & run around. My husband would play hide & seek with her by hiding in the big walk-in closet. I like the fact that the hotel is fully cemented so we couldn't hear our neighbors. We would just hear the door shut and people in the hallway but that's about it. No loud t.v. or voices thru that thick cement wall. The stand that the refrigerator is in is a great place to store drinks & food. The snack bars & restaurants in the hotel are pricey so it's good to stock up.Now the pools...ahhh again like I said earlier, it must not have been a busy time because the pool was not crowded. There's 3 pools...Kona pool (Lagoon Tower) w/the biggest slide on the property, Kohala Pool (between Palace & Ocean Tower) w/2 smaller slides, and Ocean Pool (adults only) in the Ocean Tower. And not to forget the huge salt water lagoon w/an array of fishes. We went to the Kona pool and I rode that big slide 5 times while my husband went 3 times. It's a great place for the adults to turn back into a kid (hey we're on vacation!). The self-parking lot is quite some ways from the hotel but the walk didn't seem as bad as it looks. When you check-in, it's good to unload at the lobby and then park the car. Have a bellman take your bags because it's easier! They have an underground tunnel so they will bypass everything. However, depending on how busy they are, it could take anywhere from 30-45 mintues until your bags arrive at your room. We had a great time and will definitely stay there again. Like I said earlier, depending on what your plans are, if you are taking it day by day and have no rush to be anywhere, give this place a try. There's no other resort with so much to do on it's property like the Hilton Waikoloa Village. ", " We used Hilton points to book this resort. The resort was amazing; it was a huge resort and offered a tram and boats to get around. The boats were out of service when we were there; the canal was being repaired. The resort had multiple restaurants and pools. The room was clean, large and the bed was very comfortable. We had an ocean view on the 3rd floor. Being a Hilton member, we received coupons food/beverages. The food was extremely expensive. The best value was the snack bars at the pools. I wasn's impressed with the dinners at the Chinese or Italian restaurants. Breakfast buffet was also very expensive. We picked up some snacks and beverages at a store outside of the resort. Our room had a small refrigerator. We noticed many others taking groceries to their room. The resort charged for self parking and also offered valet. If you have a difficult time walking, this is not the resort for you. There was a lot of walking even when you take the tram. The resort doesn't have the typical beach, but does offer a man-made beach. The pools were very nice and offered a waterslide. ", " We stayed here for our honeymoon and thought it was amazing! The grounds of the hotel are like Disneyland! The animals on sight were so wonderful and the pools where great! We especially loved the lagoon! We could have snorkeled with the turtles all day! Hint: The turtles like to hang out by the waterfall! We only ate at one restaurant at the resort called Donatoni's. The food and ambiance were excellent! We could not afford to eat at the resort any other time but we stocked up at the Walmart in Kona instead of spending $15.00 for a burger at lunch. One of the very best things about this resort it the Dolphin Quest Program! It is pretty pricey but well worth the memories! Make sure to book well in advance. We were there for a week and tried to make a reservation on the first day but they were booked! Luckily they told us that they could fit us in a mini program between the normal scheduled encounters. They called it the VIP and it cost only $150.00 instead of $199.00! They said we would not get into the deep water with the dolphins but we would still get about 20 minutes with them! We went for it and we ended up getting to go in the deep water and everything else! We couldn't stop smiling after our encounter for days! The only down sides to this resort are the self-parking, which is pretty far away and still cost something like $7.00 a day. Also if you don't want to pay a bell man getting all your luggage to your room is quite a trip even with the tram or boats! All in all we couldn't have stayed at a better resort for our honeymoon and we probably won't be able to afford to again! ", " My wife and I visited the Hilton in Waikoloa Village in October 2002 and returned in September 2007 with our Daughter, Son-in-law and Granddaughter. Although I wrote a review about the Hilton Waikoloa about a year ago prior to our visit, I felt compelled to reinterate our love for this resort and the Big Island.This was the first trip to Hawaii for our Daughter's family and we knew we could make it special by visiting this resort which is focussed on family and entertainment. Many have expressed a dislike for the vast number of acres the resort covers and the inconvenience of having to walk or wait in line for one of the two modes of transportation (boat or monorail) to get from one point to another. If you are on a stop watch vacation and/or eschew the idea of walking for exercise; better look elsewhere. However, if you don't mind strolling through the art, gardens, and along the ocean coast; you will find this place beautiful. The resort sits on 50+ acres, but with that much room we never felt crowded or that the pools and restaurants were overrun with visitors.The Big Island is facinating and just as beaudtiful as Maui; which itself isn't bad. The kids enjoyed the Dolphin Encounter, watching the sea turtles sun, the Blue Hawaii helicopter flight over the volcanoes, and the magnificent sunset at the KPC. Although there was construction in the Lagoon Towers area and the monorail was not running; it did not disrupt a wonderful family vacation.We recommend Hapuna Beach and \"A\" Beach, both very close to the resort. The King's Shopping area has plenty of selection and Roy's is worth making reservations for dinner. Both of the resort courses, The Beach Course and the Kings Course, are challenging and provide some fantastic vistas. There is also a package price for the both that is worth the investment.If you want beauty and room to \"spread out\", this is the place for you. ", " We had a great time! Like everywhere else, there will be things that are not perfect, but that is life. Everyone was very friendly. the size of the resort is impressive and it does make you wait a little bit for the boat or tram but it helps you to adjust to the pace of life on the island. If you are so incredibly picky that you can't enjoy the surroundings, then stay home. More than likely, your mind is already made up as to whether you are going to enjoy your trip or not before you leave your home.Lopaca, the manager at the valet desk was probably one of the nicest people we have met. He knew our names every time we needed our car. When we asked for a late checkout because our flight was at midnight, we were able to stay until 9:00 pm! I'll take kind of customer service any day over a few items that might not be up to the Queen of England's expectations. It's Hawaii... Relax and enjoy it... ", " I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in January of 2007 with my daughter. We went there as a celebration for her getting her masters. This was the best experience ever. The service was incredible; the staff could not have been nicer. The room was impeccable, it was like heaven, and on top of it all, it was a complimentary room, I used my American Express points. We hated to leave. I have traveled to many places and this ranks up there as one of the best. The food was fabulous too, as I work in NYC; I am use to fine dining. Stay there if you have the chance, you won\u2019t be disappointed. ", " Me and my boyfriend stayed here 10/23-26. We had landed on the Big Island with no hotel reservations so we found a restaurant with free wifi and was able to get a room at the Hilton through Priceline. This was our second trip to the Big Island and I wanted to stay in the Waikoloa area during the first half of our trip because we hadn't the previous time. The Hilton Waikoloa Palace Tower room was large, very nice, and had a lanai facing the lagoon. The beds (especially the pillows) were soooo comfy. We weren't able to hear any noise from the hallways or from the adjacent rooms. The bathroom was a regular bathroom but the shower did have plenty of water pressure and hot water. There was a coffee pot and fridge in the room.The housekeeping folks were very nice and efficient. All of the public/common areas are beautifully decorated and maintained. Internet is available but not free. There was also a daily parking fee. Because the property is rather large, you can take a train or river boat between the various buildings. They come often enough so we never waited more than 10 minutes or so. Just walking between the Palace Tower to the registration lobby took about 5 minutes. If you're the type to go to a resort and spend most of your vacation at the resort, you'll enjoy this place - dolphins, lagoons, waterslide, restaurants, dancing, and spa. (I even saw a turtle swimming in the lagoon/pool next to the Lagoon Towers). Otherwise it's a distance to travel to the various other island locations.The main restaurants are nice restaurants - not flip-flop/tshirt type restaurants. I did get some chinese food to go from Kirin. Food was pretty good but expensive - about twice as much as normal local restaurants. If you're interested in expensive eating and shopping, the Waikoloa area has plenty of resort shops.The cheap eats we found were in the King's Shopping Center's food court. There was one little place in the food court that had spam, egg & rice - quinessential Hawaii which I seem to crave whenever I'm in Hawaii. If you want something more reasonable with more variety, you'll want to be in Kona.If you want to pick up some stuff to stock the fridge, Costco isn't far from the Kona airport. We picked up soda and snacks so we could have them while we roamed the island. They also have probably the cheapest gas on the island. If you happen to be in Waimea, you can stop by the supermarket there. It had a very nice deli counter that also had soups and fresh sushi.Most of the golf courses are in the Waikoloa area. My boyfriend was able to golf at the Kings course. What they don't tell you is that quite often the trade winds blow bad enough that you can't play in the afternoons. The Kona Country Club says that KCC is in the shadow of a mountain that shields it from the wind so it was nice when we golfed there.We did do the Manta dive/snorkel. It was well worth it. The mantas are so big and graceful. The mantas can swim within inches of you. Just be aware that you and a hundred other tourists will be in the water at the same time. The snorkelers were running into each other because of the wave action of the ocean. ", " I reserved a room at this hotel with some trepidation based on prior reviews regarding size, cost, etc. My wife and I were celebrating 10 years of wedding bliss and wanted a relaxing hotel on the Big Island after roughing it a bit on Kauai (i.e., lots of hiking, kayaking, etc.). Here is the deal with this hotel as I see it. Yes, it is large. However, if you generally walk five minutes at home without considering it your daily exercise, then this walk from the lobby to the furthest parts of the resort is easy. It takes longer to wait for the boat or the tram than it does to just walk the distance to your room in the hotel. Lots of interesting things to look at while you walk anyway and another chance to burn off the big lunch or dinner. If you have younger kids, they may find the repeated walk a bit long. Still, it gives the kids some time to burn off some energy as well.The hotel was very clean and well maintained. Everyone was friendly from the bellhops to the housekeeping to the concierge. Our room was spacious and clean, with all the amenities you expect from a resort hotel. Again, as expected, a bit pricey for food in the area. Do yourself a favor and when you exit the Kona airport, instead of turning left towards the hotel (about 20 miles), turn right and head to Kona (about 4 miles) first to stock up on water, snacks, wine, etc. at the local food store. This will help minimize some costs when you get to the resort. We spent one full day at the resort (at the pool, golfing, etc.) and another two days exploring the island (i.e., Hilo, Volcano Park, Kona). Hence, we did not spend every waking moment at the hotel, but when we did, it was an extremely enjoyable experience.Final notes: Visit the Kona Brewery in Kona and try their Castaway IPA, Black Sand Porter, or Pipeline Porter. All good beer choices. They also have good food at reasonable prices. Also, at the hotel, we ate at the Kamuela Provision company. Splurge a little and try the 8 bites sampler menu. Fantastic small tastes of very good appetizers. Our main courses were delicious as well. Have fun on the Big Island! ", " Congratulations to Dieter Seeger for running an outstanding resort. My husband and I stayed 5 nights from Oct. 6 - Oct. 11, 2007. Our room was in the Ocean Tower with a great ocean view. The room was large and clean. I loved the large open closet. The bathroom was also very clean and well laid out. The maid and turn down service were excellent every day, including plenty of fresh towels. Upon arrival, the valet ensured the bellman got our bags to the room quickly and upon checkout the bags were delivered to the car with equal efficiency (much more quickly than we were told on the phone). We had no issues with baggage handling and were unimpressed with people carting their own bags onto the boat. We could only guess they were unwilling to provide a tip for the bellman service. Getting around the property was easy. We found the boat service very reliable but slow for our taste so we chose to walk for the most part. The tram ran to the Palace Tower and was then under construction for the duration of the way to the Ocean Tower. However, the walk from the Palace Tower to the Ocean Tower is short. We enjoyed walking the grounds as there is something to see along every part. We discovered wild life, great landscaping, and beautiful pieces of art at every turn. We enjoyed a good meal outside by the water at Donatoni's, the Italian restaurant. We arrived just in time for a specatular sunset. For folks concerned about cost, the nearby offiste (in the King's shops) restaurant, Roy's has an excellent fixed price menu. We didn't use them but the laundry facilities in the ground floor of the Ocean Tower seemed very convenient. We also felt there were a good number of lounges located near several pools. We spent our days at the adult pool. We enjoyed our stay and found the room rates reasonable. ", " We have a time share with Hilton Grand...we stayed in the Bay Club Resort area which is located on this property also...it was wonderful,....the time share was great...my experience was so great that I would go back any time...the location of the resort to the airport or into the city is 45 minute drive you must have a car, because the taxi fare was 60.00 one way to get out to the grocery store and other shopping....there is the store on the resort property that is a little expensive but if you have a rental car you will be in good shape. I rate the resort AAA+ There are no buses that go to this location.....and the tours are great...long but great! ", " We used our Hilton points staying here and we've used them all over the world.(diamond level) We were apprehensive since large hotels tend to get run down. Not here! everything was clean, and people friendly and helpful. they have a tram (or a boat!) to take you to your wing. The longest we waited was 6 mins for the tram. Our room was great, part ocean view and overlooking one of the many pools. I can see why it would be a great place for kids. so many activities and swimming options to choose from. we were never asked about sitting in on \"grand vacation time share\" anything. We weren't nickel and dimed at all. Didn't even pay for parking. we asked at the concierge about a late check out and were given till 1 pm. and we were told we could use the spa facilities at the end of the day to shower, and refresh! nice touch! If you don't have diamond level, they still let you use a room for about an hour to shower, etc.since most flights leave at midnight from Kona. people complain about the birds being loud, we loved it! we left the lanai screen door open (room Ocean 4088) all night and listened to the ocean. slept great. would we stay here without using points? Probably not, since we usually rent a condo on the islands. We had a great experience here and would use our points again. ", " We just got back from The Hilton Waikoloa Village and it was an absolutely beautiful resort! The grounds and pool are immaculate, and the lagoon is the coolest. My children loved the lagoon. We saw about 5 to 6 turtles everytime we snorkeled in it. We stayed in the ocean towers, which the view was gorgeous, but it was far away from everything. There are a few smaller pools close to the ocean tower, but we preferred the lagoon, so it was quite far. If I go back I will stay in the lagoon towers as it is close to the pools. That is the only \"complaint\" I have about the resort, and I don't even know if I would call it a complaint. Also, be prepared as the food at the hotel is extrememly expensive. I went knowing that, but I was shocked at just how expensive it really is. The only other thing I can think of to let people know is that the resort is pretty secluded. The town of Kona is a good 45 minutes, and if there is any traffic, it can be more. That being said, I would very highly recommend the resort for families, couples, friends, everyone. It is and experience you will thoroughly enjoy. ", " We really enjoyed our six nights at the Hilton Waikoloa. The hotel is split up into 3 hotel buildings, the Lagoon tower(closest to the Largest pool and the lagoon and dolphin pond), the Palace tower(located near the japanese, and italian restaurants) and the Ocean tower closest to the buffet breakfast,dinner and the river pools and mini golf) I personnel like the Lagoon tower. The pools and slides are fantastic, the lagoon is great with turtles and fish but try to get there early to reserve a nice spot, and get into the lagoon while it is low tide when the water is clearer. As for the specifics: the self parking is $9 daily, valet is $16.50 daily. When you rent the water toys for the lagoon..., water bikes, 1,2,3 man kayaks, 1 or 4 person paddle boats you pay per half or full hour the rates range from $25 to $35 and hour. Mini golf is $16 a round for adults lower for kids, buffet breakfast is $30 and dinner buffet is $40 per adult.. if you'd like to save a little money there is a package called the \"Aloha Fun Package\" for $25/day, you have to ask for it when you check in, you can get it from the first day or only for part of your stay they are very flexible at the hotel, it will include a lower rate to park, free for self park or $7.50 valet daily, it includes a daily $25 credit to rent the water toys at the lagoon, 1 hour of free tennis i believe thats also daily, 2 free mini golfs during your stay not daily, and a few other perks its well worth it to check it out. There is also a Costco for the cheapest gas and snacks 2 miles from the airport...exit airport and drive south(right turn from airport exit). Hilton waikoloa is left turn exiting airport about 18 miles...drive carefully and have a nice stay...aloha ", " We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and loved it!The hotel lobby is huge and looks pretty amazing too. The staff on the front desk were very helpful. I would advise you to get your luggage delivered to your room though as it is a long way to drag suitcases etc.Once we had checked in you have the choice of walking, taking a boat or using the monorail to get to your room. Our room was in the Ocean Tower which was quite a distance from the lobby. We hired a car and self parked ($9 a day, $16 for valet). The car park was busy but we never had a problem finding a space. From the car park to the Ocean Tower was a 20min walk. It is quite a way but it really didn't spoil our trip. The monorail is slow and we didn't use it much, the boats are more regular.Our room was fantastic. It was large and modern and had everything we needed. We had a garden view room which looked over the golf course. The room had a safe and a fridge. The bathroom was nice with a good selection of spa toiletries.The pools in the resort are amazing, waterslides, waterfalls etc. If you want a bit of piece and quiet though there is an adults only pool.There are many restaurants/snack bars in the beautiful grounds. They are a little expensive though. We ate at the chinese restaurant one night and the food was very good. The other nights we ate out at the Kings shops, just down the road (will need to drive). There is a good steakhouse, a Roys and a few others. If you want cheaper food you will need to drive 20/25 mins to Kona. Buy drinks, snacks etc form the Walmart in Kona and keep them in your room fridge as things like a small bottle of water was $2. Our room price included the breakfast buffet from the palm terrace restaurant which was fantastic. We chose to take ours up to our room but most people ate in the open air restaurant. The only annoying aspect about many of the eating places is the number of birds surrounding the tables and swooping accross them when you are trying to eat.We also went to the Luau one night. I think it was about $80 per person. This included a glass of fruit punch, a shell lei, a alcoholic/soft drink of your choice (including cocktails), traditional buffet and entertainment. We really enjoyed the luau, yes it is touristy but it was a good laugh and the food was pretty good too.During your stay make sure you try out all the pools and wander around the grounds. Sunset at Budda point is beautiful.We used the hotel as a base so we could see the Big Island (which is amazing by the way!) and we still got to explore all the facilities. Overall: We loved it!! ", " This place is absolutely gorgeous. I must admit the food and drinks are pricey, and Waikoloa is rather isolated so other options are hard to come by without a car. However, the hotel, rooms and grounds are beautiful. Pure paradise! ", " We stayed at the new timeshare units which just opened recently. The rooms are BREATHTAKING! The decor is so elegant and high class. The service, however, was a little lacking. They only clean once a week, which we knew about, but they didn't replenish our toiletries, etc. and were told we needed to buy our own extra laundry detergent. However, this did not detract from our pleasure of the room. It is spacious. The master bedroom had a whole wing of clear glass shower, a large jacuzzi, walk in closet, double sink and a HUGE wall mirror. I can't even describe it, it was so nice. The kitchen was also very nice. The shuttle takes us over to the hotel part where we can use the pools - they have fabulous pools with slides, waterfalls, and a lagoon for snorkeling, kayaking, paddle boats, etc. On our property were grill stations, where we can grill steaks, etc. (We bought juicy steaks, shrimps, pork chops from Costco) - not only was this cost saving, but it was hot off the grill dinner for all of us! ", " I loved this hotel. From the minute you walk in the door everyone is so friendly and nice. And the ground with the lagoon and pools and trees and flowers are goreous. In fact, I got married there!!! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Villages was a real treat. There are a number of pools, plus a lagoon that you can snorkel or paddle in. ", " This hotel was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Ever. The facility is absolutely beautiful-immaculately kept with reproduction art everywhere on display on the grounds. It is an oasis in the middle of burnt black volcanic rock. Mention that you are on your honeymoon and the hotel will give you free champagne in your room. There are plenty of restaurants on site and you can rent water bicycles and other water equipment on the premises. The grounds are massive and although you can either take a tram or a boat to get to your room we mostly ended up walking because it was faster than waiting. For a perfect honeymoon, you can do no better than the Hilton Waikoloa Village. ", " We stayed in the ocean tower with an incredible view of the ocean. Sipping Champagne and watching the sunset was a perfect moment on our honeymoon. The food was pricey but always excellent. Walking across the resort was a long trip but worth it simply for the sights. I would very much recommend doing the sea quest with the dolphins, try and book earlier in the morning to insure that the snorkeling in the lagoon has more sights to see, the later in the day it is the less fish and turtles you'll see. ", " This hotel is gorgeous! The 60 some acres are filled with green tropical gardens, hammocks, and a walking path along the water's edge. The walking path is lit with tiki torches at sunset every night. Because the size of the property, there is also a little boat ride or tram available to take you to different spots. Our hotel room was an ocean view room, which was really nice. We enjoyed the little chocolates and fresh flowers placed on our bed each day after the rooms were cleaned. If you have Diamond status, you'll enjoy a very nice breakfast every morning with delicious fresh fruit, coffee and pastries. They ended up running out of pineapple by the end of our stay, because it was so good and the first thing to go.We were on the island for 9 days and spent every other day just relaxing by the pool. The pool is very big and has a waterfall at one end. The hotel also offers an opportunity to swim with dolphins on location. We didn't participate in the program, but spent a lot of time watching the dolphins swim around . There's also a lagoon area where you can snorkel, paddle boat, or kayak.We used the spa a couple of times to work out. The facility offered several cardio machines and plenty of free weights. We booked all of our activities at their tour and activities desk. The hotel is also conveniently located next to a shopping center (walking distance) where you can find a little general store and restaurants.We enjoyed the Malolo Lounge where you can listen to live jazz music nightly and have a few cocktails. ", " This was my third visit to this hotel in 3 years. I have been to all the islands and stayed at several nice resorts but this by far is my favorite. The rooms are spacious and clean. The water amenities are fantastic. We love the ocean fed lagoon for snorkling and kayaking. There are several pools to suit your desires from a lazy river, water slides, waterfall, adult pool and sand pool. The hotel grounds are so beautiful. The restaurants in particular for dinner are way overpriced. We ate at the Chinese restaurant and it was very good but it was about $120 for two entree's and 2 drinks. Cocktails at the bar or poolside are over $10 per drink so be prepared. We had a room bar charge that was erroneous and it was an easy fix to have the charge removed by the front desk person. They don't give free room upgrades to Hilton Honors GOLD members despite what the hilton website states. Roys restaurant which is always tasty with great service at the nearby shopping center is worth the money. There is a steak restaurant (can't remember the name) in that shopping center thats not too great.If you are looking for a small quant resort this is not the resort for you. But if you want a place that offers a variety to options this place is great. If you can go off season the place feels almost empty. ", " Our family of 4 enjoyed our stay so much last year that we booked another 7 nights the end of July! I can not believe some of the reviews I've read on this site. Our vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa last year was paradise and far surpassed our expectations. I don't understand the complaints about the staff. They were very polite and always helpful. We did our homework and had an itinerary that worked beatifully for us. We ate a few meals on site and knew just what to expect...there were no surprises when the bill came at the end of our stay (Check out the menus and exact costs on their website). The premises are beautiful and we never waited longer than 3 minutes for a ride on the tram....but honestly, we walked most of the time. I'm not the most fit 47 year old but aside from having a segway I could not have had an easier time getting around. The island has so much to offer that you will do yourself a disservice if you do not rent a car. Fairwinds morning snorkel was a once in a lifetime experience and horseback riding in Waipao Valley was the best part of our trip. Hapuna beach was spectacular, but remember that on the weekends the little food shack and beach rentals are closed....save Hapuna for the middle of the week. Roy's at the Kings Shops (take the shuttle) was our favorite meal...Merriman's was OK. Oh, and if you are a costco member a quick stop early on can save you plenty. Only other suggestion when traveling to the Big Island would be to buy the book The Big Island Revealed. It really is a wonderful guide. ", " My Husband and I stayed at the Waikoloa Hilton to celebrate our 25th Anniversary from October 14-22, 2006. This was our second time here. The first time was in Dec of 2004 for a Conference. There is no other place we would rather stay. The grounds are very lovely. The Tram and boats that get you from one place to another are a wonderful surprise and add to the ambience of the resort. You are carried slowly across beautiful groves of trees, flowers and are met with wonderful views. No rush here, take your time and enjoy !! Many people write that there is an offensive odor from the canal, we DID NOT experience that either time we were there. We especially loved to walk the property at night after dinner when all the torches are lit. We stayed both times in the Ocean Tower with a mountain and lagoon view. The rooms are wonderful, very comfortable beds. Staff was very concerned with our comfort and absolutely answered to any need we had. There are many restaraunts to choose from, lots of variey in the food. Prices are not that different from here in the New York Area and we travel enough to know NOT to have the breakfast buffet unless it is included in our room package as all resorts are way over priced in this area. That said, we had the \"wonderful\" priviledge?? to wake up on our first full day there (October 15) to the first earthquake they have had in over 25 years. 6.7 on the richter scale!!! Followed by a 5.6 quake 15 minutes later. Being from the East Coast and never experiencing that before, we were scared out of our minds. We were on the 5th floor, dressers moved across the room, all the water sloshed out of the toilet, the buiding swayed. I have never experienced anything like that in my life and hope I never do again. They were very quick in getting us all out to the golf course away from the hotel and the water. We were held there about 90 minutes. There was minor damage to the Hotel, nothing structural. They were worried about the gas lines, so until they were checked out, none of the restaraunts were open. We were allowed back to our rooms . They did a great job keeping us all calm, fed and boozed. Free food at breafast, lunch and dinner that day. They kept us updated with memos placed under our doors and the staff was knowledgable when we questioned them. We spent the rest of the day at the pool just trying to relax. We were able to get to the Kings Shops at the Island Steakhouse (another of our favorite places to eat) for dinner. Everything was back to normal on Oct 16th, but we were still looking over our shoulders for the next one to come as we were having many aftershocks for the next 2 days. If they can deal with that kind of disaster, there isn't anything they can't do.We recommend this resort to anyone who tells us they are going to Hawaii.ENJOY !!! ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for one week in August 2005.I would recommend renting a car to get from the airport to the hotel,it is a long but beautiful drive! Also, if you're a Costco member, there is a Costco in Kona on the way to the hotel...great place to get snacks/drinks and also cheap souvenirs as well! The hotel lobby is open and beautiful! It is pretty much in the center of the hotel grounds. From there, you have three choices of getting to your room...walking, taking the Disney-like monorail, or a Disney-like boat (reminded me of the Jungle Cruise!). I liked trying each to get a different experience. The rooms were adequate, we got one with a king bed and couch pull-out...nothing special, but then again we didn't spend much time in the room! There are a few pool choices, they are all beautifully landscaped andinclude hot tubs hidden in caves and other neat features! Another aquatic must-do is the Dolphin Quest, if you have the $$! It was the experience of a lifetime to swim with the dolphins. Our adventure also included snorkeling in the hotel's lagoon on a motorized undersea hover-scooter (hard to describe)...it was cool! We saw tons of fish, sea turtles, etc....even if you don't do Dolphin Quest, definitely go to the lagoon area!Dining choices were plentiful at the Hilton Waikoloa Village..they had Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Hawaiian, and more! My favorite was Imari, the Japanese restaurant. It was like Benihana, but better! The service was great as well as the atmosphere, I felt like I was in a Japanese home. Another great restaurant was Kamuela Provisions Company...it was seafood and steaks with a wonderful view. Get the S'mores for dessert, you make them yourself!Another place that is a short walk/drive away that is worth visiting is the Kings' Shops. There are good dining and shopping choices there! They have a great duty-free shop, Louis Vuitton, art galleries, touristy shops, surf shops, etc. For dining, definitely check out Roy's. I would recommend making reservations. It is the ultimate in Hawaiian fusion cuisine...fresh seafood, Asian influences, altogether fine dining. For a more reasonable alternative, try the Big Island Steak House. They have seafood and steaks with a view over the lagoon area. The Kings' Shops also have a food court with a Subway, Starbucks, and other choices. Check out [-----] for a full listing of shops and an overview of the Waikoloa resort in general.I ", " My wife and I stayed six nights at the Hilton after a week on Kauai for our honeymoon. Based on the hotel's website and the TripAdvisor reviews, we expected a HUGE resort with a lot of fun activities and great food. That's what we got! We had a top-floor partial-oceanview room in the Lagoon Tower. It faced away from the resort but had a nice view of the tennis courts, the mountains, and the ocean in the distance. Everything in the room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. The tower was in an ideal location - closest to the lobby, the Kona pool, and the shops within the resort.Donatoni's and the Kamuela Provision Co. were both excellent - great service, excellent food, and beautiful settings. Both meals were expensive, but we expected that (and it was worth it). In addition to those restaurants, we also ate at the Lagoon Grill, the Orchid Cafe, the Palm Terrace (for breakfast every morning, which was included in our package), the Boat Landing Pavillion, and the Malolo Lounge. Each was better than what we expected, but at resort prices.The pool was great! We used the Kona pool (near the Lagoon Tower), and the waterslide and the waterfalls were tons of fun! We found the pool temperature to be perfect on a sunny day and cool (but very swimmable) on a cloudy day. There are three whirlpools nearby (with a lot of unsupervised children playing in them), but the best one (the only one with jets) is only accessible by wading in the pool.Despite its size, the resort is easy to get around, at least to those that are able-bodied. The boat is very slow and meanders a bit, so we used it as a fun ride. The tram service was operating only from the lobby to the Ocean Tower when we arrived, but resumed service to and from the Lagoon Tower halfway through our stay. If you don't have to wait for it to come, taking the tram is faster than walking. Otherwise, it'll take longer than walking. They could add more directional signage to help guide guests throughout the resort.People on and off the resort referred to the Hilton as \"Disneyland.\" They're right - it's not \"Old Hawaii,\", but really, what is? We made time for doing several activities on the island and were happy to come back to the resort afterwards. Overall, we had a fantastic time. We're already talking about coming back someday! ", " Stayed here for 7 nights for our honeymoon. After vegas this was just what was needed. At check in we got upgraded to a suite as hotel pretty full. Room in ocean tower was fantastic, staff really friendly and couldn't do enough to help, room always very clean. Plenty of places to eat within the complex giving a wide variety of foods and cost. Plenty of choices for a pool including adult only within ocean tower. Sunsets to die or and a great place to stay. ", " Ahola! I just today returned from a 9 day stay (June 21-June 30) at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. After the 12 hours of flying, I was definately tired and wanted to get to my room. I stayed in room 2092 in the Ocean Tower. In spite of the many negative reviews about the large resort (and it is HUGE), the trip from the lobby to my room was not bad at all. The boat comes frequently, and it is a leisurely ride. The tram comes less often and actually is slower because of the longer stops. BTW, it is 10 minute walk from the lobby to the Ocean Tower. That's nothing. Enjoy the walk along the Museum Walkway. Lots of unique and interesting pieces of Pacific Islander/Asian art. Even though the Ocean Tower is the farthest building, I felt it was perfect. Quieter. The coffee kiosk is right there. Palm Terrace restaurant is also downstairs, and it is casual attire. And the adult pool is also here. The hotel grounds are amazing. Beautiful views. Lush and green (fyi, the landscape from Kona airport to the hotel looks a lot the moon due to the 1801 Lava flows.) I rented a car from Dollar. It came to $300 for 9 days. Great deal. Suggestion--rent a car!!! The hotel is just that a hotel. Getting away from the hotel is the best way to experience the Big Island. Another suggestion--valet park!! Yes it is $16.50/day but well worth. Self parking is a hassle. Trust me. Here are some random thoughts and other suggestions-->The food at the hotel is expensive. Go to the Kings' Shops just up the street for cheaper and better food. Subway, DQ. General store for basic needs. Ali'i Drive in Kona also has a lot of restaurants and shops.>Hapuna Beach has an awesome beach and great snorkeling!! The beach @ Mauna Loa Resort has even better snorkeling from shore. Both are 15 minutes north of hotel. Don't skip these!!>Drive to Poluu Valley at the tip of island on Rt 270 in North Kohala. Hike down a hill to a black sand beach. Not an easy hike but well worth it. AWESOME! This is the real Big Island. Highlight of my trip.>For aloha shirts and souvenirs, go to Kona. Hilo Hatties has a large selection and they do offer a shuttle from hotel. Also Int'l Kona Market has great shirts, trinkets, and souvenirs. Also Walmart for food, water and extras.>Blue Hawaiian Helicopters provide a fantastic tour of island. 2 hour tour on Eco star is $400 (a lot i know but worth it.) Helicopter is the easist way to see volcanoes and the valleys on the Hilo side. BTW, Crater Road is CLOSED!! And no lava flowing currently but that could change in a second.>Kona Joe Coffee farm was a neat experience. Very serene and quiet. Fun side trip.>Lastly, Red Sail Sport offers a great Snorkel & Sail trip on a catamaran. Fun and great coral reef for snorkeling.Enjoy the Big Island.Aloha and mahalo!! ", " Amazing facilities - especially pools, dolphin habitat, manicured grounds. Friendly staff. Nice rooms. Only complaint was the outrageous price of even simple things like breakfast - $10 for a coffee and bagel. Though we aren't resort lovers, we really enjoyed a one night stay here at the end of a week on the Big Island. The \"lagoon\" is good for small children to try out snorkeling for the first time, but if you're in Hawaii and only snorkel here, you're really missing out. There is amazing snorkeling all over the island - get out and see it! ", " Wonderful property; stayed for business conference. It is very spread out - bring your walking shoes. It is a good long walk to get to anything. Multiple pools but access to ocean is difficult and a little bit away at A Bay. The shores are pretty rocky. The rooms were very good (stayed in Ocean Tower) - excellent bed and good sized room. Other reviewers have mentioned the birds - they are loud at night but I had no trouble sleeping through them. Drinks were expensive, did not buy any food.I would come back with my family but would stay in one of the condos in Waikoloa. ", " We had a wonderful time as did other reviewers so I won't waste your time with repeat raves. Just wanted to offer some tips as we just returned. The restaurants were gorgeous but because we did not pack any \"nice\" clothes, we did not feel comfortable eating there. My husband hates dressing up on vacation but even he expressed some slight regret at not having packed a nice pair of pants so that we could enjoy the restaurants at the hotel. But we did enjoy the restaurants at the Kings Court, down the street, which were definitely a lot more casual. The food was great and the prices were slightly less than that of the hotel restaurants. We also drove down to the main town where there are many nice restaurants with gorgeous views of the ocean.We had a gorgeous ocean and bay view room in the Ocean tower and enjoyed the Executive floor continental breakfasts and snacks/appetizers. I loved our room and have no complaints but if you want to overlook the dolphins and the larger pool, plus the ocean, you might want to ask specifically for the Lagoon tower. The first day, however, we could hear a loudspeaker blaring from the lagoon pool area to our room across the grounds, which made me glad we were in the Ocean Tower.We enjoyed the lagoon for snorkeling and found it similar to the beach areas we tried but I would recommend only snorkeling in the morning, especially if the tide is low. The water is clearer and you can really get up close and personal with the fish and the turtles. I swam alongside a turtle for the whole length of the lagoon. I watched a large school of fish giving another turtle a bath! I was angry, however, when I saw another snorkeler kick out and shove a turtle away but I think she was more startled than anything and panicked because the turtles have no fear and would even swim close to shore. You can also snorkel under the bridge out into the bay area of the hotel if you want.The hotel is 17 miles from the main town of Kaiula-Kona and about 2-3 hours from Hilo and Volcano National Park. I would strongly recommend you stay overnight at one of the many bed and breakfast inns in the area, especially if you plan on taking the volcano hike at night. On our first visit, we drove back to Kailua-Kona after our hike and my poor husband was exhausted. It was also very scary driving in the dark with the rain and unknown highway. On this visit we stayed at the Country Goose overnight and this gave us more time to explore the area.Speaking of the lava flow....on our first trip here about two years ago, we were able to hike right up to small pockets of lava oozing out of the ground and watch its slow but hot and fiery progress way before the actual lava flow that ended up in the ocean. That hike was like a mile or so from the ranger station at the end of the road.This trip, however, we gave up after hiking a mile and then finding out you had to hike another 5 miles or more to MAYBE see anything. The next morning we approached the lava plume from the other side (Hilo side) where the locals go but again gave up because of the heat rising up from the ground. We still could not see the point where the lava actually entered the water. But on this side of the volcano, you could really see the lava plume of smoke rising from thearea where it was going into the ocean. I think the best way after two unsuccessful tries is to see it up close by boat or in the air via helicopter.I hope this helps you if you are travelling to this Paradise this summer. We had a great time and are already planning our next trip. ", " What can I say... WOW! My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for a week for our wedding aniversary in April and we could not fault the resort.We were taken back by the size and grandness of the entire place. The accomodation was great, fantastic pools and the lagoon was great fun to snorkle in.We found all the staff to be fantastic and very friendly, a few even remembered our name day to day... a big achievement considering the number of people they must see in a day.All in all, if we were in Hawaii again I would stay at the Hilton. ", " June 17, 2007 report. I just got back from the Hilton Waikoloa and loved it! !!!! We stayed at the Ocean Tower which was situated very close to the band which played music during Dolphin Days Fundraiser. (fundraiser for Shriner's Hospital). We attended the Wine and Food Festival where I met two Top Chefs Marcel and Elia there in person. The food was fabulous and I was stuffed. I enjoyed the food from Lualalai and 3660 on the Rise the most. There were fireworks too! The Waikoloa will be undergoing changes in 3 months. They are going to replace the tram with a new one. The current tram is from 1988 so it's getting old. Parts are hard to get. We drove all the way to the \"City of Refuge\" for snorkeling but I saw more sea creatures in the Waikoloa Lagoon. I saw eels, turtles and fish. You have to go early in the morning around 7 am to see the sea life feed. Talking to the workers there helps because they give you tips. The birds at Waikoloa are so LOUD that at 5:30 am we woke up from their noise. No alarm clock needed. LOL! In Hilo you have the Coqui frogs which get loud at night. Walmart brought them over from Puerto Rico and they are now a big problem in Hilo. They sound like birds. Getting back to the Waikoloa...the boat does take a long time. The tram takes about 10 minutes. It can get old to wait for the tram and the walk to your car because its so far but I have to say that I really enjoyed my stay there. The bed was so comfortable you could melt into it. I also enjoyed the lush beauty and the art sculptures. What I didn't like is that it's pretty much a contained community and about 30 minutes from the airport. If you want to visit Kailua-Kona to shop, it's a long drive, around 45 minutes. We went to a small flea market on Alii Drive. Kailua Kona has a Walmart, KMart and Costco. There is a King Shoppe area outside the Waikoloa but it's very touristy there and I didn't care for the shops but they are building a new shopping mall across the street. We went on the Mauna Kea tour where you vist the summit and see the world class Observatories including the Onizuka museum and the Keck Observatories. My God!!! Saddle Road is so long, winding and bumpy. It took around 2 hours to get to the summit and it got really really cold. It's around 40 degrees at the top and there are no plants growing up there. The tour says that your oxygen level will lower by 40% but it's not the oxygen that bothered me but the winding road. I threw up from car sickness after adjusting to 13, 000 ft to sea level. A lot of people felt a little dizzy up there too. You have to move slowwwwww. Anyway it was a fun vacation overall and Waikoloa is a beautiful hotel!!!!!!!I liked the pasteries at the KimoBean store. The chocolate crossants are the bomb! ", " My husband, 12 year old son, and I visited the big island of Hawaii for spring break this year. We stayed five nights in a first floor room which opened out directly to our own little lanai, and then it was just a few steps down the beautiful grassy knoll to reach the lagoon, dolphin area, and incredible swimming pools. The ocean could be seen just beyond that. Beautiful!!! One of our guides referred to Waikoloa Village as Walk-a-lot-a Village, and everyone laughed, knowingly. It's true that there's a lot of territory to cover in the resort, so plan accordingly and try to book your room in the section of the resort where you plan to spend most of your time. If you are traveling with children who will want to splash at the pool a lot, try for the Lagoon Tower, first floor if possible. I think a lot of the reveiwer's frustrations with various aspects of Waikoloa - be it surly staff, humidity, or long waits for transportation or food - would not be all that different no matter where they vacationed. Some people are just determined to look at the down side of things. Get over yourselves, puh-leeze. This is a lovely resort in a beautiful tropical paradise, and if you put your happy face on going into it, I'm pretty sure you'd have a wonderful time, like so many of us seemed to have had at Waikoloa. The staff could not have been friendlier, and are a chief reason to return. Our room maid was extremely accomodating, moving around with the pull-out bed the first day, and then the fold-out cot we had brought in (our son was a smidge uncomfortable on the sofa pull-out). She tidied up after us and refilled the lovely Kohala Spa products each day, and she was super friendly, visiting with us when we were crossing paths. Likewise, I thought everyone we met there was very friendly to us. The grounds are immaculate, and the pool is so much fun to enjoy with your child. I recommend a rousing game of full-scale pool tag, from one end to the other, daily. We're returning next spring break, even going to do the time-share presentation, me with my fingers crossed that we might be lucky enough to call Hawaii home one week a year for the rest of our lives. ", " I have had the pleasure of staying in this hotel twice in the last 3 years, the last time being Aug. 2006, I'm a little late on a review, but was shocked when I came on trip advisor to see the rating for this hotel.I love this place, I can't say it enough! The hotel is a resort that you never have to leave. The hotel/grounds are huge and beautiful. I just don't get the past posters either they are just two lazy to walk for more than 5 minutes, or too impatient to wait for the tram. Do people forget they are on vacation?Staying at the hotel with my parents, who are hilton honors so had the pleasure of using the lounge, located in the ocean tower. It's very nice and comfy with lots of seating both in a large room and on a patio. Not much in the way of snacks during the day just cookies, but had an amazing breakfast with all kinds of fruit, and paistries.Yes I will admit the food is extremly expensive, but quality is outstanding. My favorite has to be Donatoins, the italian resturant, I have eaten at many great places but nothing beats the meal, service, or view I had - go early or reserve a table on the patio to watch the sunset. A cheaper option at the resort is the Palm Terrace resturant, had everything from burgers to pizza big enough to split. If you can't afford to eat in the resturants everyday, Kona is only a half hour drive away and has some great priced places, including a very good hard rock cafe. Kona also has some great shopping don't miss the abc store. Just a couple miles past kona are some wonderful beaches for swiming and snorkaling, with snorkal rentals right on the beach.Also between the hilton and the airport (20 min drive) there is a small shopping area with some great stores like target, macy's not far from there is a costco, they are kinda hidden from the street so just look for the signs.Overall the hilton is one of my fav hotels, i never experienced anything but great service, and after reading the complaints find most of them to me petty, don't forget your on vacation, so just relax.Tip: Try to book in the Lagoon tower, it's close to the lobby and the biggest pool, also rooms have amazing views of the lagoon and dolphin pool, I mean who doesn't like getting up at sunrise and watching the dolphins jump.I highly recommend this hotel, it is not a hotel for those with strollers or wheelchairs as mentioned. But for I can only compare it to a hawaiian disneyland!And bite the bullet pay for the vallet parking, you get handsome hawaiian boys in skirts helping you out with your bags. You just can't cheap at this hotel.Also try my new favorite drink a lava flow. ", " Absolutely gorgeous grounds- with the variety of restaurants, attractions, pools, and walkways along the ocean you can never run out of things to do. Dolphin shows, hammocks by the sea, loved it! While I was there the tram was sort of out of service in a certain area but it wasn't a big deal- just a short walk across the beautiful grounds. ", " Originally, we had planned to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for only 2 nights since we're from O'ahu and just wanted to spend a couple days on the Big Island. Well, we enjoyed the hotel so much that we stayed 2 extra nights!The first 2 nights we were in Ocean Tower and the second 2 nights we stayed in Palace Tower. The rooms were both similar, nice and clean. In the Ocean Tower we booked a garden view room and we wound up having a view of the golf course and to the left we could see some ocean which was nice. In Palace Tower we were on the bottom floor and only had a view of a grassy hill. But the Palace Tower has a nicer entrance and lobby, and is closer to all the action. OH but if you are staying in Palace Tower there is NO laundry room, so you have to walk with your dirty laundry all the way to Ocean tower or Lagoon Tower! And the one in Ocean Tower landry room is small and overcrowed, essecially for having to accomodate both Towers.BUT, the grounds are just beautiful and are very well maintained. It's not beach front, but there's the manmade saltwater lagoon and the ocean is all around you. It's just much of the coastline of this island is lava rocks. I enjoyed the artwork in the walkways between towers. As some other people wrote, this is not a hotel for handicapped or elderly folks. Also people who don't like to walk, or hate to wait for trams/boats should not go to this particular hotel. But for us it was great! I loved taking the boat, though in a hurry it's faster to walk than wait for the boat. And a word to the wise, everything shutsdown at 1am and from then on you have to walk. We were tired after a long day of hiking the volcano and had to walk all the way back to our room because we arrived after 1a and the boat and tram were no longer operating.I keep reading reviews about the pools being cold, and I guess they were, but it didn't bother me too much. I enjoyed the slides and waterfalls in the pools. And esspecially the hot tub in the grotto area. The salt water lagoon was great! I loved seeing the turtles there and we saw them both days we snorkeled. I think they like to hang out by the waterfall and eat the algae. Also there are turtles the sun on the lava rocks by the ocean. I was surprised to see so many turtles on this island esspecially compared to O'ahu.Food. Yes the food was expensive. Expect to pay almost $30 per person for a buffet breakfast at Palm Terrace (one of the hotel's resturants). The buffet looked good, but all the food was over priced, as well as the drinks.And IBM was having an awards banquet or something during out stay so the pool was closed off, however we snuck in and had the hot tub all to ourselves (apparently IBM people don't swim or party, the supposed awards party was dead at 10pm!)Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Checking in at the front desk took a while and that guy was a little unfriendly, but everyone else was great. I would definately stay here again but I think I would eat breakfast in Waimea at the Paniolo restuarant (red w/ white trim) for a much cheaper breakfast that's just as good. I loved this hotel and am glad that we picked it. I would love to come back and relax in the hamock in the evening by a tiki torch listening to the ocean! ", " Any trip to Hawaii would not be complete without a stay or at least a visit to the Hilton Waikoloa. The staff will treat you like ohana (Hawaiian for extended family) and have always given us exceptional service. In addition to this, the hotel property is fantastic. While there are only a few restaurants on property, the food is wonderful and the views are awesome (sunsets, ocean, gardens, wildlife). Staying at the hotel is one of the best experiences you will treat yourself to. Everything is right at the hotel. Want to go snorkeling? Forget about going anywhere else. You can do that right at the hotel (and yes, it is in the ocean and its a real lagoon with open ocean fish and turtles). The property is very large, so you will walk a lot (or take the monorail or boats). Some people don't like to have to walk, but we look forward to it because it is a beautiful walk (who wouldn't want to get some exercise on vacation and enjoy incredible ocean, garden and museum walks everyday?).If you have a car, valet park it. It costs a little more, but the service is great and they can help you discover things about the island you may not otherwise know.We have been to Hawaii over 50 times and we always look forward to the vacations on the Big Island at the Hilton Waikoloa! ", " The room was great size. The grounds were kept very nice, great for walking. The pools are fantastic with slides and bar side hut in one place. Enjoyed watching the dolphins at the Dolphin Quest and at night it was peaceful to listen to them. Love to see the lighting of the tourches at night. Food was expensive but you could go near by to other establishments. One thing I didn't like was the wild (domestic) cats running around??? ", " We truly enjoyed our time at the Hilton Waikoloa. The property is not only beautiful, but we found the staff to be exceptionally friendly. This Hilton is the perfect spot for families vacationing with kids because there is sooo much to do. You could almost stay on property your entire vacation, though you should at least check out Hapuna State Park just up the road if you like beaches. It is gorgeous.Even though the mynah birds wake you up every morning, I recommend the Lagoon tower for it's proximity to everything. I felt they had the better pools as well. We had a suite on the fourth floor (4315) and it was a very nice room with plenty of space. Plus we were right across from the laundry room :)Speaking of the pools, they are chilly. We had read this in advance and brought a shortie wet suit for our son. He was very comfortable in it and I consider it $30 well spent on ebay! The lagoon water seemed warmer and we all enjoyed seeing the various tropical fish and green turtles (honu) that visited. I think the water sports rentals are on the pricey side but you can purchase a one-day pass which seemed to be a better value.We didn't mind walking the property, but do bring comfy shoes because it is sprawling. In my opinion, the only reason we didn't each gain five pounds during vacation was because of all the walking (and exploring) we did every day so I was grateful for the opportunity for some extra exercise.I highly recommend the Monchong dish at KPC. I have never had this fish before, but it was so good, we went back a second time! Book a reservation around sunset and go ahead and splurge for the professional photo. Ours came out so much better than any we took and it was nice to have one of the entire family.We found out about the dining discount card on our second day and purchased it for $29.95. It allows you 10% off at participating on-premise restaurants (including the breakfast buffet and KPC) and also comes with two $10 off coupons you can combine. It definitely paid for itself!We had a lot of help choosing exciting island activities from Cindy at the Discovering Hawaii desk. She recommended one activity in particular that everyone loved...horseback riding in the Waipi'o Valley. It was absolutely gorgeous down in the valley and the tour itself was great fun. If you book the 9:30 ride, make sure to head out early and go to Tex's Drive in for breakfast. The bavarian cream stuffed malasadas are fantastic! I wish I had one now...Don't count on room service as much of an option for dining here. The menu is really sparse and we didn't see anything terribly appealing. I think it's a good idea to plan your dinners in advance for this reason (also to get decent reservations during busy times).Some nearby restaurants we visited that I recommend include: Breakfast: Tex's Drive-in, HonokaaLunch: Tommy Bahama (in the Mauna Lani shops), The Kona Brewing Company in Kailua and The Lighthouse Deli in HawiDinner: KPC (on property), Roy's Waikoloa (right up the drive from the Hilton) and Merriman's in Waimea. All of these are on the pricey side but we enjoyed each meal tremendously.We didn't visit the spa, but I heard the massages were wonderful. There's always next time! I hope you stay at this property and enjoy your visit to Hawaii as much as we did. Aloha! ", " My family and I along with another family just returned from our trip to the Hilton Waikoloa. Our families included 3 kids, ages 3, 2, and 1. The Hilton was everything we hoped for and more! Rooms were in great shape and had everything we needed for the amount of time we spent in them. I agree with another review in that, if you're that worried about every little nick or very small blemish, you need to worry more about having fun and get out of the room more. Anyway, pools were a little chilly but definitely better as the day went on. We spent countless hours at the kiddie pool and the lagoon. Pools were great and had everything to offer every age. The lagoon was great! Great snorkeling, with turtles everywhere and lots of fish. Our room was in the lagoon tower and overlooked the dolphin pool. I recommend that room if you're willing to pay a little more. The room had a view of the dolphins and the ocean and rest of resort. My daughter loved waking up to hear the dolphins and watch them play. Aloha pass was well worth the cost for us. Drinks and breakfast everyday and discounts on many other things. We walk a lot and had no problem walking the grounds, they are beautiful and fun to look at everything. But, we did find it fun to take the tram and boat a couple times, just a good change up. Who cares if they are not fast. Your on vacation, RELAX and take in the scenery! Our favorite place was the Boat Landing Cantina. We ventured around to a couple of other resorts, but loved the Hilton more than Mauna Lani or Mauna Kea. I could write so much more, but will stop with if you like to just relax, have fun and have a lot to do in such a close vicinity, you will love the Hilton. Oh yeah and the Kings and Queens shops are right near by with so much more to do. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK NEXT YEAR!! ", " We are staying in the Ocean Towers - Ocean front- lots of walking - but the scenery is amazing so it isn't bad at all. The sunset is right over the ocean right in front of room. Rooms that are the best of ocean view are the 88-60 range ( if the 3rd floor it would be 3088) for example. Tons of activities, pools, restaurants, and great service. We are loving it here have two girls 10 and 13 and perfect for their ages! Great place to be and the sun shines here 350 days on average at this location on the big island. We were told there are 11 different climates here and this one at this location is always sunny. Great place to be for families and love it here. The birds are not that bad.... at all - we have not used ear plugs at all and we are on 3rd night. ", " I booked a 5 night stay thru HGVC and paid 999.00 for a garden view . From the moment we arrived we were in paradise. I was hesitant because we paid big bucks last year and stayed at Grand Wailea on Maui (750.00 a night for a regular room). But I must say the service was friendly the food was great and the pools and grounds were amazing!. This place FEELS like Hawaii.The walks were not bad at all... even for my 64 year old mother and my 5 year old!. Maybe not so good for the stroller crowd. But don't worry, I am a proud graduate of the stroller mom school of dragging bottles and diapers on vacation. I feel for you all... but I am here to tell you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My youngest, now 5 runs around with unlimited energy,swims without help, and for the first time in 10 years of vacations, I could just sit and watch them. Anyway... You will not be on the service level of Ritz or Four Seasons, no evian spritzes or cold towels, but you will get friendly quick poolside food and drink service with a smile. Especially at Ocean Pool. Plenty of hammocks and cabanas with amazing views for you and spouse to get away .Lagoon is a great safe beach , rent a kayak, watch the dolphin show from Lagoon grill! Warning... I am no cheap skate, but stay away from their luau. You may as well take 300 buks and flush it down the toilet. There were flies everywhere ! It's in a parking lot !!My kids were so bored we left early. Eat dinner at Donatonis. Cost 220.00 for family of four, but this was the best meal I've ever had, and they treated us like royalty on our last night in Paradise! We are going back next summer!! ", " Today\u2019s review is dedicated entirely to the Hilton Waikola \u2013 hotel, nay, resort\u2026er, make that palace.Upon arrival you enter an opulent open-air lobby where you\u2019re offered a friendly Aloha from the front-desk staff just over to the left. Parrot trainers can be found nearby with a couple of feathered hosts offering additional greetings in case you don\u2019t feel welcome enough. Once checked in you\u2019re given a map and directed to the tram (yes, tram) that will transport you to your room located in one of the hotel\u2019s various towers. Sure, you could walk, but why, when you can ride? They also provide alternative transportation in the form of a pretty sweet boat ride that resembles a replica of a `50s classic. The Hilton Waikola Village figured out that pesky lack of beach problem throughout the Big Island \u2013 they made their own! Their lagoon is fed by the Pacific Ocean. A rocky barrier prevents sharks and other unwelcome guests, but sea turtles, eels and various tropical fish are quite common, and you can rent a kayak or paddleboat to get up close. Did I mention we could see dolphins frolicking from our balcony? Yep, they have a \u201cnatural\u201d dolphin tank. I included the view at sunset. The place is kind of amazing, and we were lucky enough to get to stay there the last two nights of our trip.slacktraveler.com ", " We just stayed at Hilton Waikoloa for three weeks. We loved every minute of it. The rooms are on the large side for Hawaii hotels, and we had a room with beautiful ocean sunset views. This place is huge, so it will not appeal to everyone. If you are looking for something very quiet and low key, perhaps a bit more \"luxury\" you might want to consider Mauna Kea or Four Seasons for some understated elegance. This property is all-out fun, Hawaiian Holiday, complete with trams, boats that take you around the property, multiple pools, waterslides, a lagoon with boat rentals, a dolphin lagoon plus shopping and restaurants. We initially thought of staying in a condo, but decided against it because cooking and cleaning were not things we wanted to do on vacation. We are SO glad we chose this hotel. The rooms have small refrigerators, so we ate a lot of breakfasts in our room. We also left the property quite a bit to explore the island and go to different beaches. The days we spent on property were lots of fun. There are miles of walking/jogging paths and the property is super close and convenient to a nice grocery store, restaurants and shopping. Our two kids had a blast and never got bored. Front desk service was incredible and handled many of our questions and requests quickly and friendly. We are generally not Hilton devotees, and usually choose more luxury category hotels, but this property is really special, especially for our kids. This is definitely the best Hilton property we have stayed at. We certainly will be returning. ", " This hotel is absolutly wonderful. You can go to their website and see all the stuff they have there but I'll give you the highlights.Ate at the Dontoni's (get the mask of venice its amazing) and Kirin's. Both had great food, atmostphere and wait staff. I also ate at the Lagoon grill (not very good even for \"bar food) and the breakfast boat launch cafe ($30 for the breakfast buffett YIKES!!!).The pool and lagoons are crowded with kids most of the day but clear out after 5-6. The waterslide is pretty cool!Room in the ocean tower was spacious, comfy and very clean. It had a fridge and a safe.Getting around is easy on foot or via the tram/boat network. It has plenty to do so if you get board its your own fault!!! This placed is great.Its pretty close to the airport (20min drive) but far from volcano national park, especially if your trying to see the lava at night. ", " This is my most favorite hotel in the world! My family and I have been going to this hotel since I was about 6 years old and now I am planning to have my wedding there next May, 2008 (and I will be sure to review their wedding services afterwards!)I have nothing but the highest hopes for my wedding because of all the experiences I have had there in the past. In 2004, I visited for a week while my father attended a meeting there. There is truly nothing better than waking up in the morning and going out to sit in one of their beautiful cabanas by the lagoon. You can watch fish jump and see turtles swim by.Donatoni's is excellent but Kamuela Provision Company probably has the best view. When my fiance and I stayed there in the winter of 2006 we had a fabulous sunset dinner overlooking the pacific. It was truly incredible. We didn't mind paying for such an expensive dinner because you really can't beat the ambiance. We plan to have our wedding dinner there next year!It is a large hotel, and that is part of the fun. You can take the tram or a boat to either wing of the hotel and it is just gorgeous. I have never been to such a well-maintained and well decorated hotel. There are literally millions of dollars worth of antiques and artwork lining the halls. If you visit the Big Island, you should try to fit this into your itinerary/budget because it is truly worth every penny. ", " This is our second trip to this hotel, our first being last year. This resort is absolutely beautiful, grounds are very well maintained, pool areas always clean, and all the employees we encountered were all very friendly. We stayed in the Ocean Tower again (at our request) and had absolutely no problems with our room on the 5th floor. Never waited more than a minute for the elevators when we did take them, however, most of the time we took the stairs. Rather than take the tram to and from the lobby, we also always walked as it took less than ten minutes max. When we checked in, had problems with the key cards, had questions, and checked out, we never had to wait in line for help. Even though the resort is very large, it never felt crowded and we were there for two weeks over Easter holiday. It is funny to read constant complaints that this is resort is too large and there is just too much walking to get from place to place. Obviously these people do not read prior reviews which describe just how big the resort is or they don't bother to read the resort website itself. What exactly do they think 62 acres means? Yes the restaurants are very expensive as is said in the majority of the reviews, but there are plenty of other places to eat outside the resort area. You should rent a car on this island as there is just so much to see and do all over the entire island. If you decide to drive up to the higher elevations like to Pololu Valley or Waipio Valley, the temperature can drop more than 20 degrees and it is usually misting or raining, but the change in scenery is amazing. We also did an open range horseback ride (Paniolo Adventures) and a helicopter tour of the volcanos (Blue Hawaiian - Hilo), both were entirely worth doing. The staff at both were wonderfrul.We have no problem recommending this resort to anyone and will be returning again next year. ", " We just came home after a four night/five day stay at this resort from Apr 9-13. I was a bit worried from reading previous reviews but was surprisingly VERY happy with our entire stay at this resort. When I say resort, I mean resort! This place is HUGE, like a village unto itself. Yes, you have a lot of walking around to do, but the grounds are beautifully maintained and manicured and it's absolutely gorgeous! I mean, you're in Hawaii for goodness sake! When there's not beautiful outdoor scenery to take in, all of the hallways and corridors have amazing art and historical pieces on display. This place is like a museum in and of itself!We didn't find the walk around the resort tiring or troublesome, and I'm even pregnant! It was well worth the exceptional views of the ocean and the landscape to walk through this exceptional property to see all of the art on display.I did notice there were some loud tropical birds in one of the atrium's of the buildings which housed hotel guests, the lagoon tower, which I assume this is where most of the complaints have come from. This particular building did appear to be going through some renovation. However, we stayed in the Palace Tower which was AMAZING! Our bed was comfortable, the rooms very quiet, and the room beautiful and VERY clean. We didn't have any noisy birds outside of our hotel at all. I did walk by the lagoon tower later on another day and all of the birds were gone, it would appear that the hotel is working at resolving this issue.Overall, the kids loved the private lagoon to snorkel and play in, we LOVED the million gallon pool with water slide. This is a wonderful and outstanding place for families. The only downside is the expensive food, however, we didn't find it anymore expensive than a Westin would be. We just picked up groceries in Kailua-Kona before our arrival and had snacks and food in our refrigerator in our room. We also picked up a cheap cooler from Safeway in town and that added extra refrigeration space. This being said, we ate a couple meals poolside, but the rest of our meals were either packed sandwiches we made in our room or we'd go into Kona for a nice dinner. This way it wasn't too expensive and we were all happy. It's also nice to get out and see the island too...I'd definitely stay here again, it was one of the nicest resorts I've ever stayed at! ", " All around the property were amazingly beautiful flowers, birds, fish and people. The entire staff were a delight to interact with. Our room (Rainbow Tower) offered a beautiful view of both the downtown skyline and the saphire blue ocean. We could even seen Diamond Head crater! The property is large, but with so many beautiful things to see, it was not an inconvenience to us. There are a lot of shops conveniently located on the property, and after shopping the downtown area, we decided to make most of our purchases from the property shops. The Hilton resturants are pricey, but many other options are located just steps away. We used on-site activities planners to help book tours, and an on-site (Hertz) car rental made traveling the island very easy. I can't praise the Hilton staff enough. It was simply paradise. Happy to have been there, in WV ", " Stayed at the Waikoloa Hilton the first week in April. I was impressed with the beautiful grounds. The pools and water slides were great for the kids, and the lagoon snorkeling and sand volleyball court were also a hit (for the parents also). The restaurants at the hotel were good but very pricy. My recommendation for people who shelled out the money to get to Hawaii but want to watch the budget while there is to drive over to Waikoloa Village about six miles NE of the hotel and stock up on groceries. There is also a food court at the nearby Kings Shops just down the road from the hotel. The rooms have coffee makers and mini-refrigerators but no microwave. If you don't mind walking, it is faster than taking the electric train shuttle between parts of the hotel, but the train is useful if you have luggage. I would highly recommend the hotel for most travelers interested in a sunny destination. The weather is great on the Waikoloa part of the island, and not too far from a nice sandy beach a few miles north of the hotel, horseback riding just north of Waimea, and other sites (except the volcano, which is really tough to drive to/from in one day with time for sightseeing). I'm sure some people could be turned off by the size of this hotel, but with the variety of pools, lagoon and other activities, it is a destination in itself, especially for families with younger kids or teens. ", " After reading the reviews, I was concerned, since I was using my hard earned travel ponts for the family big week away. It got off to a rocky start, the parking guys and the front desk clerk were not of the aloha welcome standard I was expecting. But they quickly redeemed themselves with an upgrade to a royal suite. Ahhh it was sweet!!!! 5 patios. Great room, space, two bathrooms two TV's ... Dining and living areas ... did I say lots of space!!!!! Perfect for a famliy with two teen boys,our space and their space. The one week a year I take the family.....this Hilton got it right... Exec previleges for breakfast and snacks.Fruit basket and wine from the manager. Call from the front desk to check on us and offer another room we where not satified. They would not have been able to pry is out of this room. The grounds are great and very large, the lagoon area is nice, there is a great beach 5 minutes down the road in Harpuna.I agree the food and the cost is an issue. Quality is so so and cost sky high. But the Kings Shops are right down the road and they h ave a food court, so subway cost the same everywhere and was a real cheap lunch. Roys is also there and was outstanding. Chris who works in the diamond floor lounge was great!We did treat ourselves to dinner at the Provision Company at sunset. Wow to the sunset was great, the food was terrific and the cost was out of site. All in all bravo to Hotel for getting it right. ", " A beautiful hotel. I am a Diamond Hilton member and used my reward points for 6 glorious day on the Big island. The The property is huge but they have a tram or boat running every few minutes to take you wherever you want to go,But if you walk there is lots to see almost like a museum with art work etc. birds flowers on one side and the other side has many pools and the most beautiful beach you could ever see, They have porpoises which you can swim with or just enjoy watching other enjoying them. The restaurants are very expensive which is ok but the food isn't that great for the price. The Chinese restaurant was the best. Go to the luau the entertainment is worth the price. They roast a pig and have a buffett. Take the island tour it takes you to the volcano to tour and have a delicous buffet at the top. It stops at 6 different stops including the coffee factory with free coffee. I would definietly go back but you do have to rent a car because other then the hotel ther is not a lot to do in the area, ", " We recently stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and it was truely amazing! We moved from the Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort (that is booking rooms to unsuspecting guests while under major construction) after the first night and there was no comparison! The Hilton is the place to stay in Waikoloa, Hawaii! When you arrive they have about a dozen bellhops ready to assist you with your bags and park your car. The front desk staff were helpful and courteous and the accomodations were awesome! This property is over a mile long so you catch a ride to your room on a boat or tram. It was so much fun! When we checked into our room we heard music and it became louder as we got closer to our balcony doors. We opened up the doors and couldn't believe it....FOREIGNER was in concert! We were thrilled that we could watch them from our front row seats on our balcony! We had our children with us and there was so much for them to do. We swam in the lagoon, and the kids loved the water slides at all the pools. We absolutely loved the dolphins! The kids liked going for walks around this beautiful place and enjoyed the hammocks too! We would have liked to have stayed another week! We can't wait until next year! This was a fantastic vacation! ", " My wife and I stayed for our second time at the fantastic resort, Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island. We had stayed for the prior week at the Kaanapali Beach Club in Maui, which also was wonderful. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member, so I was able to redeem points for three nights in a garden view room.When I arrived, the very nice receptionist asked me if I would prefer an ocean view room on the concierge level, where I could also watch the whales. Of course, I jumped at the opportunity. She also informed me that I could have other amenities because I was a diamond member.Every one was very kind and helpful along the way. Unfortunately, my wife got the flu, and that is a terrible thing to happen while on vacation in Hawaii. But at least there was a doctor in residence at the hotel. And even though she spent most of her time in the room, she could look out the balcony and see the whales around 50 yards off shore.On our last day, my wife was feeling better, so we went to the lagoon. We rented a kayak and saw several Green Hawaiian Sea Turtles and many fish in the lagoon. We also got a kick out of watching the dolphins. It was a shame that the Kona pool was closed, but is should be open by now, and looks great for those who will be coming. All in all, it is a great resort with a great vibe. ", " This property, to put it simply, is the preimere Big Island property that won't cost you $500 or more a night. The staff was helpful, the grounds were lush, everything was truly amazing. Our \"standard\" room was huge and I was happy with housekeeping. The pools were amazing and the spa was HUGE. Sure they are going under minimal renovations, but that is necesary to keep it up to par. I mean so what, you have to walk a little bit because of tram renovations, YOU'RE IN HAWAII ON THE BIG ISLAND, just walk slowly and take it all in. Our entire family was very happy with the resort, and those other reviews are just too picky. Overall, VERY HAPPY! ", " After having read most all of the reviews, I feel compelled to write. If I had not been to this resort 10 years ago, I might have been reluctant to return based on the negative reviews. Our first visit was filled with AWE!!! We have never really seen such opulence and beauty all on one property. My Mother didn't want to ever leave. The food was wonderful, the grounds beautiful, the people gracious!! We have made 11 trips to Hawaii and seem to always compare all resorts and experiences to the Waikoloa Village. It seems to meet all our needs. The spa is great, the restaurants are so convenient and wonderful, the grounds can not compare, the hammocks and cabanas are Heaven on Earth. After my Mother died, it seemed appropriate to return to the Place that we had all been so happy together... so the very first Thanksgiving after her death, we returned with my Daughter, her husband, our Granddaughter and my Husband. The wonderful memories that this place brought back started me on the process of healing and dealing with my loss. Budda Point was a nightly event for all of us and we continued that tradition of watching the sunset and treasuring the beauty of our Earth. I could just remember all the joy. We had Thanksgiving feast (2003) at the Ballroom and there was no way to improve on the fantastic food and ambience. This was the first time ever that I had celebrated a holiday away from home and it was bittersweet, but made so much better by the wonderful food and service in such a fantastic setting.My husband does not travel much with us, but based on the terrific time that we had in 2003 watching our Granddaughter swim with the Dolphins, eating at all the restaurants, and relaxing and smiling for the first time in months.. all he wanted to do was go back \"one more time\" before our granddaughter was too old to go with us... So we returned this January and it still was all that anyone could hope for. If you go with an open mind that it is not cheap to travel, that will help. I did see a lot of people carrying food into the resort, but all that you need is available to you there. The prices compare with any luxury resort and the room rate is very reasonable. This property is similar to the Four Seasons grounds and their rates are triple for the room. The rooms have been upgraded and have very nice mattresses and pillows with down duvet covers for the bedspread. Room service was very good, everything that we asked for (or didn't have to ask for) was provided. We had room service for breakfast and it was hot and good. Kameau Provision Company (KPC) was out of this world! We ate at sunset, watched the whales, walked the grounds after the torches were lit. Kirin's was very good (we ate there at lunch) and Donatoni's is delicious. Imari's is just a fun choice when you have children with you ... the teppanaki grill is entertaining and delicious! We had made arrangements for a photographer (Photos' by Glen) local... to come to the resort to take pictures of our granddaughter on the fabulous grounds. That will be a memory of a lifetime.. and they turned out wonderful... The travel service on property booked our snorkel tour and helicopter tour of the volcano and it was everything that they recommended! The Walmart in Kona had a great selection of souvenirs and we made a stop there before leaving the final day! Even with all the beauty of the island, our best days were the days on the resort! If you are going to relax and not worry about having what you need available to you, this is the place!! If you want to save money, stay home. It does cost a lot, but it is VALUE for your money!! This is definitely one of the nicest, most relaxing places in the USA!!! If you are prone to find fault, I imagine that you can find it whereever you go, but it seems to me that it would be HARD to find much wrong here. I would recommend this resort to anyone that I know... I just wish that it were closer! Hopefully, I can return with all of my children and grandchildren one day!! That would be the DREAM trip for our family! Aloha!! ", " To be truthful, I was afraid of what I got my fiance and I in to by choosing to stay at this resort (based on all of the questionable /negative feedback found while researching).But, it was heaven!The grounds were meticulous and lushly landscaped! The art was unbelievable! Concierge was more than accomodating! Our room was spacious and immaculate, and our mountain view was breath-taking.I found myself taking a lot more pictures than I thought I would....you just want to capture every beautiful sight, and trust me, it is all around you, everywhere you turn.We chose to really get around the island during our 7 night stay. We found great beaches, lava pools, waterfalls, farmers markets, and great local eats. If you're not so adventurous, you can completely soak up the beauty and amenities right at the Hilton. This place is Huge (hence the tram and boat service). We enjoy walking so we pretty much walked everywhere within the resort However, I did get tired of all the walking. You can literally get miles of walking in at this resort.For food, yes, food costs a small fortune here but I think most of us would agree that portions are usually too large for 1 person to eat so we shared several of our meals to help keep costs down. We at at all of the restaurants, except Imari, Donatoni's, & Kirin. Our favorite meal was at Kamuela Provision Company. We didn't have a poor dining experience during our entire stay. Even the sushi at Waikoloa Shopping Center was Fabulous! We found great thai food in Hilo, and a rockin' ahi sandwhich in Kona.We did do the Luau at the Hilton. It was an experience we'll never forget. So many memories.....Well, I hope this post was helpful. We loved our visit to Hilton Waikoloa Village. I hope to go back year after year. I'll post some pic's for your reference ", " This was the best Hotel I've stayed. A Really Big Hotel in the amazing Big Island of Hawaii. We were welcomed by a sympathetic parrot named Chris\u00b4, after a quickly check-in we took a monorail (Yes, monorail, there's a 15-minutes walking to reach your room) to our wonderful room. The rooms are very clean, the pools amazing, the \"lake\" that was actually filled with the pacific waters stunning; friendly staff, everything was perfect! ", " We stayed here for the second time last week, five nights. Once again - enjoyed the property.Bad points first:1) The birds in the Ocean Tower are very loud. But they do not scream all night and we got used to them. After all in Hawaii - got to deal with some outdoor wildlife.2) Pricing is high, even though we knew this, $30 for the buffet per person was a bit high. No way we can eat that much breakfast.3) One night we ordered room service the lady seemed a bit rushed-rude on taking the order, but food was fine and service was faster than promised.4) One pool was closed, so no real water slide available.5) Our room (Ocean 4093) is not as advertised, no chance you can see any ocean from it and not worth the upgrade cost.Good Points:1) Valet was very accommodating, as they should be. But nice how they tried to treat you unique with the size of the crowd they have.2) Food was great every night that we ate on site. Also ate twice at Roy's. That place is great.3) Had one little creature (lizard) near the bathroom, maybe he was the reason, but unlike our last visit, no ants noticeable this visit. We left him alone, he always ran away when we came near.Overall the hotel was as nice as we remembered and the staff very accommodating. No complaints worth mentioning, other than way too far to drive into Kona. However there is a new development going in and hopefully this will add some choices to the area. ", " 1- THE WALK:Walking from one side of the hotel to the other is not a problem, unless you have some sort of disability. It takes a while and can be tiring, but the walkways are very beautiful. We never waited long enough for transportation to think it is taking too long. Walking from one building to the next takes very little time. One tip: Stay in the Ocean Tower if you want to have quick access to the buffet breakfast.2- GROUNDS:Are awesome, high class. It is amazing what they have built over rock! Except for areas under construction, the hotel was very clean. They have hammocks in between palm trees by the Ocean Tower and when I got on one, looking upwards to the palm trees, blue sky and the breeze, I thought \u201cI am in heaven on earth\u201d. Some areas do need a little bit of face lifting.3- BIRDSThere are many birds on the grounds and they are probably the only downside to this place. They scream like in a horror movie all the time, but thankfully it wasn\u2019t too bad during bed time. They are a part of the restaurants as well and if you leave your food open to get something from the buffet, you will come back to a table full of birds on it.4- ROOMSGood size, clean and quiet. Unfortunately they don\u2019t have a welcoming smell as you enter but not a biggie. Bed very comfortable.5- FOOD COSTFood is high priced but not over the top EXCEPT: if you ever think of taking the Thanksgiving Buffet, be aware: For 3, we paid $227! This is the only sour point for me during the entire stay. God, $227, still hurts! If you are rich and this is small change though, it is worth it.6- STAFFKind and nice, they do not go way out of their way but nice.CONCLUSION:I will go back there some day and sleep on those hammocks again! If you are a couple newly in love, this place is one you will certainly enjoy. ", " We had a 10 day stay here at the end of November and we had a great time. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this place easily held its own against other big hotels.The food at all the restaurants was very good, the only negative being the price. But Kings Shops was within a 20 min walk (or trolley ride) and we went to Roys (v.good) and had take away fish and ships by the lake (good and v.cheap!)We much prefer sitting at a beach to sitting round a pool and we took the 15 min walk along the front to the 'A' bay which is a lovely beach and superb for swimming. Sunsets were mostly spent around buddha point where its lovely and quiet.Having read previous reviews I was preparing myself for rude staff and a fair bit of litter but ALL the staff that we met, be it front desk, at the towel points, at the restaurants, the putting course or the cleaners were all extremely friendly and happy to chat. We never saw any rubbish/litter and we saw staff in the boat canals every day cleaning out weeds, they never smelt bad (the canals that is!). We had a great honeymoon here and would happily come back. Its such a large place that some areas are great for kids but if you want quiet its east to find that too. ", " Let's start with the downsides which others have mentioned as well. The resort is very large with 3 towers that are connected by a tram, boat or walkway. The tram always seems to be at the opposite end from where you are and going the other way meaning you can wait quite a while. The boats seem to run more regularly (they have several) but are not great if you have luggage as there really is no place for luggage. When we had to be somewhere it almost always came down to walking. From our room to the lobby it probably was a 5-7 minute walk, 10-15 minutes from end to end. But if you go to Hawaii you shouldn't be in a rush. And if you pay the room rates at the Hilton I would suggest you can afford the few dollars to have the bell staff deal with your luggage. Check in, dump your bags and let the vacation begin. The staff will help you in any way possible from the moment you arrive and we had nothing but friendly but effiicient service in every area. When you are leaving, call them again and your bags are gone.Where the Fairmont is refined elegance the Hilton is a Disney-inspired getaway. Every tower has it's own pool and restaurant and it's own small attraction (birds, fish, near the lagoon, etc). The various pools go from typical pool to one with a waterfall, big waterslide and cave-like areas. Oh, and then there are the dolphins and also the boats you can take out on their waterways.Food also is more family friendly- lots of snack-bar like options but also Japanese and Chinese food and the Kamuela Provision Company for locally inspired food. None of it is great but you can find a setting that's right for whatever you need. Go to the Fairmont for great food for the adults.If you want a relaxing, fun, getaway the Hilton is a great choice. It has all the comforts and service of a great hotel along with lots of fun and relaxing activities for your island getaway. ", " Very few hotels are perfect and remember your on the big island of hawaii where you can have a grass shack on the beach with no running water and still live well......The hilton waikoloa is a special place and the free boat and tram rides to your hotel allows you to see, feel, and enjoy paradise. ", " My wife and I just returned from a week at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at Waikoloa Beach on the Big Island of Hawaii. This time share property was recently completed in the last year and is sometimes referred to as Kohala Suites. It is adjacent the Bay Club at Waikoloa which is also managed by Hilton but not developed by Hilton. We very much enjoyed this HGVC property. We are a time share owner through the sister firm Fiesta Americana in Cabo San Lucas. The units are all 2 bedrooms and are very nicely appointed with the latest amenities, granite countertops, nice baths, washer dryer, balcony, flat screen TV etc. These 2-3 story building have lots of parking close to the unit and nicely landscaped grounds overlooking the golf course. The property has a medium size pool with slide, water spouts and hot tub. Staying at HGVC enables access at no additional charge to the Hilton Waikaloa Hotel facilities (pool etc.) which is located on the ocean about 1 mile away. I believe staying at the Bay Club involves an $80 per day extra family charge for the same Hilton access. The location is excellent. We found the staff to be very helpful. ", " We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. They did not upgrade our room, but they did give us a king sized bed, and a lovely bottle of sparkling wine & 2 glasses.We stayed in the Lagoon tower: nearest to the lobby, so convenient, though did get wakened a couple of days by the hordes of tropical birds in the trees by the tower.We used the monorail a lot, and the boat occasionally (as slower and less frequent). Both great!We loved the artwork in the walkway, and the double hammocks & the gardens. We ate at: The Lagoon Grill - good for watching the hotel dolphins, nice cocktails & pizza to share.Donatelli's - very nice Italian food & Venetian decor, and they gave me a free tiramisu as it was my birthday.Kirin's - tasty Chinese food and nice decor.All very good once you accept the restaurants are a bit overpriced compared with all the others on the Island.We self-parked, which is $7 a night (valet is $15 a night + tip). It was about 100 yards to our car from the lobby (amazed by previous reviews saying it was 5-10 mins walk away). ", " Kudos to the hotel and it's staff for the way they handled the earthquake. If ever I have to experience an earthquake again -- I hope I am at the Hilton. ", " I have to say this is my favorite of all the hotels I have stayed. I just returned from my 2nd stay, and it was just as wonderful as the first. I stayed in the Lagoon Tower which had wonderful ocean views and you can even see the dolphins playing in their pool!I found the staff very helpful, never had a problem. The resort is huge and you have many opportunites to get around. You can walk, take the tram or even to boat. I did all three daily!I am really sick of other people on this site complaining about the hotel because of it's size. You can tell from their website and other people thats it's a big hotel, and so what you have to wait 5 mins. for the train, your supposed to be on vacation!! Plus there are benchs through out the hotel so sit back. Also don't like the long walk to your car, use valet thats what its there for!! The resturants are expensive, but food quailty was always great, and the buffet breakfast was $26 not $36 as said in a previous post, and it was very good. I would reccommend going into Kona for some cheaper food, but try the itailian resturant at least once at the hotel it was quite good.Overall I love this hotel, it's big fun, you can spend a whole week there a never get bored. I would definatly reccommend anyone to stay there and will return again next year! ", " We just finished our second stay at the Hilton and were not dissapointed. I am a Hilton Hhonors Diamond member and believe me I was treated like one. Although the hotel was 100% booked, they still upgraded me to an oceanfront room in the Lagoon Tower overlooking the dolphins. In fact, the staff at the front desk bent over backwards to find me the room I wanted. She was originally was going to put us in the Ocean tower on the executive level were the complementary lounge is (free breakfast, mid-day and evening snacks, etc). When I indicated my preference in staying in the Lagoon tower, she provided us with coupons for both my wife and I for free breakfast every morning in lieu of having access to the lounge. Each coupon was worth $13 towards any breakfast selection on the menu. Not only that, it also included taxes and gratuity. We were both able to eat a full breakfast of eggs, meat, hashbrowns and toast each morning without paying a cent. What a perk! Other perks we received included: nightly turn down service with mints and an orchid blossom left on our bed (without having to request it), a plate of fresh fruit left in our room on the first night, complimentary in-room coffee (normally they charge you $4.50 per package - they left us 14 packets for our six night stay!), complementary parking (they normally charge $7.50 per day), and free access to the spa and excercise facilities.Staff: As I mentioned earlier, the front desk staff were great. All other Hilton staff we encountered were very friendly and professional. Our only negative experience was with one of the women working in a clothing store in the Lagoon tower. She was very snotty!Parking: Although the hotel was booked to capacity, we never had a problem finding a spot. People who complain about the long walk are a bunch of whiners. It's not that far.Restaraunts: We didn't eat at any of them (too expensive) other than the Boat Landing one night. We mostly ate at the food court in the Kings shops, or not at all. We each had a tropical drink at the pool one day - with tip they were $22 - yikes! The birds at the Orchid Cafe were also annoying as they would flock to a table to eat the leftovers as people left. Nothing the Hilton can control as some of the guests were encouraging them by feeding them.Rooms: Nicer than I remembered from my first vist. Although they were recently remodeled. Good sized room, nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable with a down comforter. I slept very well! The room also includes a small refrigerator so you can store your snacks and drinks. We picked up water, beer and snacks at a grocery store before checking in. Must cheaper than purchasing drinks at the resort. As I mentioned earlier, our room overlooked the dolphins. What great entertainment. We could sit on our lanai and watch the trainers feed and work with them. TIP: To get a room like ours, request a room on the 4th, 5th or 6th floor - room number 09-14.Pools/Grounds/Ect: The resort was just as nice as remember it - very clean and manicured. They were repairing the lagoon waterfall and the adjacent path while we were there. Other than that, everything was fully functional. The only thing showing a little wear was the Kona pool. Some of the tiles were missing and there was grime in certain spots. Minor complaint.Overall, it was a great stay. I highly recommend becoming a Hilton Hhonors member, as the perks are fantastic. Way to go Hilton! ", " I am a firm believer in the saying \"you get what you pay for\" and the Hilton Waikoloa Village is no expection. I have stayed at the hotel several times and even had my wedding there based on how wonderful our first stay was. I have one major bonus most people don't have, I live here in Hawai'i and was able to see what the resort was like prior to booking. Here are the facts:Parking - Is now $7 for self and $14 for valet. The self parking is usually pretty full, however I have never not been able to find a stall that wasn't close. For valet parking you must have your slip otherwise it's around $35-they have to contact the rental car company...etc to ensure it's your rental car which is a hassel but for your own safetyCheck in/out - Each time our rooms have been ready early and for our wedding we checked in 4 hours early which was a major plus. Checking out takes about 10-15 minutes when you have room charges.Room Service - Is about standard pricing for the Big Island and the food is worth it. Note: it usually takes between 30-45 minutes for your food to arrive.Rooms - the standard rooms are nice and are kept mold free-which shows they're cleaned and kept up since mold grows in Hawaii like crazy. The ocean views are great, no matter what floor you're located on.Pools - Are usually filled with kids during the summer months/weekends/holidays however aren't over crowded by any means. There are several pools throughout the resort so you're not stuck at just one which is nice. The adult pool is very relaxing. There are snack bars/cafes for food and drinks which is great if you don't want to leave the pool/lagoon area.Note: The resort DOES NOT have a beach which is clearly stated however most people doesn't pay attention. There is \"A Bay\" which is a small sandy bay near by. The Big Island is known for it's rocky coastline- meaning there are some beaches you just have to drive to them and 4 wheel drive is sometimes required.Lagoon - Great for snorkeling/people who aren't used to the rocky shore like of the Big Island. Tons of fish and the sea turtles basically swim up to you. There are places for the rental gear on site which makes it quick and easy.The property - Very relaxing for people who aren't in any kind of hurry and just want to enjoy their vacation. The property is spread out and beautiful. It's great for anyone who enjoys a quiet walk especially during the evening.Trams/boats - Are running from early morning until 1am I believe. Due to letting people on/off the timing isn't exact (sometimes it's 5 minutes between trams/boats and othertimes it's longer) however by all stops there are seating areas/chairs.Dining - Again, you get what you pay for and the Hilton is dedicated to bringing the best so the prices are a little high-but nothing uncommon to the Big Island. Note: the Orchid Cafe does take a long time since they share their kitchen with the room service kitchen.Weddings - The resorts wedding planner Kai is just awful! We're already planning another ceremony to make up for it- and we've only been married a month!If you're in a rush or just have a faster pace lifestyle the Hilton Waikoloa is not for you. This resort is basically for people whowant to get away and relax. The property in a way is a small Big Island - throughout the hallways you can see the art of old Hawai'i, the waterfall in the swimming area, the lagoon with it's sealife, the lush green areas, the Luau with it's traditional food and dancers, and the general feeling of being laid back. That is very much the Big Island of Hawai'i ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa from August 6 through August 11th, 2006 and from beginning to end it was amazing! We stayed in the Ocean Tower with a breathtaking view of the ocean. We had a suite which was HUGE... an entryway, living room + \"dining\" room table, mini-bar, 2 big TVs, huge bedroom with desk, large bathroom with 2 sinks, seperate shower, bathtub and toliet in a small private room. The sheets were quality (200 or 300 thread count) and the down duvet was soft and comfy. Our patio was very long, extending from the living room area all the way down to the bedroom area. Housekeeping was great, replenishing towels and toiletries (giving us lots of extras). Loved getting the USA Today newspaper on my doorstep every morning as well!The resort is very large, but since I was on vacation, it was not a problem, since I was not in a hurry to get anywhere. Used the tram a few times, but it was not air-conditioned so we preferred to walk most times (besides the view is to die for)! There are several pools, a huge waterslide at one (even for us big kids!), a lagoon where you can swim, snorkle and play with the sea turtles who are so sweet and gentle. You can also swim with the dolphins (for a price) but you must reserve way in advance. We ate at Donatoni's (Italian) and Kamuela Provision Company (Steaks and fish).... both are very expensive, yet very good food at both. Drink prices are very expensive too... $10 for a pina colada and we spent about $65 for two cheeseburgers and two drinks at the Lagoon Grill (granted, the burgers were delicious --thick and juicy but come on, they're hamburgers! That was a bit ridiculous).So impressed by our trip so far, I asked my husband if this was a 5 star hotel...he said he wasn't sure. We had left some dishes outside of our front door in the morning, and upon returning that night they were still there. We both turned to each other and laughingly said \"Not a 5 star hotel!\" BUT, it's very close... 4.5 stars! Will DEFINITELY return and can't wait to go back! ", " I lived on the Island of Hawaii for 9 months and decided to leave in 2001. As a send-off I afforded myself a night at this resort. WHAT A GREAT PLACE! Do not pass GO, Do not collect $200 -- just stay here if you're visiting the Big Island!! \"That's all I have to say about that.\" ", " The hospitality at the Hilton Waikoloa is outstanding. Every single person on staff is professional, helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have. The views at this resort are breath taking and it is easy to book excursions - I'd highly recommend Red Sail Sports and Sunshine helicopter tours. From the moment we landed at Kona airport, a sense of relaxation and calm followed us everywhere. Traveling around this resort is a breeze using the tram and boats with the friendly staff but make time to walk the property to view the historic artwork and lush gardens. We can't wait to return. Mahalo to the staff at Waikoloa Village. ", " Oh my goodness! This property leaves me BREATHLESS! What ever I say will not even do this place justice! Seriously this is an AMAZING hotel. It is located on the Kohala Coast which is about 30 minute drive from Kona (only bummer is that if you have to drive this long to get some affordable food otherwise you eat the delicious but expensive resort restaurant food). In my humble opinion it is the best resort out of all on the coast.The hotel has a tram and a boat straight out of Disneyland to transport you to your room as well as shopping and other activities. There's 3 towers of guest rooms which span the whole property. Seriously, you could walk from one end of the hotel to the other and get your daily excercise --- it is that big. We walked in to a lobby with fruit punch and a lady doing the hula - very cool. There are 5 or more pools - Gorgeous Idyllic and full of kids in the summer (except for the adult pool). The largest has 4 water falls cascading into it with a covered cave lagoon,(Hugh Hefner style) waterslides(yes even for adult use) and several hot tubs tucked into corners with 1 tub with a heated waterfall- no I am not kidding. Their lagoon has sea turtles swimming in it. Rent a paddle boat or even TRAIN DOLPHINS! You could spend your entire vacation in this resort. The restaurants are DELICIOUS but be prepared to pay a pretty penny. The property is decorated with some amazing art work which you could spend a few hours just admiring. The grounds are immaculate with gorgeous flowers. Our room was AMAZING. We were on the top floor overlooking the golf course which was still an amazing view. As we stepped out, we overlooked this gorgeous garden with ponds, birds etc... The only problem was that it took us so long to get from our room to the lobby and to our car so make sure you factor that into your stay. We had a GIGANTIC room! King size bed VERY comfortable with soft sheets, lots of soft pillows and a down comforter. Walk in closet but smaller than expected bathroom. We had a deck with chairs and a table too. I was extremely pleased with the room but wished that we had an empty fridge. We ended up actually buying a styrofoam cooler which we just took to the beach with us during the day. The restaurants are top notch but we couldn't afford to eat there every day so I would strongly suggest scheduling time to eat some meals in town (Costco pizza is cheap!) and also buying some snacks so you don't pay so much at the hotel when you get your midnight cravings. Their most affordable restaurants were yummy but still pricey at average 8.00 for lunch. One dinner bill was $140.00 but it was some out of this world steak and fish.The staff was OKAY. The guest services staff, bartenders, restaurant employees and conceierge throughout the entire hotel were EXTREMELY friendly and the epitome of quality service. They were friendly and knowledgable. I can't say the same for their Bell men/Valet people (not the most helpful) or the front desk. The main lobby front desk women were often rude and my husband and I had to struggle with our luggage because the valet boys were so busy socializing and paying attention to the valet. We wondered if they even had anyone helping to get guests and their luggage to their rooms.We were on our honeymoon and would definately reccommend this hotel to anyone who can afford it. If you are planning on doing other activities outside of the hotel, spend at least 7 days here. Serioulsy you won't regret it. It's in a great location. Secluded, close to some gorgeous beaches. Anyone and everyone should experience this once in their lives. This is also a perfect place for families. There are TONS of things for kids to do - day camp with very fun activities. I felt it was essential to have a rental car especially since we did some fun activities like volcano park, flumin da ditch and drove around hilo, snorkeled down south etc.... Also, I needed to drive to the Kings Shops which is located on this property. Kings Shops is like an outdoor shopping mall with stores selling mostly local items, restaurants and most importatly a STARBUCKS!!! The whole experience was 100% Perfect. They thought of everything when designing this hotel! BRAVO! ", " We have just returned from an unforgettable 5 day vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and it was beautiful! Waterfalls that you could swim through,a 175 foot waterslide,and a pool filled with sand,like a beach were all included. To get around you have to take either the train or the boat, I mean what do you expect?,to walk 64 acres?Exotic Parrots,tropical fish and other unbelieveable creatures were around you if you took a short walk. The beaches were good plus if you looked down you can see sea turtles and all kinds of tropical fish to look at.There were dolphin encounter programs that you could only do if you were a guest at this hotel. If you want an unforgettable hotel and vacation the Hilton Waikoloa Village is a must. ", " Great Place! Beautiful. Quiet! Relaxing. Spent 10 days. Hotel was 80% occupancyExpensive? Duhhh... It's a resort ,... in Hawaii. Of course it is and should be.Beautiful grounds? Yes. Great for picture taking.Pools: very niceGetting around resort. You can walk this resort in 15minutes, 10 minutes at a brisk walk. Any able bodied person that complains about walking these beautiful grounds should go home. Employee attitude: Very good. We never had any problems.Restaurants: Excellent ", " My favorite hotel in the world. I have been lucky enough to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village four times, and I hope to go back next month! Outstanding five star resort with an incredible spa on hotel grounds. The hotel lagoon offers incredible snorkeling and relaxing kayaking. Wonderful and extremely large pool with something for everyone. Excellent restaurants within hotel grounds. There is no reason to leave the hotel! ", " Hay everyone,We arived at the Hilton and we first thought it was sooo immense. We walked strolled swam rode the tram, rode the boats, ate at all the resturarants, had breakfast delivered, ate at the cafe, drank pina colada until the wee hours. By the way that was day one.... Yes there is so much to do there. It's a cool area with beautiful artwork to peruse It just has it all! Our rooms were fabulous didnt matter where you were put there is a view of something. If you just hate it they will move you. We have been alot of places and this FELT like a real vacation and get away. For people who are impatient, and dont like to wait for things like trams and boats. You wouldnt like it here as you have some waiting to do at times. We just grabbed a couple of cool drinks and just enjoyed the scenery. It is on the ocean but there isnt a beach. They have somekind of manmade one I guess, and they have a dolphin pond. At dusk the drums start to beat and the native runs from touche to touche with his flam blazing lighting them up while he runs the whole resort. The only thing I found not so good was the pools are cold in December and there were alot of shops, resturants closed during our stay. It just didnt bother us at all. It was much too nice for a complaint from us. Then unfortunately we flew to Maui.... Dont wast your time just go to South Florida instead. Anyway, we stayed at the part of the Waikaloa called the Ocean tower. Good things are the rooms are very nice and also the staff. There is a little bar and cafe in that area. The far tower at the other end of the resort had the slides, jacuzzi tubs and the coffe bar. But you get a free boat ride all over and its just cool. There are hammocks to lay in plenty of chairs to sit in etc. There is a Walmart on the island to get additional stuff and a grocery. I didnt think the prices were that bad there. I loved it and would go back again. In fact I am going back in Jan2007. It will be fabulous.......Wendylee Wine ", " I stayed with my two daughters for a week from July 5. We had such a wonderful time. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member and I had booked an ocean view room. We were upgraded to the top floor of the Ocean Tower. The Executive room was great for breakfast and for a before dinner snack. The hotel room was over looking the ocean and very big.  The resort is spread out on 62 acres and there is plenty of transportation if you don't like to exercise. They have a tram that runs every 10 minutes and a boat that runs every 15 minutes. There are 3 towers, The Ocean, the Palace and the Lagoon. Each tower was connected on the tram and boat and there were restaurants spread out through the property.. The pools were fabulous and you never had to fight for a seat. There was even a Dolphin Quest ( swim with the dolphins.) I would highly recommend this hotel. ", " We had a great experience at the Hilton. We not only were treated like royalty but the grounds were incrediable. The staff was helpful and the pools were out of this world. Our travel agent shorted us one room but we paid for two rooms and the staff at the Hilton was very accomedating up grading us to two ajoining ocean view rooms. We are already planning our trip back. ", " WOW! This is a destination. The Kohala Coast of the Big Island averages over 350 days of sunshine every year. This is a huge complex but it's not overwhelming. There's a monorail tram and boat fleet to move people around. It's sounds hoky but it works here without being over the top. The grounds are incredible. Two big pool complexes in the Lagoon Tower and Ocean Tower. The pools are open late. The hotel is ocean front but doesn't have a natural beach so Hilton built there own. The Lagoon is remarkable. All the benefits of the beach but protected so it's great for kids (and adults) who don't have the battle the waves. But the best is the ability to snorkel in this protected environment. As it's open to the sea you get a get assortment of tropical fish. I even had two green turltes swim by. Guests also share the Lagoon with the Dolphins at Dolphin Quest. You don't have the pay the price to watch and enjoy these beautiful creatures. There's a bar and grill immediately adjacent to the Laggoon where you can enjoy watching them.If you want to sun by the pool but overlook the ocean head to the Ocean Tower pool complex. Great ocean breeze and the pool right at hand.Our room in the Ocean Tower was Lagoon and Ocean view. It was big, very clean and very well appointed. You get simple little things like a light in the big closet and plenty of complimentary Kona Blend coffee left for you. The staff was attentive and helpfull.Plenty of dining options but nothing is really cheap. Still the choices are good and the value is good given the cost. Words really do not do this property justice. We have stayed at resorts worldwide and this one is in the top 5. Given the cost was $215 per night purchased on line, the value is very good. We went into the Fairmont, Mauna Kea and Four Seasons for dinner and didn't see anything we thought better than what we had and we didn't pay $350 a night. We will go back! (Soon I hope.) ", " We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights as the last stop on a 3 week tour of Hawaii. We left Hilo and took the beautiful highway 19 road to the Kona side. We stopped off at several places but guess you could drive between Hilo and Waikoloa in about 1.h - 2 hours. 1) Location: The resort has been cleverly built around a bay and makes use of the sweeping ocean so there is stunning views across the grounds and the ocean from most of the hotel. It is about 30 mins from Kailua-Kona and Waimea where there are more restaurants and grocery stores. 2) Valet Parking: The resort was busy when we arrived at 2pm but the valet staff quickly unloaded all our baggage and said that they would deliver it to our room after we checked in. We were informed about the charge for valet parking $15.00 and the charge for self parking $7.50 and (unlike the Grand Wailea were given an option - I decided to use the valet.3) Checkin - There was a 5 min wait but I don't find this unreasonable given the large number of guests they had at least 10 agents. I'm a Hilton Honours member and had booked a deluxe ocean view executive floor room which are located on the 5th and 6th floors of the ocean tower. At 2pm our rooms were ready and almost as soon as we arrived at our room our baggage arrived - very quick considering the distance.4) Room - Very impressed with the room. Comparable size with the Grand Wailea but for $200 less! Large comfortable king bed offset in a corner giving the room a different feel. Neutral / tropical decor and obviously been rennovated as was clean and had a large flat screen TV that we could see from the sofa and the bed. Large entrance with huge closet to store baggage away. We had a fridge as well as a minibar. Bathroom was small but clean, and large countertop, and powerful multifunction shower-spray. Would have been nice to have a separate shower but was not a problem Nice toiletries.Spectacular view of the ocean and the palm trees from a nice size lanai (not as big as Grand Wailea but more private) and not overlooking other guest rooms as at Grand Wailea.5)Cool In-room hi-fi that you could hook an MP3 player or laptop, and played CDs.6) Large comfortable desk with high speed internet access but this costs $15/24 hours7) Grounds: I found this to be the most relaxing and beautiful resorts. There is a mile long museum walkway that has so many odd pieces of art and connects all the towers. In addtion there are numerous walkways, bridges, and staues dotted about the immaculate grounds. You could spend ages reading all the plaques about the flowers and plants. The resort definately has an asian feel to it which I liked. There were many pools at both ends of the resort and a huge lagoon fed from the ocean in the centre. I actually love the size of the resort as unlike the Grand Wailea it was never noisy or crowded. It was always possible to find pool chairs at any time of the day. Our favourites were the mini-cabana which were dotted along the ocean walkway ainly in front of the ocean tower - very romantic and private - despite being in a huge resort you really do feel like you are away from it all (I could not find this feeling at all at the Grand Wailea. The pools were certainly not as elaborate as the Grand Waileas but they were still fun and would rate the pools better here. We enjoyed watching the dolphins most evening in their lagoon.8) Dining: I found that the price of food in the restaurants to be high but no higher than on Maui. The quality and variety is good - particularly the Dim Sum at lunch and Imari the Japanese restaurant for dinner.We wore shorts and t-shirts everywhere for dinner and felt comfortable so i don't know where people feel they have to dress up (we're from the UK so know about having to dress up!)9) Executive Lounge: Unfortunately this was the only negative part of the stay. The executive lounge is way too small for the number of guests. The way it is laid out makes it very cramped and it just doesn't feel right. We don't have a problem with kids but there did sem to be a greater number of familes than couplesusing the lounge and they appeared to use the lounge more like an all you can eat buffet. On several occassions we had to leave the lounge and eat on tables that they had put on the landing outside and even on the stairwell! We are HHoners members and have stayed in several Hilton Executive rooms and felt that this was the worse lounge we had used. I would not recommend paying the extra for an executive lounge unless you are a family of 4 when I suppose if you used it as a buffet it would probably save you money.After now visiting all 4 main islands I really enjoyed the Big Island the most. It has the most amazing contrasts between dry lava deserts, huge mountains, lush scenery, waterfalls, even a california style ranch town that seems like your not in Hawaii any more. It is definately the most 'local' of the islands and not a place to party, but if you want to enjoy stunning scenary that you will not see anywhere else, perfect weather (on one side of the island) and a stunningly beutiful tropical resort to relax after all the touring then this place will not disappoint you. We will be returning here again soon! ", " Hilton Waikoloa village(Stay May 5th \u2013May 11th 2006)Overview----The Hilton Waikoloa village is a beautiful recently renovated massive resort with carefully manicured grounds featuring a large assortment of plants and animals. While it also boasts friendly service and great tasting food if can be a drag in the areas of transportation, parking, and staff friendliness.The Resort & Grounds----Massive and Beautiful are the first two words that come to mind. The resort consists of several buildings/towers spread out in a straight line. Each of the buildings are connected by a large walkway which follows along the tram tracks. The path is covered, yet open aired and littered with artwork. The walk along the path is enjoyable and beautiful as it looks out across the gardens, pools, restaurants, etc and into the distant ocean. A walk from one side of the resort to the other typically takes 15 minutes. (+- 5 minutes depending on how fast you can walk!)Pools----The resort had several pools to choose from but only one of the pools was the size I would expect at a resort of this magnitude. This pool was all the way at the end of the resort near the Lagoon Tower. It was this pool that the slide and scenic waterfall dumped into. This pool stretched from the waterslide to under the waterfall to around the hot tubs to around the bar and ended near one of the breakfast/lunch pavilions. The rest of the pools at the resort were small and not as scenic. A couple of them were attached by *very* small water slides designed for kids. The \u2018Adult\u2019 pool is located on the opposite side of the resort next to the Ocean tower. This pool was larger than the dinky pools, but paled in comparison to the large one at the Lagoon Tower. It was comparable to the kind of indoor pool you might find at one of your chain hotels back home. I found nothing about the \u2018Adult\u2019 pool exciting or worthwhile, though it was slightly quieter than the larger pool. Overall, it tended to be where the older overweight adults would congregate and hide from the rest of the public. ----Onto a very important topic\u2026 pool temperature. None of the pools are heated, we confirmed this with the resort staff (thought you certainly don\u2019t need confirmation!). The first 4 days we arrived, the island was facing some unpleasant weather. It rained on and off during the day and the sky was mostly overcast. Cold rain + no sun = VERY COLD pool water. In addition to that, water features like the huge water fall and water slide only work to quickly cool off water by allowing the air more exposure to the water. It was freezing!! Once in, you got slightly used to it as long as you keep moving around and as long as the sun was peaking out. As soon as the sun went away you started to shiver. Obviously if rain had not come, and the sun had been out the water would have been slightly warmer\u2026 but I doubt it would have been much warmer given the size of the pool and the water-cooling features. For the price of this place, I would have expected them to spring for a few pool heaters.----Which reminds me of another thing\u2026 Hot Tubs\u2026 The hotel had 3 or 4. And you might expect to find them scattered around the resort. At the very least you would expect one next to the \u2018Adult\u2019 pool. Not so on both accounts!! All 3 or 4 hot tubs are located around the main pool. Two of the three I remember have a small water fall splashing into the water. It\u2019s pretty looking, but --- annoying. And the 3rd does not have splashing water to annoy you BUT it\u2019s located in the grotto inside the main pool. This means you have to swim through the FREEZING cold pool water to get IN and OUT of the hot tub. What idiot thought that up?----There is also a huge lagoon with a small sandy beach area located in the middle of the hotel. The water was what I would expect from a natural ocean-fed lagoon, it wasn\u2019t crystal clear, but it wasn\u2019t murky either\u2026 it was somewhere in between. We did not snorkel in the lagoon, but we did see a handful of people each day out there. Standing outside the lagoon you could see down fairly well, and the entire time I only saw one small fish go by. Perhaps there was more in the middle, but having been to two other fantastic snorkeling spot on the island this seems to lack anything exciting. However, the calm water would make it a perfect place for beginners to practice snorkeling.Room----Beautiful, spacious, clean! What more can I say? The bed was VERY comfortable more so than the \u201cAdvertised Soft\u201d beds at the Hyatt on Maui. The d\u00e9cor was pleasing and the furniture in good condition. Each room had a mini fridge, mini bar, safe, and decent sized flat SCREEN tv. There was PLENTY of room to unpack and store clothing with a long dresser providing 4 larger drawers, two nightstands, a desk, and a tall cabinet-like piece that held the mini bar on the bottom. In addition was an open (no door) closet with plenty of room. The bathroom was clean and everything was in working order. Food/Restaurants----Ok. This place boasts some 10 restaurants. But let\u2019s debunk that myth! 3 of them are \u2018snack bars\u2019 which are equivalent to the nacho-hut you would find at a Six Flags theme park, both in size and in food quality. (Down to 7). Another is the Luau. What the hell, a Luau is NOT a restaurant! Ok. So of the 6 remaining here is what you have. 1 is Breakfast and Lunch only. 2 are Asian based cuisines. 1 is upscale Steak. 1 is upscale Itallian. And the last one is a Breakfast/Dinner buffet. That leave you with 5 dinner selections\u2026 or does it? The Breakfast/Dinner buffet was closed 80% of the time we were there. You see, the hotel wasn\u2019t filled at capacity, and according to their bartenders they close the buffets and cheaper restaurants first. How nice of the Hilton to close the \u2018more affordable\u2019 restaurants and leave me paying for $40 for a steak served a la carte ($12 salad, etc). I\u2019m also a meat and potato guy, and don\u2019t enjoy most Asian food\u2026 which left me with only 2 dinners to choose from every night! The kings shop (a couple of miles from hotel) has a couple of places to eat, but it gets to be a hassle to leave the hotel just for a meal (Wait for tram, ride tram, get car, drive car.. etc). We also spent more of our days out driving the island and just wanted to relax a bit. A few days we drove back out to Hilo for dinner (half hour ride each way). ----In fairness, the food at the Hilton was very good, but not excellent. The restaurant staff in general was mediocre to poor. %20 on a $200+ bill is $40 or more in tip!! For that kind of money I at least expected to get the same service I get from back home at the Olive Garden or TGI Fridays. The staff varied in all aspects. Some where rude, but attentive, others were very friendly but only saw you once and left drinks unfilled. In one particular instance at the \u2018Kamuela Provision Company\u2019 a busboy spilled two full glasses of water on our table while trying to close the window next to our table. The water soaked the table, the floor, splashed me, splashed my wife, and splashed our digital camera. (Accidents happen) The busboy scrambled to clean the mess and apologized while the waitress and management watched from across the room. They didn\u2019t offer to help and they didn\u2019t offer to make sure we or our camera was OK. We stood, holding our drinks/plates for 5 minutes while only the busboy worked to setup a new table and clean the floor. Nothing was offered us, not even a free desert.Parking Lot----The hotel offers both valet and free parking. Free parking of course being the furthest parking lot and an absolute joke. The free parking here is TERRIBLE. The lot is almost always full and you have to circle around several times to find someone leaving. During the day it\u2019s easier to find a spot since most people are away. But at night, around dinner time, it\u2019s a nightmare. Some people parked on curbs, others parked in the taxi-only parking (none of which received any tickets). Everyone else had to valet. And remember, we were here when the hotel *wasn\u2019t* full.Staff----Restaurant staff is covered in the Restaurant section above. The rest of the staff was wonderful and friendly\u2026 right down to the staff that empties the garbage cans along the pathways. We were always greeted with a smile and an \u2018Aloha\u2019 as we walked by them. The front desk staff was also friendly, but relatively useless. Other than entering in our data into their system they didn\u2019t provide us with much other than a paper map and a \u2018Your room is that way\u2019. They didn\u2019t explain anything (trams, boats, direction, restaurants, parking, fees, etc) and didn\u2019t offer us help with our luggage. The cleaning staff was fantastic, and the room was always spotless. We (my wife) brought a lot of shoes, and most of the days the staff would line them up under the bathroom sink (Nice Touch!). Miscellaneous----As mentioned on other reviews and in my own experience this hotel is the host of many LARGE conferences. I wont get into details, but you can expect a large amount of people to be dressed in suits talking on their cell phones. It kind of puts a damper on the thought of \u2018getting away from it all\u2019. It\u2019s also strange to be sitting in a tram in your swimming trunks while everyone else is dressed in a suit. It didn\u2019t happen often, but the few times it does is just weird.----Culture: This is slightly off topic, but interesting to know if you are comparing islands. Compared to Maui, the Big Island is comprised of a lot more Hawaiians and Asians\u2026 both in staff at the hotel and people you encounter on the island. It was a refreshing look into Hawaii\u2019s culture. For whatever reason, a larger percentage of hotel guests were also Asian. Whereas Maui is 80% staffed by Californians and the visitors tend to be American. The Big Island felt more authentic, but wasn\u2019t as much fun (as in beach party) as Maui.Conclusion----Wow! Overall a great experience and a great hotel. The most important thing is that I\u2019d be willing to go back. That said, I can also see how this hotel receives mixed reviews. Your experience is comprised of 2 things. 1) Your location in this Mega Resort. 2) How you plan to spend your time here.----The Ocean Tower was very nice and quiet with nice rooms and decent views. But knowing what I know now I would have much rather stayed in the Lagoon tower to help minimize the walk to the hot tubs and the large pool. Staying in the Lagoon tower would have also allowed for a much quicker exit to the parking lot and avoided some of the conference crowd. ----While at dinner you too might run into some below average waiting staff, but it\u2019s certainly not terrible and certainly not all of the waiters/waitresses. ----If you plan to be on the go and have places to drive to early in the morning the size of the resort will start to weigh you down. But never was it so bad that I would have chosen another hotel\u2026 though I would have chosen the Lagoon Tower instead of Ocean.----The good and bad aside, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed in your stay at this hotel. Despite the few negative items above, I am still rating this hotel as 5 stars based on the overall pleasurable experience. ", " What a nice reward for Gold or Diamond Honors members. My family and I made our second trip to the big island and stayed at the Hilton this time. We were not disappointed. After a year of hard work, the six nights in the ocean tower were the just what I needed. We had an ocean view room that also had a view of two volcanoes. The beds were very comfortable. The breakfast on the executive level every morning was very satisfying as were the afternoon snacks and evening cocktails. The staff made us feel at home and the concierge answered all of our sightseeing questions. The spa is top notch and very relaxing. The dining at the resort is spendy but you have the option of heading into Kona to take advantage of all of the restaurants there. And there are plenty to choose from. This is a family friendly facility and if you are looking for peace and quiet you need to keep looking. My family and I definitely will be back! ", " I found a $150/night rate and stayed for a week. What a unique place, little slice of heaven. On-site restaurants (there are many) are excellent but pricey. Drive into Kona for lots more dining options, including great sushi. ", " We have traveled to many tropical resorts and the Hilton Waikoloa is the best. You have so much to choose from pools, lagoons, restaurants, shopping and golf. We highly recommend all the restaurants on site but also at the Kings shops (especially Kirin). The pools are not heated, but we thought that was a plus (refreshing). The lagoon was not cloudy and we saw many tropical fish and sea turtles. The kids loved the water slides and the sandy bottom kids pool was perfect for our 2 year old. The staff were very friendly and helpful with any request. The golf was great, the beach course is a good warm-up , the kings course and next door at Mauna Lani South were great courses. We have been to other resorts (Grand Wailea, Atlantis, etc.) but the Hilton was just so much more relaxing. We stayed in the Ocean tower and never had a problem with the birds in the morning. The Palm Terrace is also a great place for breakfast. Of course, it is pricey but you are in Hawaii and everything is expensive. I can't believe anyone would complain about how long it takes to get from one side of the resort to the other, the grounds are incredible and never had to wait longer than 5 min. to catch either the tram or boat. We can't wait to go back. ", " HWV - Hilton Waikoloa Village, Big Island HawaiiPRO'S :I am a Hilton Diamond Member and was upgrade to a renovated two room suite in the Ocean tower so that my kids had their own room with two Rollaway beds. My family of 4 was very comfortable. The renovated rooms have Big Plasma screen TV's in each roomThe Ocean Tower executive lounge is on the sixth floor and had good coffee / fruit / pastries / bagels and toast in the morning. From 12 to 4PM the lounge had soda / coffee and cookies. From 5 to 7PM the lounge had cheese / veggies / and two hot small finger food type items. The lounge use wasgreat considering we used 4 to 6 bottles of water / soda per day and at the gift shop they would have run you $3 to $5 per bottle.The Lagoon was very clean and clear and we all had a great time using it. My kids rented the paddle boats and paddle bikes and actually swamright next to the turtles in a very nice environmentThe pools were cool, not cold. The air temp was approximately 80 to 85 degrees each day by late morning the pools were very refreshing not ice cold.The restaurants were expensive but very good. The Italian restaurant ( Donatani's ) and the Provision company restaurant were excellent. Dinner for a family of 4 ( two kids under 12 ) ran approximately $170 to $200 with a round of drinks. Everything in Hawaii is expensive. Breakfast at the Palm Terrace was also very good ( $ 27.00 per person ).We were at the property for 8 days and the Trams and / or Boats were always waiting for us. We never had more than a 2 or 3 minute wait. I think since the Ocean tower is the last stop and we spent most of our time at the Lagoon and Kohala pool ( the opposite end of the property ) also the last stop had something to do with their almost always being either a tram or boat waiting for us. The few times we decided to walk it was a very nice walk with great artwork and nice scenery. The walk only took about 7 minutes from the lagoon to the ocean tower with two kids and \" stuff \" in tow.,The employee's at the property were very helpful and very nice. I did not have one single negative issue or encounter the entire time we were on property. The property is a great Hilton property my family had a tremendous time !CON :ALAMO CAR RENTALI know Alamo is always cheaper but you get what you pay for ! The service picking the car up and then again dropping the car off was HORRENDOUS !. At 10:00PM at night with 2 full flight landing only two people working at the counter and a line of 15 customers. Nobody behind the counter had any sense of urgency ( the car rental almost took as long as the flight from NJ ). 1 hour and 15 minutes in line to get a car rental after 18 hours of traveling.Dropping the car off was the same. 8 cars lined up to check back into Alamo with one guy hold a handheld computer. It took him 25 minutes to get to me and then the shuttle from the counter to the terminal took another 20 minutes to come. In the time it took the Alamoshuttle to come back to the rental counter to take people to the terminal the national shuttle passed twice / the Avis shuttle passed twice and the hertz shuttle passed 3 times.I will never rent from Alamo again ! ", " With its meticulously coiffed grounds, futuristic tram, canal boats, garden sculpture, extensive shopping, and man-made pools and lakes, this place reminded us a lot of Disneyland. I would bet that it's about the same size. We loved our stay at this Hilton and wished we could have stayed longer than three days. There's so much to do and see all within this one hotel complex.If you love art, you must see the collection at this hotel. We spent a good deal of time enjoying, reading about, and photographing the art exhibits, which would easily fill a small museum. My wife used the spa and really enjoyed the hot rocks massage. We ate breakfast a couple of times at the Orchid Cafe poolside and can recommend it (except for the birds constantly flying about). I forgot my tennis racquet, but the tennis facilities are impressive. We don't golf, but they certainly offer that as well. If you enjoy fun on the water, I can't think of a better place to be. I've never seen so many pools, waterfalls, lagoons, jacuzzis -- not to mention the huge koi pond.Another thing we liked was that the hotel is within walking distance of the King's Shops. We needed to visit the general store there a couple of times and had a terrific dinner at Roy's.Downsides? A stay at the Hilton Waikoloa isn't cheap. Food, in particular, is pricey. We found all of the hotel personnel to be friendly and helpful, and our room was exceptional in every way -- but there was some obvious mold around the bathtub. There was construction going on in the Lagoon Tower while we were there. It didn't bother us, but it was definitely a big eyesore every time we walked through the atrium. The hostess at the Chinese restaurant wouldn't give us a table in the main dining area because she said all of those tables were reserved. An hour later, when we left, the main dining area was still mostly empty. Very annoying!However, in general, we loved our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa and are already talking about going back next year. ", " This is an excellent resort for the family vacation to Hawaii. We spent 7 glorious nights at this mega hotel complex. If you like solitude and a romantic getaway for 2, this may not be your place. It is large, spread out, and filled with stuff to do. There are many kids here. We never tired of the pools, lagoon with turtles that swim right by you, and excellent restaurants. The rooms are spacious with lots of drawer space and a walk in closet. We will definitely return. ", " I think the reviews make more sense if you know a little about the people who made the trip. I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village from April 7th to April 14th with my wife (35) and two kids (4 and 6). This resort is paradise for families but not the best option for what I like to call Newlyweds and Nearly-Deads (honeymooners and older folks). This resort feels like something Walt Disney and Steve Wynn collaborated on to make the perfect resort in Hawaii. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and well cared for. Every step along the 65 acres site lets you know that you are in paradise and this resort is something special. The walking paths, art hallways, bridges, and boat/tram rides just highlighted our trip and were not a deterrent of a perfect vacation like some people wrote. (I\u2019m going to include pictures to make that point!)The rooms were very spacious. We had two double beds for the family and had more than enough room to be comfortable and enjoy the beautiful balcony as well. We had a garden view in the Ocean Tower and could not have been happier. The garden area in front of the pool was beautiful and we could see part of the ocean. I saw the ocean view room and I don\u2019t think it was worth the upgrade. The garden view room was very nice. The beds were very comfortable, but we were a little hot sleeping with just the heavy duvet so we requested a set of sheets to pull over us and they were brought right up. There is a concierge at the base of every tower and they were very responsive. We also asked for a mini-fridge and they supplied that free of charge and had that in the room within minutes!As I\u2019m sure you will read in many other reviews, the food is very expensive. I dismissed those knowing that all resort food usually is, but I was shocked with some of the prices. You just have to be smart about it. We used our mini-fridge to store breakfast food, so we ate on the balcony in the mornings. There is a Food Land grocery store in Waimea 25 minutes to the north or a Wallmart in Kona 20 minutes to the south. There is also a small store in the town of Waikoloa but people said that was really expensive. We ate lunches at the Lagoon and the prices were a little high, but the food was really good. I recommend the Mahi Sandwich and the Turkey Wrap. Bring snakes and water with you in a backpack\u2026life saver with the kids. For dinner go out if you want better food for a little cheaper. We loved Kona Brewing Company in Kona, Roys at Kings Shops 3 minutes from the resort (make reservations and make sure to order the chocolate molten lave cake for desert), and there is a great new Italian restaurant in Waimea called Solimene's that is inexpensive and very authentic, great portions and delicious. We did eat at Imari Japanese restaurant in the resort and Palm Terrace. The food is a little above average, but again you pay the price at the resort. The dink prices did make me laugh or should I say cry. My wife ordered a mimosa that cost $13.54 (the cents killed me) and I had a Kona Red Ale that was $7.02 (again, why not just $7.00 \uf04a ) Lava Flows were $10.00 but worth every penny to have at least one at the pool on a warm day. So if you want to drink a little more I saw people with ice chests.The lagoon pool and the Kona pool were perfect. The kids loved making sand castles at the lagoon and we rented a Kayak and paddle boats (15 bucks for a half hour seemed fine) to explore the turtles, eels and jumping fish from this fresh ocean water wonder. The Kona pool is better than something you would see at the finest Vegas resort. It had waterfall, awesome slide, hot tubs in the caves, plenty of chairs, a rickety old bridge that crosses the pool, and a perfect sand pool attached for the little kids.I like to jog on vacation and the front desk gave me a map of a few walk/jog routes around Waikoloa Beach Resort. I chose a perfect 3.5 mile route that takes you through the beautiful plush grounds and past the golf courses. There were many walkers and joggers out in the morning. It is a little breezy in Waikoloa, but very comfortable overall.I would definitely go back to this resort in the future (although I loved Maui more than the Big Island). Feel free to ask me any questions, as I am now a big fan and wouldn\u2019t mind pimping this resort to anyone interested! ", " Just returned from 7 nights stay with wife and 2 young kids from March 20 \u2013 March 27 and overall just loved this place!Major points to consider:1) Overall size: Yes this resort is huge with 1200 rooms in 3 towers. The property is spread out over 60 acres so we never felt like it was overcrowded. We never waited unreasonably for any service (check-in, getting towels, ordering drinks, being seated in any of the restaurants, etc.). The landscaping of the grounds are worth seeing even if you\u2019re not staying there, and many of the plants, flowers and trees are marked with placards that give its name and description. The trams and boats were never that slow in coming and the walk from one end to another was only about 10-12 minutes through a gorgeously decorated walkway. We ended most our days with a walk along the perimeter of the property by the ocean, laying in the hammocks or cabanas dotted across the grounds and just enjoying the ocean view and breeze. Its size was a plus for us, and I can\u2019t imagine why someone would stay there knowing its size and then complain about it being too big. 2) Service: This is a Hilton, not the Four Seasons, so I would agree with some of the previous reviewers that this is not white glove service. If being pampered and waited on hand-and-foot is important, don\u2019t stay at a Hilton. We found the service above average and I cannot recall even once being frustrated by any lack of service or wait time. My contact with the employees was nothing but positive, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a hit-and-miss situation.3) Room: We stayed in the Ocean Tower on the Executive floor and were upgraded to a Suite at check-in due to my Diamond status. (Tip for Honors members: Don\u2019t be afraid to ask \u201cDo you have a suite available?\u201d The desk clerk had to get manager approval for this request but I don\u2019t think we would have received a suite unless I had asked.) Room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The Exec lounge was great for continental breakfasts and we\u2019d go by in the afternoons for cookies and take a few cans of soda to-go to stock the refrigerator in the room. 4) Pools: Pools are all over the place with the best ones close to the Lagoon Tower. Plenty of room for everyone although the most popular spots for chairs will fill up early in the day. It would be nice if the pools were heated but I consider that a minor complaint. Our favorite spot was the lagoon \u2013 a man made beach with sand on an ocean fed 4 acre salt water lagoon. We rented kayaks and snorkeling gear and the water was warmer than the pools. We really enjoyed the fish and sea turtles in the lagoon. Although we had a car all week, we were happy enough with the Lagoon that we never actually make it to Hapuna Beach down the road. 5) Dolphins: Although we did not participate in the Dolphin program offered, I was quite impressed that the dolphins were not hid away where only program participants could see them. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the dolphins swim, jump and play from just a few feet away without having to pay the fees. As big a money maker as this must be for Hilton, they could easily have built walls around the area to restrict viewing. 6) Spa: Being Diamond members we could use the workout facilities and locker room for free. We used both the cardio and weight room and both were pretty good. Locker room was superb with great steam room, sauna and hot tub, keyed lockers, flip-flops, and a nice lounge with fruit and ice water and tea. We were able to use the locker rooms on our day of departure at the end of the day to clean up prior to our late evening flight from Kona.7) Restaurants: We did not do any of the fine dining offered but did eat at the Palm Terrace for dinner and got lunch at the Lagoon Grill and Boat Landing Pavilion. Food is expensive but we were satisfied with the quality and quantity and were able to satisfy our 10 year old\u2019s limited tastes.8) American Express Travel office: Located just off the lobby area, we used this to book two excursions and found them very friendly and helpful. We took a snorkeling trip and a tour around the island and since we charged both tours to the room got lots of Hilton Honors points to boot!9) Parking: Used the free self park instead of valet. Spots were harder to find after about 8pm but we always found one. Parking lot is only a 3 to 4 minute walk to the lobby.In summary, this is large resort with many activities to keep entertained that is ideal for families. It\u2019s not cheap, intimate, or the Four Seasons.  During the week, I pointed out to my wife several of the complaints from previous reviews (dirty lagoon, unkept grounds, nasty service) and she just looked at me like I was an alien. It became a running joke between us during the trip (\u201clet\u2019s go hang out at that disgusting lagoon beach\u201d) Overall, we loved this resort and we\u2019re already planning next year\u2019s trip! ", " OK, so it would be hard to have an ugly hotel in paradise, but this place is gorgeous. When we checked in they had on record that we wanted a fridge and crib put in the room. When we got to the room, there they were! HOw often does that happen? And they gave us our request for 2 queen beds. As a bonus, the upgraded us to a partial ocean view free of charge!There are hundreds of artifacts, paintings and ceremonial and tribal art all along the walk to your room, which is a good 5-15 minute walk, depending on where your room is. There is a tram or boat that can take you to your room as well. The grounds are beautiful. The staff is friendly and quietly goes about ther business. The pools are beautiful! There's a cave and waterfall in one! Perfect for kids. There is also an adults only pool.The food was delicious, yet expensive. You get what you pay for here though! At night, it's a magical place. With the trade winds blowing, tiki torches lit and the waves crashing in the background, you feel like you never want to leave! If you decide to stay here, there's 2 things you must do...watch a sunset at Buddha Point over by the Ocean tower rooms and bring plenty of cash! ", " This is no resort it is PARADISE! If you are looking for beautiful surroundings and excellent amenities then this is the place to stay! We LOVED IT! ", " I stayed at the Hilton from March 10-16 and loved every minute of it! The pools are wonderful - there's even an adult's only pool if you crave a bit of piece and quiet - and the lagoon is great for snorkeling - there are even a few turtles that will come and check you out! Don't miss Dolphin Quest - the staff is knowledgable and friendly and the dolphins are absolutly unreal. Even if you only sit on the side, it is so much fun to watch.The room was amazing - plenty of room for two people. I stayed in Ocean Tower and loved it. The housekeeping and turn down services were supurb - I never had such amazing service. Room service is overpriced (where isn't it?) but quick and good food. The restaurants on site are quite nice. If you're a fan of Japanese food, I highly suggest visiting Imari's and sitting at the sushi bar (reservations are wise if you don't care to wait.) Fumiyo, the head chef, is charming and quite talented. I enjoyed my first dinner there so much I returned two nights later.The tram is slow, but you're in HAWAII - life moves slower. Don't be in a rush for anything (and why should you be? you're on vacation!) It is quite a large resort and there is a walk between buildings, but it is a B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L walk.The activities desk is very helpful if you're looking for things to do. There is no resort shuttle, but rentals are plentiful and taxi drivers are eager. I would return in half a second. Please email me if you have any questions. ", " We travelled from Australia and I must admit I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy my stay here because of the reviews I had read on this site. Perhaps Australians don't have as high expectations as Americans but this place was unbelievable. Yes there is a distance to walk or a wait for a monorail or a boat - but that is what you get in a resort - lots of space so you aren't sitting on top of other guests. If you want to stay in a hotel you won't have to worry about these things. The monorail, boat or walking options were all really enjoyable and the landscape is spectacular. The rooms were large and comfortable and the staff very friendly. The walk to the lobby from the self park area was around 100m and it was always easy to get a spot. People complain about cost of things - if you ate out at a similar place in Australia you would be paying the same sort of prices. We had a wonderful stay and would come back anytime. I booked via the Hilton website, got a great deal and a wonderful room. If you want a relaxing holiday this is the place to come and unwind. ", " My friend and I just returned from a 7 day vacation to this wonderful hotel. So we were 2 young single overworked New York City girls looking for rest and relaxation, and we absolutely found it here! The big island isn't developed, and you will arrive in a airport to a dessert of lava rock and brush, but don't worry this is the oasis in the dessert. The hotel was immaculately designed and landscaped, the pictures on the website don't even begin to describe its splendor.The resort is spacious so it is a little trek to the various pools and amenities but not more than the equivalent of 2 city blocks at most. You can take the tram, boat or walk it, but seriously what is the rush you are on vacation. We are from NYC so we did not find the prices of the food to be expensive, however if your are not accustomed to such prices you may want to purchase lunch and dinner at the Kings Shops much cheaper or take a trip to the supermarket and utilize the rooms fridge. If you bring your children here be prepared to shell out money for meals because costs can add up. The hotel is a bit isolated, but there isn't much going on the big island anyway, the touristry bars and restaurants are in Kona, but there wasn't much happening there either. The entertainment in the Mololo lounge was mediocre at best, but again this is the place to relax and enjoy some fun recreation it is not the place to come to party, if it is a party you want try the hotel clubs in Honolulu or come to NYC, LA or Miami. Be prepared since there are hardly any singles at the hotel, mostly couples and families. This is a family resort but because it is so spread out with so many pools, you don't hardly see or feel the presence of the children, so no need to worry about them.The wildlife and flora and fauna were incorporated wonderfully. Yes the birds are very loud, they are in the trees near everyone of the hotels so their is no way to avoid them. They start up around 6 in the evening and go to sleep at around 10, so if you come in after then you won't hear them, and they wake at about 6am so be prepared for the wake-up calls.You will have a wonderful time here, just be sure and bring extra money, and enjoy the paradise. ", " Last year, my husband and I needed a great, relaxing vacation, and wanted to stay in the USA. Opting for sun and heat in winter, Hawaii was the place. We have both seen much of other Hawaiian Islands, but wanted to some exploring on the Big Island this time. We made the right choice! I had stayed at the Hilton Waikaloa some years back with some girlfriends (it was a Hyatt at the time) and recalled it being wonderful at the time, so I suggested we try it again this time. I'm glad we did. I read many of the reviews suggesting it is now \"Disney Land\", but I went on my memory of something different, and I was right. So, even if you are a big city, urban, professional couple like us, who desire a little peace and solitude, away from kids, you won't have much trouble finding it at this resort. Fortunately, it's very large, so there are many areas to get away from the crowds. One of our favorite spots to be away from it all was on the grassy ocean point of the resort, which happens to also be one of the most beautiful spots on the grounds. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant (Denatos?),but thought the Provision Co. to be just so-so for rediculous prices. Our room in the Ocean Tower was very nice (that's saying a lot as I travel for work in 5 star hotels constantly!). We are hoping to go back next year after our next trip to the S of France. ", " My husband and I just got home after staying 7 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa. We picked it specifically becasue of 6 free Hilton night certificates that were going to expire soon. I wanted to use them at a place where they would be worth something, and we weren't disappointed. My husband is a Diamond member, and we were given an oceanfront room in the Ocean Tower. The view from the balcony was outstanding. The whales were extremely active last week and could be watched from our room. It was a great bonus to have the Executive Lounge for breakfast each morning. The variety and quality of fruit was excellent, and there were many varieties of boxed cereals, along with juices and bagels and pastries. The lounge also had cookies and soft drinks from 12:00 to 4:00, and appetizers from 5:00 to 7:00. The hot appetizers weren't anything to write home about, but there were a lot of vegetables and dip along with with cheese and crackers. Yes, it a huge property but it never seemed crowded at all even though it was sold out most of the time. You just have to be prepared to walk for a while or wait for the train or boat to get you around. We would definitely recommend this property. ", " Let me preface by saying this stay was part of our honeymoon (6 nights in Hawaii at Hilton Waikoloa and 6 nights in Oahu at Hilton Hawaiian Village). We are avid travelers, only stay at top luxury resorts and enjoy fine dining. We are very picky about hotels. We chose Hilton b/c I am a Hilton Gold VIP, we used points and the Hiltons in Hawaii are independantly owned and have the reputation for being some the best resorts to stay at in Hawaii-if not the best for an OVERALL resort.Here are the facts about Waikoloa:1. Property is built on lava field on the Kohala side of island, meaning barren land around the hotel, very sunny and dry weather. Outside of the hotel looks like desert-solid 25 minute drive to airport and Kona, 5-10 minute drive to other resorts (which I suggest trying for different brunch buffets). All the lush vegetation around the hotel is landscaped. The resort is very tropical and absolutely breathtaking--from gardens, ponds, waterfalls, artwork, and the gorgeous lagoon and lava rock lined beach.2. No sand beach here, manmade sand lagoon though and great \"A\" bay is walking distance. secluded adult pools near ocean tower along with a super pool with hotubs, waterfalls, dolphins, snorkeling and grotos by lagoon tower.3. palace tower is most luxurious, views are of mountains or distant ocean--VERY quiet tower for couples. NOT recommended for kids or those who want ocean view. we stayed here. easy 10 minute walk to lobby. very close to adult swim pools.4. ocean tower large and farthest from lobby (still only 12-15 minute walk). decent ocean views, but i dont like the layout of this tower and it is the most standard in terms of amenities.5. lagon tower can have some great views, very close to central activity and lobby. downside would be privacy. kids should stay here.6. trams and boats are cool, nice to have trams for heavy luggage when checking in/out and boats are romantic at night or to go around the resort during day to get acclimated. they are for ambiance, not transportation really...you can walk faster. know this going in.7. Unlike Hilton-Oahu, meals, drinks and restaraunts were dissapointing here. The provision company is a good sunset dinner which i recommend the beef osso bucca, otherwise eat elsewhere!!! pass on donatonis--worst fine dining meal ever and horrid service. beers are canned poolside (no corona bottles), so skip them. tropical drinks are plain bad and pricey. go to costco in kona, get soft cooler and your own beer and use hilton's quick filling ice machines and you are set :-)8. more secluded luxury resort feel here around beach and pools, nice and quiet.9. staff friendly, not overwhelmingly helpful but friendly and no problems. 10. housekeeping great, beds THE BEST. large rooms, flat screen TVs.11. other idiots are exagerating the walk time between towers and to parking lot. this place is an average sized large resort...just more spread out. anyone who says different has obviously never stayed at a hotel resort with more than one tower. you want days inn go elsewhere, you want paradise, stay here.tips:big island rocks, so much to see...volcano helicopter tour (sunshine helicopters), waipo valley, hawaiian tropical botanical gardens, go to beach at A bay, up the road to Mau Kea hotel for breakfast buffet, cafe pesto for italian. the show at the marriot next door is the luau to go to. skip hapuna beach and south side of island unless you have time--overated! hilo 2 hours away. rent 4x4, not a convertible! costco in kona. get kona coffee near airport and ship it home.4 1/2 stars out of 5. see my 5 star review of the hilton oahu soon ", " We stayed at the Hilton for the first week of our honeymoon Nov. 21-26, 2005. We had a golf view room in the Ocean tower. This tower is the furthest from the lobby, but we found it easier to walk there instead of waiting for a boat or train. It was about an 8 minute walk from the tower. The bed was one of the most comfy I've slept in. We had the buffet breakfast included with our stay and it was always good. We ate at Kiran Chinese Restaurant, which was pretty good, standard Chinese and Donatino's on Thanksgivings which was excellent! I definitely recommend eating here, great Italian! There are several pools to chose from, as well as a small, adult only pool, and there was always one that wasn't very crowded. This is a great hotel to stay at and I would stay here again. A great value. ", " My husband and I stayed at the hotel five years ago and loved it just as much this time around. We stayed from January 14-January 20. My husband is a diamond member and we stayed on points. We did not recieve an upgrade because there was a big convention staying at the resort, but that worked out well, because the restuarants and pools were not crowded because the convention people were occupied. We still had a beautiful room in the Ocean tower, which we loved, on the 7th floor and had access to the executive level, which was very nice, especially for breakfast. I had read the beds were extremely comforted, and the reviews were correct!!! Everyone was very nice and accomodating. We had a couple of mistakes on our bill and they did not hesitate to take it off, no questions asked! We ate at Donatoni's, Kamuela Provision Company, The Boat Landing, the Lagoon Grill, and the place by the big pool. All the restaurants were good. We enjoyed all our meals and had no complaints about the service or the food. Yes, it is expensive, but that is what you expect. You are at a great resort. You get what you pay for. We did not see a run down resort as we have read in other reviews. It was as beautiful and relaxing as ever. We are already wanting to plan our next visit. We believe it is all in your attitude. We watched the sunset three days, and it was gorgeous!!!! We walked across from Budda point to the golf course to watch it. It was less crowded. We also walked down the stairs by the Provision Company and hiked on the trail. We loved every minute of our vacation and hope to go back soon. Have an excellent time. Don't be in a rush, relax, and enjoy the beauty that surrounds you; it is every where! Oh, go to Kona shopping on the main drag and send a coconut to friends and family. There is a shop owned by a very nice lady who sells them for 12.95. You can decorate it and everything. People love it! Her shop is located in the main shopping area, where there are lots of shops, on the same side as the ocean. I am sorry I don't know the name of the shop, but she has a sign outside of the store advertising the coconuts! :) Have fun!!!!! ", " We stayed here for 5 nights in January and had a wonderful room in the Lagoon Tower. For us -- two adults this was the best tower to be in...we were close to all the action and what we believe was the best pool! Yes, the resort is big but for us that was no problem at all! If you want to be near the lobby and near a GREAT pool, then the Lagoon tower is the one for you! Keep in mind, this hotel does not have beach access...just lagoon access...so just remember if you are looking for beach -this is not the place! Previous reviews suggest that the boats and monorails take too long but we never found that to be a problem...yes, we had to wait a few minutes every now and then but to me that was never a problem I would gripe about! There is no other hotel in Hawaii like this place...I feel sure of that! I loved riding the boats...I thought they were so neat! As far as dining at the resort, we dined our first evening at Donatoni's and we found the food to be excellent! I loved the pasta dish I had and my husband had the filet...service on the other hand was not what we expected...our server was over-worked and definitely not too friendly! Oh, well though--we had a beautiful table outside and we could watch the boats go by...it was so neat! When it started to drizzle towards the end of our meal, they moved us inside with no problem. (side note on that: if you can, eat outside...the ambiance is much better.!) So other than a grumpy server who was probably just having a bad night--we loved our EXPENSIVE meal there! IT WAS WORTH IT! On our last night, we ate at the Provision Company and what a highlight that was...we had 7 PM reservations but called cause we were ready earlier than expected and also hungry--and they had an outside table for us at 5 PM so we were able to watch the sunset. This was a total fluke as I really did not read much about this restaurant before we booked it...but WOW...it was great! THE VIEW WAS AWESOME! We had a really nice server who took our picture and of course I am sure the $56 bottle of wine we splurged on helped our mood and good memory of the place! The food was EXCELLENT! IT WAS WORTH IT! What else can I add??? Yes, drinks at the Hilton are expensive but they are expensive everywhere in Hawaii...be smart....if you know you want to drink stop at the K-mart before you get to the Hilton and stock up. It's right near the airport. We did the Dolphin Quest program and the time with the dolphins is indeed short but for us it was fun....Even if you don't participate in the program, just watching the dolphins is very neat. We made the drive to Kona on two occasions...one to eat at Bubba Gump's (so-so) and the other to rent snorkel gear at Snorkel Bob's -- it was about 1/2 from the Hilton. (easy drive....not hard to find)One other thing I will add...we did go to the King's shop's - Hilton runs a shuttle that you pay $1 each way for...not sure why they charge a fee for this service but hey it's $1 and no one has to drive. We ate at Roy's one night and the Merryman's Cafe...I would recommend Roy's. Merryman's Cafe to us was so-so...but I read other reviews here that gave it thumbs up so I guess it just depends! This review has been long but I hope it has been helpful! We loved the Hilton and hopefully one day, we will be back! ", " First of all I must say that this is Hawaii & some other reviewers need to take a chill pill. Things are laid back there & you may need to wait for a tram or boat but heck your on vacation, what's your rush? We however were treated like Royal Guest. I am Diamond VIP & were upgrated to a suite even during Christmas. Stayed in the Ocean Tower. Great because close to Executive Lounge for breakfast. Meals there are pricy but planned on it. Dinner at Provision Co for sunset is a must. They even have S'mores for dessert. Donotoni's very good also. We are 2 adults in our 40's & loved the Dolphin Quest. Another big tip: we did the dinner cruise through Red Sail Sports located there on grounds so they shuttle you to where you need to go. Qutstanding. Few people, lots of food & open bar. Plus lots of whales so we cancled the whale watch planned. We were there at peak season and never felt crowded. You will love this place.Also did Sub Tour, Volcano, South Point, & Black Sand Beach. The best place I have ever stayed. Am happy to answer any questions. Aloha pcarver@yahoo.com ", " Incredible. My Partner and I, and my Partners 7 year old son stayed here in Feb 2005.This was our first trip to Hawaii. We stayed for a few days in Honolulu, did some great shopping and had some great food. But really it was like a big version of Australia's Surfers Paradise. We then flew to the Big Island for 2 weeks. We hired a Jeep at Kona Airport and drove the 20 minutes to the Hilton. Wow! We were so impressed when we got there. Its huge!We had excellent service from the time we drove up to the front door to the time we checked out. The grounds are very big, even though alot of people were staying at the hotel, we never felt crowded. Our room was great, awesome veiw over the gardens and out to sea.The coffee shop in our wing had excellent coffee, the way Australians like it. You can have food such as fast \"take away\" styles, right up to fine dining.The kids club looked after my partners son very well, while we enjoyed some great food and shopping.This is a great place to base yourself, while you drive to the volcanos or shop or whatever. We will be back! ", " We finally returned to the Hilton Waikoloa after an 8 year wait and it was as great as we had remembered. Every employee from check in to check out made it thier mission to insure that we were having a wonderful time. When the maintenance and security folks smiled and asked how your day was, you know they are trained well and truly enjoy thier jobs.The highlights for us were dinner (twice) at the Kamuala Provision company (ask for David , the server), the early morning and late evening walks throughout the expansive property, snorkling with the sea turtles in the lagoon and all of the staff in the executive lounge (say hello to Yoshi, he will make your day).The only sour employee we encountered was the blond haired hostess in the Kirin restaurant. She must have been having a bad day. We imnmediately left and walked to the Palm terrace where we were greeted warmly and had a wonderful dinner.We visited Waipio Valley for the first time and had a blast with the wranglers on the Waipio on Horseback crew. I would highly recommend them. They are a little crazy and loads of fun.Also enjoyed Cafe Pesto for great gourmet pizzas.Lastly, we would skip the sailing trips with Red Sail from the hotel. We canceled our second scheduled trip after a poor experience on the first day. Over crowded, no sailing, left late and returned early, pu pu's were a bowl of snack mix (no scoop so kids stuck there hands in it) uncut fruit. That kind of operation. When we canceled , they didn't seem surprised and never asked why.Overall , the ilton Waikoloa was a spectacular way to spend the holidays and we won't wait another 8 years to return again. ", " This resort is enormous. We stayed there for 6 nights as the last leg of our 2 week Hawaii vacation. Our room was standard and plenty big. They are renovating everything there so the room looke new inside. I have read a lot of complaints about getting around the hotel and having to wait for the tram or the boat. I didn't find this bothersome at all, in fact I walked alot of the time to where I needed to go. The food is quit expensive at the hotel. The best restaurant on the grounds is Donatoni's, excellent food. The chinese restaurant was good as well, I only ate there during lunch. They were nice enough to let me take it with me back to the pool. KPC restaurant has good food and great sunset seating. That is definately a must while you are there. There is a great restaurant at the golf club (make a right out of the Hilton parking lot and make your next left, it will be right there on the right) the food was also excellent there. The pools were crowded but they are so large there is plenty of room for all, and that was even with the biggest one being closed for renovations. The parking isn't bad at all. We self parked for free everyday and the walk back to the lobby is very short. I can't beleive people complain about the parking. The one thing I will say, is if you are vacationing with kids you will love this place. There is so much for a family to do. However, if you are vacationing with just adults as we did, this may not be the place for you as it is large, and has a ton of children. I can't imagine how many kids must be there during the summer. It didn't bother me much, but got old after a few days. The hotel is absoluely gorgeous and I would recommend staying here. By the way they have the most comfortable beds ever in a hotel. The hilton in Oahu, did as well. ", " After planning our trip for almost a year and reading each and every new review that came up, we could not wait to see Hilton Waikoloa for ourselves. It was without a doubt the most beautiful resort that I have ever stayed in. I was definitely nervous about all the bad postings that I had read. Please go for yourself and keep your mind open. Yes there are lots of birds at dusk. They sounded wonderful and early in the morning they are active. They love the trees right by the Lagoon Tower, don't stay there if you don't like wildlife. Request a different tower. As I have two teens the Lagoon Tower is the only place I would have wanted to stay. They have the largest water slide and a great pool. The property was very well maintanned, the beds were comfortable. Our family stayed in the Lagoon Tower, we had a deluxe room. (Free coffee, refrigerator, safe etc.) We had requested a roll away because we have two teenagers with us and still had plenty of room even though there were two beds and the roll away. (The roll away was free) Due to all the previous postings I was aware that the food was supposed to be expensive. We worked around that by stopping by Costco right after leaving the airport and picking up some water, pop and snacks. We purcharsed the breakfast buffet with our room, so it was free daily. For lunch and dinner we enjoyed the more casual dinning that the resort had to offer or went to the Kings Shops for dinner. I did not think that the resorts casual dinning places were over priced. I thought they were average about 8-13.00 per entree. No big deal, for an family of 4 we averaged 60-80 each meal. It costs that much at home, plus we knew about it before we went. It's a resort not Motel 6. There is every kind of activity you might want, plus always a lawn chair available if you just want to relax. There were some days that we had the smaller pools to ourself. The resort is enormous. The trams and boats are quaint and very fun to use. Even my 15 yr old daughter loved the boats. I would be happy to answer any questions anyone has, our email is doodell@comcast.netThank you Hilton, hope to see you soon! ", " Where do i begin? My fiancee and i have traveled the world to many spectacular places and nothing even comes close to comparing to our experience at the hilton! First, ill give you all the good news and then ill tell you how to avoid the things you'd consider bad. THE GOOD- The man made lagoon where you swim with sea turtles and exotic fish, snorkel everyday for about $5.00, paddleboat by the waterfall and plenty other activities. AWAESOME! If you dont like the lagoon there is about 2 miles worth of pools all throughout the resor. these too have waterfalls, cross bridges, and great pacific views. Right on the resort is a dolphin interaction program where you can pay to swim with them, or if not you can get within feet of them and just watch!The resort is so large that transportation to and from areas is provided. there are either boats or trams. if you take boat, expect to see exotic birds within 5 feet of you, and look in the water to see beautiful,colorful fish. The drivers are very friendly, and most times will pick a flower from a tree for you to put in your significant others ear. every which way you turn, no matter where you are on the resort, there are breathtaking views of the pacific, lush landscaping, exotic fish and birds, (even flamingos) and awesome sunsets. There are plenty of restaurants on the resort that are great. For breakfast, go to the buffet at the diner in ocean tower, request to sit by the pond and enjoy watching the waterfall and the hundreds of koi fish.For lunch, there are plenty of little cafes throughout the resort. For dinner, go to the kamuela provision company and request to sit outside. enjoy the sunset, and the pacific views. If you like the spa thing, do a couples seaside cabana massage overlookin the ocean.there is plenty of shopping and food on the resort, but if you want to leave, take the trolley to the kings shops (5min ride) they have plenty of cultural shops and places to eat.NOW HOW TO AVOID THE BAD! sometimes the boats and trams can take awhile,so if your in a rush to make it to your reservation on time, sometimes its better to walk.it takes about 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other.also, if you order drinks at the pool or lagoon from the server who walks around,expect to wait 30-45 minutes. you can have it in 5 minutes if you go to the lagoon grill and get yourself. on this resort you can charge everything to your room, DONT! its too easy not to pull out cash, and when you check out youve got a huge tab, pay cash!everythings expensive, and you get charged for everything. but if you know that going in, its WELL worth it! i would give it ten stars if it were an option!ENJOY! We cant wait to go back! ", " This was our 2nd trip to the Hilton Waikoloa and it was even better than the first. Spent quite a bit more time at the resort this trip and found the grounds to be in top condition. There was a very strong wind storm one night and the next morning at 6:30 when I took my walk, the grounds keepers were out and busy . Some on this site had complained about the poor water quality in the lagoon, but it was crystal clear when I was there. Because I am a Diamond hhonors member we were upgraded to a fantastic suite in the ocean tower but even the standard rooms are large and well appointed. Yes the resort is large and it takes take some effort to get from one end to the other, but your on vacation and how hard is it to take a 10 minute walk through paradise to get to the lobby? We did try all of the restaurants and most were good, Donatoni's was excellent and on the other end Kirin should be avoided, poor quality chinese food at $140 for 2... Overall the resort is excellent, the staff very friendly and there are few places better to go and relax and enjoy time with your family or spouse. PS take the Timeshare tour for 1 1/2 hours and get $100 towards dinner one night. good deal and very little pressure to buy from the staff. ", " This is an excellent hotel with a nice lagoon where you can snorkel every now and then with green turtles. The only problem I have with the hotel is it's high price for rooms (unless you can stay at a government rate!) as well as restaurants and it's kitch transportation system around the property. The artwork around the property is stunning. ", " I just got back from being at the resort for 8 truely wonderful days. I have to say, that before I chose the Hilton that I did look at the reviews here to see what I was getting myself into and I have to say to some of you ... GIVE ME A BREAK!!! For those of you who complain about the walk to the self parking .. I've walked farther getting a parking space at the mall.For those of you who complain about the walk to King's Shops ... it's about 1/2 to 3/4 mile ... unless you don't plan on doing ANY kind of activity in the Island then give me a break, and the shuttle is only $1 if you can't handle it.As for the construction... would you rather they close the whole hotel down or a whole tower and limit availability? Hotels are renovating all the time in order to make YOUR stay BETTER!OK, enough ranting ...I actually do have a few comments on the hotel itself. Those of you who complain about the amount of time it takes to get from one end to the other do have a good concern. While we were there 4 of the 8 days there was only 1 tram running becasue the other was broke. We didn't have any timed plans so it wasn't that big of a deal during that time but when you DO need to be there at a certain time, plan to leave 30 minutes early just in case you just missed a boat or tram. It got old after the 5th day. We were in the Ocean Tower, the farthest away from the main enterance and it only took us about 10-15 minutes to walk it. Not fun with a duffle full of wet scuba equipment but do-able.The staff was GREAT!! As a Hilton Hhonors Diamond I was given a free upgraded room and access to the Executive Suite where we saved TONS of money on Breakfast and snacks at night. Best bet for food is going to Kings Shops for good value. Roy's is highly recommended but pricey.I have seen complaints about the birds on this site. Yes, there are birds near some of the rooms. Get over it. It's an island and the hotel is open air, you can't do anything about it and they are all around. Besides, it's not like they do it all day and night, they are mostly chatty in the mornings and evenings.I highly recommend just taking a walk around the grounds. You'll find all kinds of interesting things there: from the whole Chinese zodiac in statues to a large Budda and interesting wildlife on the small islands where the boats are and even a Nene near the Lagoon Tower. The best of course are the turtles in the larger logoon in back of the main enterance.Also be aware that the resort is 30 minutes fro the airport and about 45 from Kona so be prepared to drive. There is a reason they call it the BIG Island. This is not like the other islands with people all over the place, this is where you can really get a sense of the Aloha way of life. People here are on Aloha time which means: Don't be in a hurry. I would come back here again. ", " We stayed at the Hilton at the end of September 2005 in a wonderful room in the Palace Tower. Most comfortable bed I can recall in a hotel, and a spacious room with a view of the golf course and mountains. Many thanks to previous reviewers for helping us select the hotel.The grounds and artwork are just amazing! We walked a complete circle of the property every morning (a good walk - about 1.5 miles) and thoroughly enjoyed the grounds and the statues throughout. I've posted some photos so you can see for yourself. The boats/tram are fun as long as you're not in a hurry (gosh...you are on vacation after all!) but after 4-5 days the wait does get a little annoying. Yes, it's kind of Disney-like (the boats were actually bought from Disney - watch the driver and note that they never touch the wheel), but I like Disney so it works for me. It's also fun to watch the dolphin adventure, but I'd never pay to actually do it. I kinda felt sorry for the dolphins.The hotel restaurants are very expensive and not very good. Skip them. We ended up at the Kings Shops most nights...I haven't seen anyone mention Merriman's Market Cafe, but we ate (and drank) there often. Do NOT eat at the Big Island Steak House. You definitely will want a car there...but it would be huge mistake not to rent a car wherever you stay. We just loved exploring the whole island, and there is so much to see. We hiked to the guest parking one day, and then decided that valet was the way to go. They charge by the day, and since we were in and out several times a day we though it was worth the price.We also planned to stay at the Mauna Kea, but they had no air conditioning so we moved to the Marriott. Downscale from the Hilton, but a nice change anyway. ", " We stayed there for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the accomodations. They upgraded us to the Palace Tower and we had a room with a view. The sunsets were absolutely spectacular and breathtaking. The staff is very accomodating and gracious. ", " I just returned from a 10 day stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. Without doubt, this was one of the best - if not THE best - resort I have even stayed in. I was a little hesitant after having read so many complaints about transportation delays, food prices, children, parking, etc., but, after having stayed there, I believe that most of these are untrue. First, yes the resort is big - 62 acres or so. That is clearly indicated when you look on the hotel's website, so it should not be a shock. One can walk without a problem anywhere in the hotel (yes, it is hot during the day, but you are on an island, and the walkway is enclosed so you are shaded - although more ceiling fans throughout the island in general would be nice). Otherwise, the trams or boats provide for a nice, relaxing way to get to your destination. We stayed in the Palace Tower (the best in my opinion, since it was away from the hustle and bustle of the lagoon, pools, stores and restaurants but was the most centrally located), and never had a problem getting anywhere in a reasonable time. Yes, sometimes the monorail went down, but it was never a problem. I have heard this system compared to Disney, which I guess I can see somewhat, but since I love Disney (go every December), that wasn't a problem for me. The HWV was far more serene, however.Parking - Before going, I had alternately heard the self parking area approximated at between 1/4 of a mile - a mile away from the main lobby. Personally, we parked there instead of using valet, and the walk was very easy and not far at all - certainly nowhere near a mile. I am sure you do wait for valet, as in any large hotel, but since the valet lot is right next to self parking, why bother paying the $10 per day? Also, we never had any problem whatsoever getting a spot in the self parking lot - EVER! and the hotel was at full capacity supposedly.Food prices were what you would expect at a resort. We usually had breakfast in the room (for convenience, mostly) and then would have a light lunch with cold, tropical beverages at one of the never-over-crowded pools. Yes, the prices were higher than what I would pay for lunch at home in NYC (i.e., $9.00 for a hot dog and fries), but you pay for convenience. Some nights for dinner we went to the Kings Shops, which is a quick, $1 p/p shuttle ride away (doesn't make any sense to me to get your car to drive there, considering the parking lots for the hotel are right near the Kings' Shops' parking areas). Donatoni's was fabulous for dinner (outdoor seating), as was Kamuela's (although I wasn't as thrilled with this as many others are).Our hotel room was on the 7th floor of the Palace tower, with a fabulous ocean view. My only problem came at check-in, when the clerk said she only had a record of my having paid for a garden view room, which was eventually rectified when I spoke to a supervisor (there was another person ahead of me at check-in who had the same problem). Beyond that, I found all the staff I encountered to be wonderful - polite, efficient, and quick, especially the waitress and bartender at the Kona Pool.All in all, we had a fabulous time in a hotel that is pretty close to paradise. We never had an excessive wait for anything, nothing was ever over-crowded or noisy, and we were always able to feel that we had plenty of personal space for relaxation and privacy throughout our stay. In fact, we are already planning to split next summer's trip to Kauai with another stay at the Hilton Waikoloa! ", " My husband, three children, and I just returned from a visit to the Hilton Waikoloa. We stayed four nights, and I wish we could have stayed longer. I was surprised how accurate most of the reviews were. Yes, this place is huge and you will have to walk a little or wait for the tram or boat. If you can put up with this, you will stay at one of the most beautiful hotels you have ever seen. The boat ride takes you by statuary and tropical birds. That was the highlight of our morning ride to breakfast. Be sure to check out the package you get. I would highly recommend that you get a package that includes breakfast, especially if you have children. (Some packages, especially on the Hilton web site include hotel taxes, so this makes them very competitive with regular room rates.) The Palm Terrace charges about $24 per day per breakfast otherwise. Yes, there are birds everywhere, but we had this problem at every outdoor eatery in Hawaii. One disadvantage is that there are very few casual places to eat at the hotel for dinner. The restaurants by the pool close early. We were usually busy during the day and too tired to get dressed for dinner. We just wanted to feed the kids quickly. Another complaint was that most of the casual restaurants had basically the same menu. We did go to the King\u2019s Shops where there is an OK food court with Subway, Dairy Queen, and some other restaurants. We ate one night at Merriman\u2019s. We had the most wonderful fish there. We went early, ate outside and they had a kid\u2019s menu. We did eat at the Oasis at the Hilton for lunch. This restaurant had huge portions, so we split a few sandwiches.All of the staff was very good to us. Our plane was delayed and we were a day late checking in. The front desk treated us very well and gave us rooms by the dolphins. They let us use a changing room, so we could swim while our rooms were prepared. Since we are from the Midwest, we had some jet lag the first couple of nights. It was very cool to see and hear the dolphins in the middle of the night as we sat out on our patio. I had made reservations for Dolphin Quest a few months beforehand. I was surprised how much my 19, 13, and 10 year olds enjoyed this experience.We visited Volcanoes National Park. The Hilton is pretty far away from there and a good 30-45 minute ride to Kona. We drove to the volcano via Hilo. Even though this was a long drive, we did get to see some of the Parker Ranch, waterfalls, and the rainy side of the island. Hard to believe there are so many climates on one island. We went to Maui for a few days after this stay, but I would have liked to spend more time on the Big Island.I thought the Hilton Waikoloa was a wonderful place for a family vacation. I would definitely go again. ", " We saw the Hilton Waikoloa on the travel channel and decided to stay there. We had read all of the reviews on this site and liked what we saw. The Hilton did a great job for us. The resort was everything it claimed it was. Some of the reviews we read made mention of the high prices of food and drink, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? This is a Mega resort. You pay more for what they have, if you are not prepared for that than you have a rude shock coming. There are options if you wish to seek them out. Other reviews complained about the size of the resort and the transportation. We did not wait longer than 5 mins. for the tram or the boats. A little pre-planning does wonders for this.The Staff at the Waikoloa was great. When we arrived we were met by the Bell staff and our bags where taken to our room. The Wait staff and bartenders were magnificent! We never waited for help more than was to be expected and all of the staff were friendly and helpful.Our only complaint came with the Dress code. To eat at Donatoni's, the Italian Restaurant, men needed to wear slacks, collared shirts and close toed shoes. I forgot my shoes so had to spend $75 on new shoes. When we went to the restaruant there were men in shorts, tee shirts and sandals. It was very maddening and the only disappointment We had with the resort.In short, if you are expecting Holiday inn type service and prices do not stay here. If you want a real Hawaiian experience with all of the service Hilton is known for stay here, you will not be disappointed. ", " What a beautiful oasis Hawaii is and the Hilton is a good compliment.. We spent 6 days and 5 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa.. I have 2 kids ages 7 & 9 and they had the best time. The Dolphin program is defiantly something you should consider for any age. The pools were great and the transportation was excellent from 1-side to the other was great using the tram or the boat - they alternate so the wait is minimal. The day camps for kids was great and my 2 loved it so much they were asking to go back - mom and I excepted and granted their wish :-)We had a partial ocean view and the room was a little aged, but clean. It's not a new Hotel that you are accustomed to seeing in Vegas, but is better than average. The beds are excellent and very comfortable... You should take the tram to the shops and get goodies for the room - the inside bar is expensive.By mistake we flew into Hilo and this worked out great surprisingly :)... Everyone we talked to wanted to visit the volcanoes and we did this the first day we arrived. The trip from the Hilton to the volcanoes (Hilo) is lengthy ~2.5 hours and doing that there and back in 1 day plus visting the volcanoes is too much for kids... We took highway 11 driving to the Hilton and 19 back - it was a great to say you drove the entire island and the sights are great...Lastly, put sunscreen on all before starting out into the sun. I would suggest that everyone in your party starts out with SPF 40/45 and lower it gradually for the adults. I witnessed so many people burnt and this can really hamper your enjoyment... You don't realize how powerful that sun is... We lathered-up with SPF 40 and was able to get a tan without burning. ", " I was cheap and selected a room overseeing the \"garden\" (as opposed to looking out to the beach or swimming pool), and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this property. The property is so large it takes at least a day to check out everything it offers. I note that one of the recent writtings to this site from a diamond club member canned the property, it's Hhonors program, and the on-site lagoon. As a gold Hhonors member, I was extremely satisfied with the room, the morning continental breakfast, the cookies and softdrinks at the noonish hour, and the lagoon was great. The lagoon opens up to the ocean, meaning fish and sea turtles swim into this area. Snorkle equipment can be rented and is was fun to swim around and see these things! Separately, there is a huge swimming pool with sliding board, water fall, etc. Although the property is ocean front, there is not a usuable beach;the beach is very rocky. Food is very pricey at this property, and I would have liked to have seen some more reasonable resturants on site. I would suggest going down the street to the Kings shopping area where there is a Roy's. Roy's isn't cheap either -- about $25 to $35, but its cheaper than the good Hilton resturants and it is top notch. ", " We just returned from a six night stay at this hotel which we used Hilton Honors points for. We were a little worried based on some of the negative reviews, but tried to keep a good attitude and say what can you expect for free. Well, everything was perfect!!! We parked in valet parking which was free for us since my husband is disabled and we had a handicap hangtag. But in reality, the self parking is not that far away if you wanted to utilize that. Check in went very smoothly. We probably waited about 10 minutes in the Hilton Honors line, the regular line was very long so it's probably worth joining Hilton Honors just for check-in. We were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 3:00 and we were fine with that since that is the advertised check-in time. They said they would deliver our bags to our room when the room was ready. We opted to go to the lounge in the main lobby for a bite to eat while waiting. Service here was extremely slow. However when the waitress saw how upset we were, she automatically gave us 25% off our bill for the slow service. That more than made up for the bad service. We opted to take the monorail to our room in the Palace tower. The front cars are wheelchair accessible, however you have to use two very narrow ramps to get the wheelchair into the car. After that first ride we opted to walk everywhere. It was just as fast as the monorail and I figured I could use the exercise. We were pleasantly surprised with our room. It was a wheelchair accessible room that had just been remodeled and we had a nice view of the ocean. It was not ocean front, but the view of the water was still great. Our luggage was in our room when we arrived. We needed a shower bench for my husband to use in the shower. It arrived within 15 minutes of our requesting it. We ate at the Provision Company, Donatoni's and Palm Terrace. All very good and not much more expensive than any other resort. We also ate at Bubba Gumps in Kona. Great view, food and friendly servers and fairly reasonable price wise.We really have no complaints about this hotel at all. It is large but it is not all that far to walk and because the hotel is so large it does not seem that crowded. After our 6 day stay here we went to the Hawaiian Village on Oahu for another Hilton Honors stay and we much prefer the Waikola Hilton. In fact we have said we would not return to the Hawaiian Village. I do want to comment a little on W/C accessibility for those who might be disabled. The hotels, restaurants and shops are all very accessible. I even noticed W/C lifts in the shops that did not have ramps. However, if you want to walk along the path by the ocean, go to the lagoon or to the lagoon pool, there are some hills to navigate. I am in fairly good shape and at times I did struggle to push my 180 pound husband and his chair up some of the hills. It was also a bit of a struggle to push him up the monorail ramp the one time we rode it. There are also no companion restrooms, but we solved that by waiting until the restroom was empty and then asking someone to guard the door so I could assist him. The other guests and workers at the hotel were very understanding. All in all, this was a great place to visit. If you are trying to decide which Hilton to use your points at, we highly recommend the Big Island and Hilton Waikola Village. ", " We spent the first 5 nights of our honeymoon at the Hilton Waikaloa Village. We had an ocean view room in the ocean tower. We did not find the walk to be bad and we were in one of the further rooms from the lobby. We did take advantage of the tram or boat when we were carrying packages however.We really enjoyed the food at this hotel. I can't say that we had one bad meal there. We ate one of the buffet dinners at the Palm Court (Prime Rib and Seafood), at the Kamuela Provision company (expensive but good), had yummy hamburgers at the grill place by the pool, and of course had the buffet breakfast every day (included with our stay). We would have been really disappointed if we had to pay for the breakfast. If it wasn't included with your package I would try to negotiate at the front desk when you check in because it seemed like some people got it included and some didn't. We also ate at Big Island Steak house in the King's shops and the meal wasn't bad either. More reasonably priced than the fancy restaurants at the resort.The grounds at this hotel were beautiful and lush and were one of the nicest that we had seen. There were many hammocks, cabanas, and places to sit, relax, and enjoy the view.One complaint was that our last 2 nights the hotel really filled up and it was difficult to find a place to self park; we ended up circling the lot a couple of times and got lucky enough to see someone pull out. It isn't fair to be forced to pay the $10 for valet when you just want to park it yourself. We saw a girl negotiate and get the valet fee waived since the self park wasn't available. The self park lot wasn't that far from the door so it wasn't worth justifying the $10 fee.We did see some evidence of \"nickel and diming\" - like the $3.50 per day to use their safe. What does that tell us, that they expect their employees to steal and if we don't want our stuff stolen we have to pay them to use their safe? That was kind of dumb.We did not have to pay for coffee from the minibar. We joined Hilton Honors and they gave us 2 bottles of water and our first packet of coffee for free. But we left the maid a small tip and she kept leaving us coffee every day.I requested a fridge to store drinks in and they did not charge me anything for it. Apparently some of the remodled rooms have fridges and the older ones don't. If your room had a fridge already you wont be charged for it, but if it doesn't have a fridge you will. I told them that I was told by the front desk (I was) that the room would have a fridge so they didn't charge me.They gave us a free bottle of champagne since we were on our honeymoon, which was nice. Also, free champagne at the restaurant with dinner.Our last day they started remodeling the pool by the ocean tower/palace tower so I'm glad that we got to enjoy it.Although I had a few complaints overall I really enjoyed this hotel and may consider it again if I ever go to the Big Island of Hawaii. ", " My husband and I visited here for 6 days last year. To be honest, we weren't expecting much more than mega-vacation-resort atmosphere. He had a conference he had to attend and I tagged along. I packed several books and thought I'd just make the best of it. After reading some of the reviews on this board, we really wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. We went in off-season and the hotel was fairly full the last 2 days we were there.We are still talking about what a great time we had.The property is divided into 3 areas that are serviced by water taxis and a monorail. I found nothing to complain about. I liked the fact that the property was so spread out. Waiting a few minutes for a ride to the lobby or another area didn't bother me at all. With a little effort, it wasn't hard to find a quiet spot. The grounds are beautiful and well cared for. There are plenty of lounge chairs and hammocks along the walkways near the water. We love to walk, and we enjoyed finding new things each day that we were there. The walkway that follows the monorail is somewhat of an open air museum and has many different items on display from Polynesia and Asia. Take some time to smell the plumeria.Our room was nicely laid out with a small balcony and was a great place to relax. We somehow ended up with an ocean view room instead of the garden view that we had booked in anticipation of a so-so stay. The bed was one of the more comfortable I have found in a hotel. We got a fridge and picked up some snacks and drinks from a supermarket to resist the urge to munch out of the minibar.We ate most meals there at the nicer Hilton restaurants. We both enjoy good food and were not disappointed. The portions were generous, but be prepared for the price tag. Some days we preferred to eat a larger mid afternoon meal that was generally less pricey than dinner. Be aware that some of the restaurants there in the off-season may not be open every day. We had to wait 3 days to try Imari, but we had no shortage of options. Reservations recommended.A friend raved about the Kohala Spa.If the Hilton Waikoloa seems a little artificial sitting on the edge of dry lava fields to either side of it, I think it has to be enjoyed for what it is. An oasis doesn't look any worse for sitting in the middle of a desert. I was expecting something that looked and felt irritatingly Orlando-ish but somehow dropped onto the Big Island. Yes, it's a large resort with pools that have a waterfall. Yes, there are dolphins in one corner on the site. However, I found that there was more to it than that. It's a beautiful place to explore and a great choice for unwinding. This wasn't my first trip to Hawaii, and probably not my last to the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " I went to the Hilton Waikoloa Village for my honeymoon about a year ago. I am writing this now because some of the reviews written about this hotel are completely unfair. My husband and I travel quite a bit and this hotel was great! Expensive? Of course, but what would you expect, it's Hawaii! I didn't see a single bug the whole time I was at the Hilton, the staff couldn't have been nicer and more attentive. The bartenders were extremely helpful, valets extremely outgoing and literally would run to open your door for you. Desk staff upgraded our room upon arrival because it was our honeymoon. We hardly left the resort. I would recomend this hotel to anyone. ", " My family and I stayed at this hotel for 6 days and had a GREAT time. I too was a bit put off by some of the less than stellar reviews, and I am a bit pickey but I am so glad that we stayed.I'll start with the negatives, there are a few.The kids club is terrible. It only has organized events for older children in the evening on Friday and Saturday and my daughter said the staff was less than nice. In fact, she told me that the \"teacher\" was a bit lazy and yelled A LOT. They did want to go back and were able to one more time to make volcanos which is one of their more treasured souviners. In six days they were only able to visit twice. It was never open and no note was left with the status of the day.Yes, the grounds are huge. We enjoyed walking and occasional waited for the tram but more often walked. We discovered that you could cut the walk in half by cutting across the middle of the resort. There are many bridges and we could get from our room in the palace tower to the water slide in less than 10 minutes.The good:The rooms are large, clean and nicely decorated. The beds were very comfortable. Room service was prompt and kind. No bugs to be seen at any time but there is a friendly lizard that hangs out at the tram pick up. The tv is large and the closet is seperate from the room and LARGE so there were no stepping over suit cases and there were plenty of hangers.We ate at almost every resturant on the grounds and did not have a bad meal. Yes, they are expensive and if you are on a budget I would suggest going off grounds but save a special dinner for one of the places on the grounds. I'll put them in order of best to very good:Donatoni's was EXCELLENT. We ate on the patio at sunset and it was probably the most memorable meal of the trip. Our children joined us (7 & 9) and also enjoyed it they do have a childrens menu. I had a great rib eye steak and my husband had the lasgana, both fantastic. The wine list is fair and the service was top notch. I recommed making reservations for the patio.The japanese resturant was also very good. The sushi was the freshest I had since being in Japan. The building is beautiful and they open the doors for a lovely breeze, very enjoyable.The Orchid by the main pool has great food, I recommend the angus burger and the mai tai's. This is also pricey, 2 burgers, 2 hot dogs and 2 mai tai's was about $70.The breakfast buffet is also good but the birds drove me CRAZY!If you get to the Kings shop, eat at the Big Island Steakhouse. It is not a deal but the food is great, the coconut shrimp is tasty.Kirin the chinese restuarnt is nice but the least impressive.If you are there on a Wednesday evening I recommend the movie night at the large pool. They put up a big screen and you can sit out on the pool chairs and enjoy the evening, your family, popcorn (free) and hot dogs (not free).Dont miss the sunset, they are spectactular! The hamocks are strategicaly placed through out the resort.The Spa is fair the staff nice.The dolphin encounter is a do not miss.The glow in the dark gold is a great time for a family.We had a great time and planning our return trip. I highly recommend this hotel. ", " We loved this hotel. Were very fortunate that it was not fully booked and in fact were able to upgrade our room to an ocean view. Had we booked a week earlier or later, it would have been packed with Japanese tourists for their respective holidays of the Emperor's Birthday and then, after we left, Golden Week. We were able to secure a cabana if we staked one out around 8 am & luxuriated in every sunset spectacle and acompanying Hawaiian ceremony in our hammock overlooking our ocean cove! If it sounds like paradise, it was. Restaurants were good, but the best cuisine we found at the King's Shops - Merriman's Restaurant! A real treasure, fairly priced and excellent service. Best recommendation unless you are looking for a family vacation with many other families - find a time when the hotel is not fully booked. You'll get far better rates and access to all the facilities, amenities and waterslides without lines. DOLPHINS - of course we experienced the Dolphin Encounter! That's the main reason we chose the hotel! ", " We stayed at the Big Island Hilton for 6 nights from 5/21/05 - 5/27/05. Our stay was free through our Hilton Honors credit card points, Silver VIP members. We stayed in the Palace Tower, with a garden view, beds & pillows very comfortable. Being Hilton Honors Silver members gave us free USA Today delivered to our door each morning, free roll-away, free in-room coffee + 2 - bottles of water free from the in-room mini-bar. Due to previous bad reviews regarding the quality of food & high prices at the restaurants & since we had a mini-frig in our room, we chose to purchase food at a grocery store & make our own breakfasts & lunches.In the evenings, we drove into Kona to eat. We had a rental van, one thing about the parking, there is no fee, unless you use valet. However, we've never seen such small parking spaces or so little room to manuever your car in & out of your parking spot. One night, it was even difficult to find an available space to park. We went to the 9:00 am orientation provided by the resort in the Lounge by the lobby. He was fantastic, very helpful ideas on how to see the island. We booked our Blue Hawaiian 2 - hour helicopter ride thru the Hilton's American Express desk. We enjoyed traveling around the resort by tram & boat, we even saw \"Elvis\" the Hilton's barracuda in the waterway a couple of times! We also enjoyed just strolling through the resort, (someone lovingly called this resort not the Waikola, but the Walk-a-lot). It was great watching the dolphins, seeing the flamingos & tropical fish ponds. Since, we had 4 - adults in our party, we enjoyed the Kona Pool with the bigger slide, the Lagoon Beach, (enjoyed snorkeling with the turtles & tropical fish) & the hammocks. Late afternoon, we would head to the Ocean Tower Adult Pool for the comfy lounge chairs & a siesta. Every employee we encountered in the resort was great to work with. The only negative thing we encountered was, since they were booked on the day of our departure, we could not get a late check-out & they did not have a hospitality room available for our use.Overall, we had a great experience at the Hilton Waikoloa & would not hesitate to return to this resort, we had a great time on the Big Island. ", " I'm glad I read all the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor before I went to the Big Island. I booked two rooms through PL hoping for the Hapuna Prince, so I was disappointed when I got the Hilton Waikoloa. But now that I personally got to experience the Hilton, I can happily say that I thoroughly enjoyed this resort. Yes, it's very large, with many kids and conventions, and taking the trams and boats are a drag if you're in a hurry to get somewhere. And yes we ended up spending more dining there than the room amounts.But it's a very enjoyable place for families, especially viewing the Atlantic dolphins. The pools are fun, even for adults (especially the one at the Lagoon Tower), and there's even a sand kiddie pool for my one-year old. We enjoyed our dinner at the fairly elegant Donatoni's, but the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Restaurant was only fair and overpriced. We ended up in a lagoon and ocean view room in the ring of the Ocean Tower closest to the ocean. The rooms were of decent-size, well-appointed with nice bedding. The bathroom is fairly small and not worth mentioning. The Hilton definitely is substandard compared to other resorts in Kohala, but it sure beats staying anywhere in Kona except maybe the Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort. I could understand people being disappointed with it if they paid the full rack rate, but I found it to be a terrific value compared to other Kohala resorts. ", " My husband and I stayed for 9 days on our honeymoon. It was part of a great package so it was not too pricey. We spent more time adventuring the great island then we did in our hotel but after 6 when every thing every where else shuts down we took long walks around the hotel enjoying its many sights. I recommend bringing some snacks with you to store in your room because there is not any where to just run out and get a cheap burger with in 20 miles. There is a italian restaurant on site(cant recall the name) that cost roughly $100.00 for a meal for two. TOTALLY worth it though! The room was nice and clean, we woke up our first morning to the wales migrating in the ocean , dolphins in the lagoon and a mountain peak all in one! Find your souvenoirs elsewhere though, very cheap if you head into town. Last but definitely not least rent a jeep and see the green beach and there is a secluded beach off the main highway i think it is labled kueka kai state park??? You drive through approx 2 miles of rough but roaded lava field to a secluded and emaculate beach and there you may still find \"kai\" a extremely friendly kitty, his food dishes and notification not to steal him he is well cared for by the few frequenters of this beach. LIke i said explore outside the hotel. ", " I have been checking tripadvisor for months to get an idea of what to expect during our vacation at the Hilton Waikoloa. There were several bad reviews (I was a bit worried), and then interspersed would be awesome reviews. So, the time came for me to decide for myself. We just got back this morning and for the life of me I can not figure out how any one can complain. The staff were all so helpful, the maid service was outstanding, the room was gorgeous, the pools were great, the boats and trams were a great way to get around the huge property, the valet were efficient, etc. ", " We thoroughly enjoyed our accomodations at the HiltonWaikoloa. It offered everything of Hawaii except the lava. It was a destination in itself and we would have been content to just stay there had this not been our first trip to Hawaii, and we wanted to explore the island. Coming back to the Hilton after a busy day was heavenly. We found the help to be very polite and helpful. We had left the room without a key, and a new one was issued quickly and with no hassles. We were impressed with the ocean view and the ability to snorkel right outside our room in Ocean Tower. We walked to the nearby A-Bay state park to enjoy the beach and surf. Yes, the resort is large, but it is away from the hustle and commotion we found at the Hilton on Waikiki. I'm so glad we made the choice to stay the 6 nights at Hilton Waikoloa rather than Hilton Waikiki. Thank you Hilton for a wonderful experience. I would recommend it to anyone. ", " My fiance and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Jan 2005 and we had a wonderful time!!! The first thing you will realize about the Hilton is that it is huge!! (the monorail that runs throughout the hotel should have been our first clue!) Our room was in the Palace Tower, so it was a bit of a walk to get to the lobby and the pool everyday, but we didnt mind it much. the hotel itself is beautiful--the landscaping, the pools, everything looks spectacular. The rooms are great--very clean and the beds are very comfortable. (the down comforters in the rooms are a nice touch!!!) The staff was also incredible!! Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful!!! There isnt a beach on the hotel property, but its just a 10-15 minute walk to get to the beach, so its not too bad. The pools were great though!! we especially enjoyed the kona pool--the waterfall and slide were great! And we never had to wait for a loungechair at the pools, even though the hotel was crowded the week we were there. We also checked out the Kohala Spa--kinda pricey and our massages were average. We booked our tours at the American Express Travel Desk---they were also very helpful!!! We went to Volcanoes National Park--unbelievable!!!!!! we recommend on getting there for the sunset!! its very beautiful and once it gets dark, you can see the lava so well!! its an amazing site!!! just make sure you bring sneakers, water and a flashlight!! you dont have to hike alot to see the lava if you dont want to, but you will need the flashlight once the sun goes down!!! Overall, we enjoyed the big island of Hawaii very much and we had a wonderful time staying at the Hilton Waikoloa Village!! Mahalo to all the staff there!!! =) ", " Took our extended family (11 people) to the Hilton Waikoloa for our wedding. We had a great time. The water slides and pools were great. We swam in the lagoon and everyone, all eleven of us had plenty of activities to keep us occupied. Our kids say the mono-rail was \"so cool\". we got married right on the grounds and couldn't have imagined a better day. The staff was very nice. The grounds were beautiful and the breakfast was good. We've been to Maui, Honalulu and Kau many times, this is by far our favorite. The kids had lots to explore. We even swam with some sea turtles. Everything was fun and amazing. The wedding planners were great and things went very smoothly. ", " My husband I just returned from a 6-night stay at the property, where we were married a year ago. We had another great stay, and were treated very well. My husband is a Diamond member, and we had another suite and were welcomed with chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of sparkling cider, as my husband had sent the General Manager a note before hand to let them know we were celebrating our first anniversary and the expectancy of our daughter in June.There's no question that the Hilton is a mega resort, however, there are plenty of opportunities to find quiet places. Having been to the island a year ago, we spent more time relaxing at the property this time. Sunsets by the Kamuela Provision Company (KPC) are spectacular. We recommend getting a drink at the KPC bar, letting them know that you are going to drink it watching the sunset on the grass - they'll put the drink in a plastic cup. We walked along the rocky shore and had lunch one afternoon at the Marriott which is next store - made for a nice walk, and we only encountered two people along the way. For restaurants, we were impressed with the Kamuela Provision Company. We ate at Kirin, and recommend requesting a table on the lanai. We also did Tepanyaki at Imari, though I was not overly impressed. Our best dinner was at the Four Season's Hualalai Grille - and we were very stunned to find that their prices were no more than the restaurants at the Hilton. There's a great bar with tables on the sand as well at the Four Seasons. We had drinks (virgin for me!) there before our dinner. We met several couples while having breakfast on the Executive Lounge.This venture we went to the Volcano Park, which I highly recommend. Best to get to the lava flow at sunset. Don't forget flashlights. The Hilton gave us two, and while we put brand new batteries in them, both of our bulbs burned out on the trek back! The pools are cold, but refreshing. The warmest pool is by the Ocean Tower, the one that is not connected to the small slide and that is elevated in relation to the others. We also found that this pool was well protected from the wind. With respect to cabanas and chaise lounges, lots of people claim theirs in the morning, putting down towels - only to not appear for hours on end, which is not considerate of other guests. It would be nice if the staff could monitor the practice so that all guests can enjoy the spots, especially those over toward Budah Point, where there is more privacy.The bed was very comfortable, and we slept with the sliding doors open every night. There are birds, but we found them to go well with the tropical environment, and we were not unable to sleep because of them. There was twice daily service, and the staff were always courteous. The last two nights we spent at the Hapuna Beach Prince (which we did last year as well), which we found to be certainly quieter, however, the bed was horrible making it impossible to get a full night of rest. The coils were loud and umcomfortable.My last comment is on the size of the Hilton. Yes, it is large. I agree with another reviewer that the valet is not worth it. While the parking lot is far from the Ocean Tower, it is a great opportunity to walk off the extra calories consumed while on vacation! ", " My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Waikaloa Village for 3 nights in January, 2005. We had a blast. When we arrived, the valet parked our car and we didn't have to worry about it until we wanted to drive to the volcanos. We checked in and got a very nice room with a view of the golf course in the Palace tower. This resort is unique in the sense that you can either take romantic little boats like fantasy island to your hotel wing. Or, you can take a bart-like tram. The rooms are very nice with down feather pillows and plenty of them, and a nice clean comfortable bed. You can get a minibar in your room if you want, and we did take advantage of the mini bar as well as shopping for local treats like kona coffee and oither snack goodies at the nearby kings shopping center. One night we ate at the Kirin restaurant and the orange chicken and orange beef were to die for. The pools are awesome at this hotel. There are huge waterfalls going into the pool that you can swim under and there are lots of slides going into the pools as well as secluded jacuzzis. The grounds are so lush and romantic, as is the lagoon with salt water turtles. A perfect spot for a wedding! The spa there is very nice too. In response to some of the earlier reviews here, yeah there may be birds flying around in the outdoor restaurants but we found them entertaining and fun to watch, and plus it's Hawaii so expect to be surrounded by wildlife! The tiki torches at night added a nice romantic touch. There is so much to do at the Waikaloa and we recommend it as a vacation that you will absolutely LOVE! ", " My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a week at the end of January. We had an absolutely wondeful time. We read all of the reviews before our trip and I was a little nervous. I wanted to address some of the previous concerns that made me nervous and share our thoughts on our trip.1. Yes, Hawaii is expensive. I think if you go into the trip knowing you are going to pay a lot for food, you will have a much better vacation. In general, whenever we have gone to resorts, we are used to paying more money - I didn't think the Hilton was that out of line. Another tip that has been mentioned before - stop at a grocery store and stock up. We went to the grocery store in Waikoloa Village (about 10 minutes away) and bought wine, beer, pop, snacks, etc. It was nice to have this in our room - be sure to request a mini-fridge as well.2. Parking. We valet parked every day for $10.50 a day. I think it was well worth the money. We would call the valet stand before we needed our car and by the time we got to the entrance, the car was waiting for us. I think it was money well spent.3. Size of the resort. Yes, the Hilton is a huge resort. However, we actually liked that aspect of this place. Over the course of a week, I don't remember waiting more than 10 minutes for the monorail train. It really does not take that long to walk either. Just keep in the back of your mind that it will take a little bit of time to get to the front of the resort. You are not going to get from your room to the entrance in 5 minutes, but I didn't think that was a bad thing.4. Restaurants. We absolutely loved our meal at the Provision Company. We went on our last night and it was FABULOUS! We went early in the evening, sat on the patio and watched the sunset. Romantic and great food. We ate at all of the casual restaurants and the food was good - nothing spectacular, but good food nonetheless.5. Birds. Yes, there are birds, but as others stated, it is Hawaii - there will be birds. I will admit they were hard to take the first night. Things got better the second night - either we were used to them or having the tv on low all night helped. On a side note, we never saw any bugs in our room at all.6. Service. We had great service at the restaurants and from hotel staff. Everyone was friendly, helpful and a nice bartender gave us free drinks (just because)! 7. Snorkeling. This was one area that I was disappointed in. We snorkeled in the lagoon and the water was so cloudy. You could see sunscreen oil floating on top of the water. One of the staff recommended going early in the morning, which did help a lot.8. Water temp. Granted, we are from Minnesota, but we really didn't think the water was cold at all. It was sunny and 80 every day and felt great!Outside of the Hilton:I would highly recommend the Blue Hawaiian helicopter tour. It is expensive, but was the highlight of our trip.Kona is fun to look around and do some shopping - we had a great meal at the Kona Brewing Company.We went to a luau at the Mauna Kea resort - absolutely wonderful and your picture is taken at sunset (nice souvenir).We had an outside couples massage at the Mauna Lani resort, which was great. We wanted to have one at the Hilton, but they were booked 2 weeks out (note - be sure to book this far in advance if you want one).We drove to Pulula (sp?) Valley (the northern tip of the island) and hiked down the cliff to a black sand beach. It was absolutely wonderful, but be prepared for the 400 foot hike back up! ", " My husband and I just returned from 5 days at the Hilton and had an amazing trip!!!!After reading countless reviews here I had some concerns but a little pre-planning and knowledge went a long way to ensuring an excellent vacation :)After hearing about the bird concerns we requested the Palace Tower and because of Hilton Gold VIP were upgraded to the top floor with an Ocean View. We slept with the sliding glass closed and thus never had sleep issues associated with birds. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and everything was very new which is because the Palace Tower was recently renovated.Valet parking is definitely worth the $10.50 but we never felt we had to wait when we wanted to take monorail or boat, that being said we walked pretty much everywhere and found it was a fun way to see lots of places around the resort.I echo the suncreen comments about the lagoon as we went late in the afternoon and could see fish and eels clearly in some spots and nothing at all in others due to cloudy water but my husband and I both got to swim with sea turtles which was a highlight. We LOVED the huge waterslide and never had issues finding cabanas or loungechairs. The water temp was a little cool but once you're in it was awesome.On the food front: DEFINITELY bring beer, soda, bottled water and some snacks as food is expensive. We had a refrigerator in our room and this was helpful for late evenings and the mornings. We ate most lunches at the Dolphin cafe and were impressed with the large portions (Garden Burger was about $10 including french fries). Due to Gold VIP we had free breakfast which was a bit disappointing as most Hiltons have great lounges with snacks throughout the day and water and sodas you can take with you. Not the case at Waikoloa (the lounge is open 6:30am-2pm) but we did enjoy the fresh fruit, local pastries and cereal etc in the am and soda and cookies around noon.All in all we had a fantastic time, enjoyed the pools, lagoon, surroundings and each other. We can't wait to go back. BYOB and have a blast!!!!! ", " Paradise has a name...and it is the Hilton Waikoloa. I just returned from a 12 day stay with husband and two kids (4 and 7). We had a wonderful time. The hotel is big, but beautifully kept. Lovely grounds, and a fantastic art gallery walkway between towers. Although train and boat were cute, and a great hit with the kiddies, we preferred to walk around. We spent two nights at the Palace Tower, and the rest of our stay at the Ocean Tower (we wanted an ocean view and a king size bed instead of partial ocean and two double beds). The Ocean Tower is furthest away from the Main Lobby, but we had no problem at all walking to and from the lobby, the pools, the lagoon, or our car. It really is not THAT far, and all the beautiful artwork and lush grounds made the walk a pleasure.The staff was super-friendly, the only surly one we met was at one of the pool towel outlets. But she only re-enforced our awareness of the general aloha-spirit. Housekeeping was amazing: our room was spotless every afternoon, and that was no easy feat with two messy kids in tow...I highly recommend the coconut lotion, which was replenished every day in our room.The lagoon was great, we snorkled and swam with the turtles. The pools are a bit on the cool side, but the slides were awesome. Sunsets were AMAZING, and a good time to whale-watch. Food was fine at the Lagoon grill, the Palm Terrace and the Provision Co. I would not call the food outstanding, but it was good and, best of all, family friendly!The hotel was fully booked for most of our stay, but it never felt overcrowded. There was always a lounger to be had at the pool or the lagoon.All in all, a fantastic place to visit. We were bummed to leave and cannot wait to go back! ", " WOW... was the feeling we had from the moment we arrived to the last fleeting glance we had of this beautiful place. My family of four adults spent Jan 15 - 17 here. The bellmen greeted us in the drive with a smile and loaded our bags immediately. The lobby was beautiful and spacious with lots of seating. We were greeted with iced punch prior to check-in, and I've seen them serving coffee some mornings. Upon check-in we received a nice little packet with hotel info and a chance to win a prize.As we boarded the mahogany boats, we took in the breathtaking and enticing views from the lobby. We truly felt like we were somewhere special. The grounds are immaculate and filled with unique wildlife. We stayed in the Ocean tower. The room was very clean and spacious. The beds and bedding were also VERY comfortable and inviting. We had a garden view room on the ground floor in the loop farthest from the ocean. The view was ok, nothing spectacular. The room was quiet most of the time, but we did hear footsteps above one morning. I booked via AAA & Northwest WorldVacations at $175 / night. Once in the room we also found another envelope for a free gift. Small memorabilia, but still nice.We spent the first day walking around and exploring the grounds\u2026 it took us a couple of hours between stopping and watching the dolphins, pink flamingos, jumping fish, sea turtles\u2026 ahhh need I say more? Our first dinner was at Kamuela Provision Co. The evening was very windy so they had closed the patio, but opened it back up later. We had the option of waiting for them to set it back up or take a table inside. We waited (a bit of a while), but the gorgeous view was worth it. Service is slow in all of the restaurants, which can be nice if you want to relax and enjoy the view. The food was very good but the stray cats were an annoyance.The next day we had breakfast at the Palm Terrace and ordered ala carte since the buffet was so expensive. We each ordered dishes and shared among ourselves. The fruit platter was large enough for all four of us. Never leave your food unattended though \u2013 the birdies will nibble on it. The Palm Terrace and Orchid Caf\u00e9 have the same menu, but the Terrace has beautiful waterfalls along one side of the restaurant. On this day we drove our rental car to Hilo (everyone says it\u2019s a 2.5 hour drive but it only took us 1.5 hours; give yourself 2 hrs to be safe). We visited Big Island Candies, a must stop for chocolate lovers! Then off to the airport for a helicopter ride. It was exciting and awe inspiring. Our pilot was an excellent tour guide and knew a lot of history. We have used both Safari and Sunshine\u2026 neither one of their videotapes came out with sound \u2013 so if you buy a tape check the quality and sound first. We also ate at Caf\u00e9 Pesto in Hilo. Great food for a great price and nice live band. That evening we dined at Donatoni's. The view was again beautiful and the food divine. We ordered three different desserts\u2026 pricey but really, how often will you be here. We ordered \"The Mask\", a specialty chocolate dessert that sells out I hear, the Neapolitan Ice Cream Bombe and their unique apple dessert. Superb! We were hoping to see the live entertainment floating on the waterway as they display on their website, but they cancelled that a long time ago. My husband and I took an evening stroll and sat in the cushy lounge chairs to watch the big waves roll in. It was so romantic and peaceful. We had wished that we had booked this hotel for a longer period, but it was our third island.On our final day we relaxed poolside. The water was chilly but you got use to it. The big water slides were fun (one at each pool), the little ones were mainly occupied by kids. We found that the lagoon chairs go quick so if you want one, reserve it early\u2026 around 8 or 9ish. The lagoon was clean and clear, only sometimes did you spot sun tan oil on the surface. And they have these great little floats for kids who can't snorkel. You can seat your kid on the float that has a view window and he/she can snorkel right along with you. We did see a sea turtle briefly and all kinds of fish. The nicest thing about the pools is that all the lounge chairs (covered or not) are free.If you awaken early enough you can see the trainers feeding the dolphins around 7:30 - 8am. We may stay in the Lagoon Tower just to have this joy in the mornings. Inside the Lagoon Tower the birds were noisy but it seemed to stop in the evenings. One guest wondered if it wasn't a recording.We stopped at the King's Shops on our way to the airport. It was a nice cozy outdoor area with great pizza. There is a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your fast food overlooking a pond\u2026 nice touch!All in all, a wonderful place to visit and we can't wait to return!!! Enjoy your trip\u2026 Aloha ", " We were here Dec. 13 for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon and we loved it! It was so relaxing, it seemed like no one was there. The pools were great, not to mention the slides! Our room was in the Ocean Tower with a breathtaking view. The room was clean with King size cushy bed and plenty of space otherwise. We received a free bottle of champagne since we were on our honeymoon. We usually walked to and from the car, wait was long for the tram and boat, but the walk was only 10-15 minutes and didn't seem bad at all. We went 10 minutes up the road to Hapuna Beach State park and the beach was great, nice sandy bottom and very clean. We drove into Kona one evening and there are a variety of choices for dinner. We also ate at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel and it was quite tasty as well. For lunch the shopping center near the hotel had pizza, subway, dairy queen, etc. Overall, a perfect start to our honeymoon!!! ", " Ok..Read all the negative reviews posted here and just had to think..Are these people talking about the same resort?? This place was fabulous..Yes a bit pricey, but it is Hawaii and it is a Hilton. Our room was immaculate and right on the golf course which couldn't of been quieter. We enjoyed the pool, we didn't find it over crowded with children. It is so large, if there were children its easy enough to re-locate to another spot. We were never inconvienced by long tram waits, it was always accessible. We found the staff to be friendly and accomadating. We did go for the dolphin on the bed, but I think it was $18.00..But who cared?? We loved the dolphins and the Dolphin Quest program. If you are staying at a resort such as this, one needs to be prepared to pay alittle extra. We absolutley loved The Provision Co. on top of the cliff watching the sun set and the whalesjumping as we enjoyed our dinner. We loved the grounds and really didn't mind walking to get to hotel destinations within. We will definitely return. I just think people tend to forget they are on Aloha time.. Just relax and enjoy it!! ", " We just spent a week, including Christmas, here, and loved it. Sure, it's expensive, but everything is expensive in Hawaii and especially if you're at a resort. This is one of the most beautiful hotels we've ever been to. You can spend most of a week here and find something to do. Some reviewers have complained about the wait for the tram or boat, but we never had to wait long for either. Our favorite spot was the lagoon, where my 11-year-old son and husband had fun with the rented sun floats and snorkel equipment. We saw lots of fish and some sea turtles. The fish come right up to you looking for food. We always found a spot with lounge chairs on the sand. Water shoes are recommended. Some reviewers have complained about the restaurants here. They are pricey -- I would say meals cost a little more than San Francisco or New York restaurants. But the food was better than we expected. We had two meals at Kamuela Provisions. The first, in which we ordered seafood, was terrific. We had the local beef in the second meal, and would not recommend it -- very chewy. The restaurant by the Palace Tower offers an eat-all-you-want buffet. The food was quite good but the view of the waterfalls and pond is fabulous. The resort staff was friendly and helpful. The valets were great. We highly recommend the valet service -- you're spending so much money already, $10.50 daily is not going to break the bank and it's worth not having to trek back and forth to the parking lot. We found our room in the Lagoon Tower a little cramped with the sofabed out but it was clean. The lotion from the Kohala Spa is heavenly; I bought some to take home. Surprisingly, the resort stores were not outrageously pricey. In fact, I found some things that cost less than they would have been in the San Francisco Bay area. Make sure to check your bill before you leave. We found a charge for a restaurant we had not gone to tacked on. We had an all-round very pleasant stay here. ", " WOW!!! A huge resort hotel with endless beauty and things to do. If you don't like big this is NOT the place for you. Although it is so big you could manage to get lost...haha There is a boat that takes you to the rooms and dinner and wherever...WAY COOL...Service good. The Japanese restaurant was excellent. (I'm Japanese so you know...) The pools are great. There is an adult pool and an everyone pool. They both have pool slides. The only prob. is they are very far from one another. But hey your on vacation...who cares. My 9 year old son did the Dolphin Encounter. A MUST FOR CHILDREN!! We bought the movie... I'd pass not worth the $. The lounge chairs go quick if they're in a good spot so wake up and go put your towels and belongings out... All in all I'd stay again in a heart beat...you will not be disappointed!! ", " When I first decided to stay at the Hilton, I read many reviews of people who had so kindly posted their opinions, and those people who had the unfortunate experience of having a bad time, I truly feel sorry for them. My wife and I celebrated our honeymoon there from Oct 25 to Nov 1st, and we had to drag ourselves from the place. The hotel is very big and spectacular. The food is expensive and not always worth the money, but the experience and atmosphere is worth every penny. The endless activities were great, but I highly encourage you to rent a car. The nearby Kona coast is a very enjoyable and peaceful drive, where food, shopping, and sight seeing are all reasonably priced. While yes it is true that there is not a natural white sand beach on property, the breath taking lava being pounded by the pacific waters makes up for it, and in reality most of the states best beaches are only a 5 to 10 minute drive away, and the drive is most definitely worth it. The hotel staff was great and was nice enough to upgrade me to a deluxe ocean view room in the Ocean tower where we had great views of the golf course, ocean, and beautiful sunsets. I highly recommend this resort and am looking forward to returning sometime in the near future. ", " After circling the entire Big Island and viewing many resorts, the Hilton was the only choice for us! This resort is a destination in itself. It is stunning and the service was superb - better than the Ritz Carlton. They are doing everything right at this hotel. We would definitely come back to stay here. We loved it! ", " We spent the week of October 18th at the Waikoloa. After reading many reviews I really did'nt know what to expect. From the minute my husband and I checked in we were treated like we were their only guests. We arrived a little early so our room was not ready. The bellman took our our luggage said it would be in our room as soon as it was ready and then gave us a great tour of the resort. Our room was in the Lagoon Tower. The room was spacious with a beautiful ocean view.As far as being pricey, no more than any other resort. I guess if you have never traveled or stayed at a resort before the cost of food and drinks might seem out of line. And as far as resort food goes, we found the restaurants at the Waikoloa to be better than most. We had a very romantic sunset dinner on the terrace at the Kamuela Provision Company. The grounds are beautiful and well kept and we enjoyed morning and evening walks. The pools are huge and we never had trouble getting a drink, there was always pool service. There is one thing, the pools are cold, cold, cold. We spent a couple of days laying by the lagoon and we really enjoyed that. We had fun snorkling in the lagoon and there was a lot of fish and sea turtles. As far as children go, it is a true pardise for them, but visiting in October most are back in school. So if you are looking for a more layed back vacation, I recommend a fall visit. While on the Island we looked at all the other resorts, and we were so happy we made the decision to stay at the Waikoloa Village. ", " Just got back! I can't believe how fast our vacation went. We had the best time!! The Hilton Waikokloa is fabulous! I highly recommend it. It's very clean, friendly and gorgeous. Whenever we needed something from housekeeping (like towels, coffee or shampoo) they delivered the items within 5 minutes! I am not kidding! Be prepared to be spoiled by the people at this resort! The service is great! We occupied five rooms (there was a total of 14 in my party) and had requested all five rooms to be in the Lagoon Tower from the very beginning. But at check-in the Guest Representive said we'd enjoy the Palace Tower more due to the view and the closeness to the lagoon. And she was right! We were certainly taken care of very well at the Hilton Waikoloa! The food was out of this world!! ", " I have read many reviews of this resort over the past few months. I was excited about getting there and finally seeing what it was really like. Here are the true facts about the hotel, and you can take it for what it is worth.Went there on my honeymoon for seven days at the end of October 2004.The grounds and the resort are big, but not to the point that you feel like you can't walk around and enjoy the entire property. The entire layout is absolutley gorgeous. The property is very well maintained, and the views are great.The staff was very nice, and willing to accomodate. Food was expensive, but good. The best features of the hotel were the Kohala Spa (awesome) The tennis courts, and the pools and waterfalls. Another strong point, compared to others and more expensive resorts on that coast, were the different areas around the resort to just lounge around, get some sun, or take photos. You really did not feel like you had to relax in the same area every day. Many resorts have sort of a compound feeling. This is not the case with the Hilton.Rooms were great, extremely comfortable beds. Never saw a bug for a week. By the way, birds are on this island. So, for those of you that said the birds are too loud, maybe you should have gone to a beach on the Atlantic or Pacific coasts, that does not have any trees or plants. To say that the birds there are a nuisance, is like saying that you are annoyed because when you go to a sporting event, the crowds bother you. Here is a great tip. You will be on an island! Expect to see a lot of things you don't see, or hear in Manhatten or L.A. Hello, that is why you chose an Island!You must rent a car if you are staying at any hotel on the Kohala coast. There is too much to see, too many nice beaches, and too many activities to spend your entire trip at any hotel or resort. This would be my biggest suggestion. Rent that car! A convertabile is an excellent choice.What about kids? Well, people are right, This hotel is awesome for kids (If you can afford to spend $30-$40 for dinner alone on each kid.) However, when we were there in October, there were not that many kids at all. Another must, if you do not like to be around a lot of people, go in Spetember, October, or April. We got the lowdown from some of the staff working there that in the summer, and on holidays, there are tons of families there. Also, the hotel only runs about 60% full in Sept. And Oct. so we felt like we had the whole resort to ourselves. Once again, going during peak times might be a different experience.If you can, swim with the dolphins, it is an awesome experience. The best place for lunch is the Orchid Cafe, and make sure you pick up a small cooler for the room so you have some beer, sodas, wine, etc. A good tip also is to check out what is in the mini bar, and then buy those items from the grocery store, and replace the items in the mini bar fridge as you use them. Trust me, it saved us a lot of cash.Lastly, eat at the resort once or twice, but plan to get out and try some other restaurants at other resorts, or in different areas. Cafe Pesto is a great restaurant not far from the hotel. And by the way, why are all these reviewers talking about going to Huggo's in Kona for a better priced dinner. Huggo's is just as expensive as the resort. No Huggo's!My last tip would be to check out the art work at this hotel. They have over $7 million worth of it throughout the walkways. Also, they have an excellent art gallery that is open from 10-10. The best part of the gallery is that it features only work done by local artists from the Island. They set their own prices, and have nothing to do with the hotel. There are some truly unique pieces here that you will not see any were else.In summary, comparing the rates, and what you get in return at this hotel, you really do get that best bang for your buck here. We stopped into four or five other resorts, and they were a lot more expensive and did not offer you nearly as much in terms of activities. If you want to go to a resort that is low key, and all you do is lay at the beach, then this is not the place for you. If you are like me and my wife, and like a good mix of lounging, activities, fun, excersise, relaxation and that sort of thing, then we would say definitely stay at this hotel. P.S. but not in the summer! ", " This is a fabulous hotel, and a great bargain among the top tier hotels in the islands. We stayed in early October for three nights. Upon check-in we asked the front desk for a mini fridge and they provided one free of charge (the normal fee is $6 per day). The free parking is a nice perk that many of the larger resorts in the islands no longer offer. The staff is courteous and friendly. Our room was in the ocean tower (the farthest from the entrance), which is a good half-mile or so from the front desk. The monorail and boat services are more than convenient. If you have a lot of luggage, the front desk will take it to and from your room complimentary (it will take 45 minutes for this service). The room was large and clean. Bugs are unavoidable in the tropics, even at the nicest resorts, but we found none in our room or even outside during our stay. Our garden view room was $209 per night, which isn't cheap, but when you consider many of the other 4 and 5 star hotels in Hawaii don't even offer a room for under $350, this is quite a deal. Our room had a view of the golf course and the ocean in the distance. It was very quiet, except for the birds in the late morning. Each room in our tower had a small balcony, and you can ditch the A/C and get a wonderful breeze through the screen door. The hotel grounds are magnificent. We snorkeled in the ocean fed lagoon and swam with sea turtles, eels, and all sorts of fish. The waterfall pool with water slide and the river pool are truly unique. There is a dolphin pool where for an additional fee you can set up a reservation to swim with them. There is even an adults only pool with no gimmicks to it if you want to get away from the kids running around. All pools are open 24 hours. The museum walk has some wonderful paintings and artifacts, and the wildlife on the grounds is very interesting. The drawbacks are that depending on where your room is, you can be a 20-minute walk/ride from your car. The dining options are expensive unless you do the 20-minute drive into Kailua Kona. Volcanoes Nat'l Park is a 2:30 drive away. Overall this is an amazing and unique hotel and should be experienced. ", " Hi we have just retured from the Hilton Waikoloa Village, and i must say all 15 of our party had a fantastic time. Yes i agree the hotel its self was pricey even by British standards who are used to paying over the top for everything! Myself and 11 others took part in the Dolphin encounter, the staff there were brilliant as we had two kids with us who suffer with ADHD and were very understanding. And i completely agree that putting the stuffed dolphin on the bed was a very bad idea!We did however encounter some problems with some of the staff who were'nt so thrilled about working there ie The lady who worked in the Kimo Coffee at Ocean tower had a faced like a smacked -----! Who threw your coffee at you but hey we cant all be happy! Other than that the staff were very helpful, we got a free fridge put in our room because we did'nt need the minibar,and another memeber of the party had a a rollaway bed put in for their little one again free of charge. Also at breakfast we had vouchers so adults ate free and so did our 5 year old, the seemed to forget about charging for him.Myself and my 12 year old sister did a horseback excursion through the valley, when the guide arrived he looked like something from the film deliverance, wonky eyes and bad teeth, but he was a great guy and really put us at ease.All in all a great holiday and very sad to be home to cold and grey England, and one day would love to return. ", " This place was outstanding. I was a little apprehensive after I read some of the negative reviews but after staying at this hotel, there's nothing to complain about. We were treated great, the grounds are impeccable, our room was very nice, and it doesn't really take all that long to get around.To address some of the issues I've read in other reviews:Transportation - It can take a while to get from point A to point B at this place, especially if you don't want to walk, but the walk is always breathtaking. If you are disabled or have trouble walking, you should chose another hotel for sure.Kids - There are a lot of kids at this hotel, but one can tell that it's obviously designed for families. There are very few bars, etc. for the party going crowd. My 2 year old daughter loved it and we all had a fantastic time. I did see a couple of 20 something people walking around looking sad, so just pick the place that suits your needs most. There are many families here.Expense - yes, it is expensive at the restaurants, etc, but it's a resort, it's world class, and I prefer it that way because it keeps the type of people I don't want to see on my vacation out of the hotel. No offense to the budget traveller, but when I take my family to Hawaii, I don't want the place I stay to be cheap.Big tip - Many of the things that others complain about having to pay for at this hotel are complimentary if you're a HHonors Gold or Diamond VIP, including a continental breakfast every morning.Beaches - there are several world class beaches very close by via car. One of the beaches within 10 minutes of the hotel was rated the best beach in the world. There's no shortage of quality beaches near this hotel.Distance - The only real con to this hotel is it's distance from other things. Going into Kona can be a big trip, but one should know that going in if you simply look at a map.Overall, this is a fantastic place to stay and I'd recommend it to anyone with a family or someone who wants to realx, have your own space, and just enjoy being in Hawaii. The food is great, the location is peaceful, the staff is helpful, rooms are good, and the grounds of the hotel are seriously top notch! ", " I just returned from a short stay and had a great time. The resort is massive, but I was suprised at how uncrowded it felt in the common areas (except for the Kona Pool). I was expecting a busy atmosphere, but found it peaceful and tasteful in decor. Beautiful stone and wood, and fabrics in subtle colors added to my relaxation in the common areas of the resort.I had an ocean front room in the Ocean Tower. I'd highly reccommend a room in this tower, in the front section (closest 'loop' to the ocean), as it has only the adult pool in the courtyard, so it is very quiet. In contrast the center 'loop' has the transportation and a few restraunts, so it can get noisy in the morning as people gather there.The pools were wonderful. I prefer the Kohala River Pool (it is on the Ocean Tower Side of the resort). It has a couple small waterslides, but did not get the crowd the Kona pool draws. The River Pool has several small pools, quiet places to lounge, and a great ledge for sitting on and reading. It is along the bay, with unbeatable views. Cabanas and lounges are on a first come system, and there is no charge for the use. Waitress service for lunch and drinks. The Kona Pool (at the south end of the resort)has the BIG SLIDE, a waterfall grotto that is fun to swim through and a toddler area with a wade in, sandy bottom. I think this pool can get quite crazy at busy times--good for older kids, but I wouldn't take my little ones there, it's just so overwhelming. The adult only pool is small, and in the courtyard, so no view. There is no 'coffee shop' type place to have table service and eat in. It is either a snackbar (sandwiches, quesadillas and burgers) or a fancy restaurant (all VERY good). The food isn't cheap, but I never felt ripped off, and always had friendly service. If you can get a rate that includes the breakfast buffet ($24 per adult to walk up and buy it), go for it. There are coffee stands where you can grab a cup and a muffin if that is your prefrence. You cannot eat cheap here, but you can be wise about your choices. It did get a bit 'old' waiting for the tram or boat. But if you go there expecting that and give yourself plenty of time to get from point A to point B, there should not be a problem. If you suffer knee or foot problems, be aware there are several arched bridges that have stairs, so it could be a painful walk from here to there. It is a long walk from end to end, but there is lots of wonderful art and fantastic landscaping to see along the way.I'd go back tomorrow and plant myself there for a week. I'd take the kids, and sign them up to see the dolphins. Or maybe I'd leave the kids with grandma, and go with just my husband. Either way, I'd have a great time. ", " We stayed here last June for 3 nights. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. This is a destination resort, not just a place to stay. I've read some negative comments here, but no place is perfect. Many people complain about the high price of food. We found that to be true! The cheapest place to eat was the pool side cafe, and I wouldn't exactly call that cheap! It closed in the evening, focring you into their high-priced restaurants. However, we usually weren't in the hotel area in the evenings anyways, usually out and about sight seeing. Our first evening we arrived about 5 pm, hungry and tired. We took one look at the prices of the restaurants in the resort and cleared out. We drove into Kona and had a very good meal with an ocean view at Michaelangelo's. We used a coupon from our Entertainment book and the whole thing came to about $60 for four people! However, it was a major inconvenience to have to drive so far for a meal. We got a fridge for the room and stocked up on milk, cereal, coffee fixings, etc. at the local WalMart (again, an inconvenient drive off the property). We saved a bundle doing breakfast in our room. I've read several complaints about the noisy birds, however, we didn't have any such problem. Must be where we stayed--the Palace Tower. We went \"on the cheap\", got the AAA rate of $179 per night. For that, we got the \"poor man's view\", aka garden view. The view was fantastic! No ocean view, but a beautiful view of the grounds (no parking lots). The room was great with the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in! Quiet, too! We definitely want to go back and spend more time here. Just be sure to get the Palace Tower and you won't be bothered with the birds. Also, remember you need to eat off property or you can easily double your total bill. Otherwise, this is a fantastice place and not to be missed! ", " Great hotel for a family vacation. Real fun for kids. The Palace Tower section was wonderful. The food/service at the Kirin Chinese Restaurant was average the most (unjustifiably overpriced).Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and felt that we got a great value for what we paid. ", " We stayed at the Waikoloa Village on our honeymoon. ITS THE BEST. If people think that its too expensive, then why are they going to Hawaii anyways? Everyone was responsive. We stayed in the Garden Tower facing the golf course and ocean. It was great. The roomservice is great, the food was great. We had no problem parking our rental car and walking. It does not take an hour to get to your room. They have a wonderful tram that goes constantly back and forth between all the towers. Really the only time you need to leave is to go sight seeing on the island, but the rest of the time you can chill by the lagoon or the pool. It has beautiful views of the ocean and of the sunsets. That is the only place I will stay on the Big Island. ITS GREAT!!! ", " Aloha! I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for six days the second week of June for my niece's wedding (she was married in their beautiful little chapel overlooking the ocean - - so romantic!). Our room in the Ocean tower was very comfortable and well maintained. If you're on a budget, bring your own coffee and snacks and keep them in the room's refrigerator. Also, King's Village (a short ride on the shuttle from the hotel lobby) offers several restaurants, a food court, small market and some fun shopping too!. (In the early evening they had Hawaiian entertainment which was enjoyable!). Of course, the hotel offers many fine restaurants as noted in the other reviews. You'll definitely want to go swimming and there are several beautiful pools to choose from depending on if you want to be around lots of children (near Lagoon towers) or a bit quieter (around the Ocean towers). Even though there are very few \"beaches\" on this island (think \"volcano\"), you still have access to the shoreline -- just be careful slipping and sliding on the rocks!.We spent a couple hours watching families swim with the dolphins (very expensive and you need to reserve WELL in advance), but it doesn't cost a penny to sit back and watch the fun! It was also very enjoyable just strolling around the hotel grounds and soaking up the spectacular scenery; or there's a tram and boat ride to take you from one location to another. I never thought I'd enjoy staying at a Resort thinking it would be \"too restrictive or boring\" but this one changed my mind! Bring your camera as all my pictures look like postcards! This entire resort looks \"like a Kodak moment\"! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa is a terrific hotel. It is like going to Disneyland. The place is massive. The pools are incredible and the amenities are fantastic. The only drawbacks is that the restaurants are quite expensive and the tram service leaves a lot to be desired. However, we are planning on going back there next year. ", " We just returned from our third visit to this hotel. It was great. We were in the lagoon tower with an ocean view and a great view of the dolphin pool. Entire facility was clean and the service was great.There were 7 of us in three different rooms and they were all great. Prices were about what you expect from a resort area. They could use another lounge area like the Boat Landing on the lagoon side of the resort. ", " I just got back from staying at this hotel, and I miss it already. :(I was very worried after reading the various reviews on this sight, but my fears were unfounded after staying at this absolutely WONDERFUL hotel.When you walk around the hotel you will see the most beautiful ocean sights and lagoon sights. It's honestly pure paradise and is worth every single penny to stay at this hotel. I'm not kidding and I'm picky.HOTEL ROOM: I stayed in the Palace Tower and had a very clean and LARGE room with a king size bed in it. I liked the Palace tower because it was right between the good pools on one side and the restaurants on the other. No cigarette smoke could be smelled or anything. Great room, although we never spent much time in it.RESTAURANTS: We ate at nearly all the restaurants at the hotel and had room service. The room service is quite slow, but the food is pretty good (not as good as at the restaurants though). DONATONI's had wonderful Italian food and a nice selection of wine. IMARI's was a fabulous Japanese restaurant where we had tepeyaki. This was particularly nice since I'm a vegetarian and they prepared my meal first and had a great selection of vegetables and the sauces were dreamy. Please remember that these are expensive restaurants, but nothing is that cheap in Hawaii anyway.SPA: I had a lomi lomi massage that was an hour long of pure bliss. It was worth the $120 I spent that's for sure. I have never felt so relaxed in my life. Plus, with any spa treatment you are allowed to use their facilities which include a great steam room, sauna and beautifully landscaped whirlpool. I definitely recommend this.GIFT SHOPS: Go to the King's Shop for the best souveniers, the hotel's selection is not the best.TRANSPORTATION: Cabs to and from the hotel are easy to come by (cost is $42 one way). Transportaion in the hotel via the trams and boats run regularly and are easy to find. They were very quick to and from and I never had to wait more than 4 minutes for transportation. After staying at the resort a few days, it was nice just to WALK everywhere since the hotel isn't as large and exhausting as people on this website make it out to be. FYI, if you want a rental car, book one before you get there. If you wait to rent one at the hotel they are usually rented out and you will have to take a cab back to the airport and then rent one that is usually a luxury car. That's what happened to us.POOLS: My favorite pool is the one by the Lagoon tower with the waterfalls. It is a lot of fun and such a nice place to relax with the pool bar right next to the pool where I had a wonderful Lavaflow drink that I highly recommend. I did notice that one day the pool was a little dirty at the end of the day because of leaves falling in the pool after a heavy wind and rain storm, but that is to be expected.DOLPHINS: I registered 2 months ahead of time at the Dolphin Quest website for the Adult Dolphin Encounter and I'm so glad. Reserve your spot early before you go! I was in heaven when I went into the water with 4 dolphins and 2 baby dolphins which were great. Please e-mail me with any questions you may have about this.I loved this hotel and wouldn't mind answering any questions you may have at prudiebel@hotmail.com. Thanks. ", " Our family (myself, husband, 3 and 6yr old) just stayed for 7 days in the Lagoon Tower on the 4th floor overlooking the fish and baracudas. In fact, we took a red eye flight back to LAX last night 7/16. Thanks to all the reviews on this site we knew to stay in the Lagoon Tower, that the food would be expensive and everything else to expect! Well, our room was fantastic, we booked on Expedia and requested the Lagoon Tower upon arrival and after the front desk made some calls, we got it! From our room we could see the ocean from a distance and the mountains. Since I knew to expect an in room coffee charge, I brought a little two cup electric tea kettle and some coffee bags and tea bags with me. I also brought a small Brita and plastic cups to save on bottled water charges. Also, there is a great general store at The Kings Shops and we bought donuts, bagels, cereal cups, milk, cream cheese, a block of cheese, apple juice, peanut butter, bread, etc. to keep in the room. In the closet there was a wooden organizer to hold all the food and a decent sized small refrigerator, it worked out perfect! Also, the kids menu on room service was alot less expensive and we would order off that too. There is also a Wal-Mart in Kona if you want to stock up on food or snorkeling gear, sand toys, etc. which we did also.The grounds were absolutely amazingly beautiful. We enjoyed the lagoon pool, and we loved the lagoon to play and snorkel in. And we had a great server bring us lunch and tropical drinks at the lagoon, but no offers at the pool, but the pool bar is very close and convenient to grab a mai tai or virgin drink and a snack at! I recommend snorkeling in the lagoon and going outside the rope out into the ocean cove under the bridge. The water was sparkling clear, a ton of fish, eels and I had an amazing experience coming face to face with a green sea turtle and swimming along with it for a long time as it headed back into the lagoon area. It was one of the most surreal and beautiful moments I will always remember! My husband got two underwater cameras shot in the cove outside the lagoon, and it is not a far swim at all.We took the tram and boat for fun since the kids liked it, but we never needed to use it since the Lagoon Tower is close to everything. We ate at the Lagoon Cafe and it was ok, quite expensive for hamburgers (60$ for 4), and the Kamuela Provision Company located over the Lagoon Pool, which I loved since we saw the sunset and you can sit out on the patio with tiki torches and a beautiful view of the ocean. The food there was pretty good, I had a filet and husband had seafood, it was about $135. Lets all face it though, all the island foods are ridiculously expensive no matter where you are!!!My best tip for anyone is the food court at the Kings Shops if you have kids or picky kids like we do. There is a great place that serves breakfast plates all day, croissant sandwiches, bagels, and coffee and had a great looking bbq chicken plate that came with rice and caesar salad for $5.95. Then there is a pizza and chinese food place, a dairy queen and a mexican food place with great quesadillas served with chips and guac and sour cream for $5, also a fish and chips place too, and a subway. Not too shabby and we spent a little less than $30 to feed a family of four there. We sat outside and watched thousands of fish in the pond each time we ate.Our favorite restaurant in Kona is Huggo's, and we ate at the smaller Huggo's on the Rocks right next door since we had the kids and they have the best Kona Mud Pie and great sandwiches and appetizers, we also watched a sea turtle swim in front of us the whole time. They had markers and coloring books for the kids too, it was a great lunch. Kona was alot busier than the last time we were there 8 years ago for our honeymoon, so I was really happy we stayed in Waikoloa Village away from the craziness. There is fast food Mcdonalds, Taco Bell and Burger King in Kona too. It was a 20 minute drive from the resort.The best things about the resort are all the things you can do, the pools, the lagoon, the dolphin lagoon, and looking at our video and some of the pics, they came out post card perfect, the Hilton is truly beautiful, especially with all the japanese statues that look great with crystal green ocean behind them. At night time it is fun, tiki torches everywhere and a big waterfall in front of the lobby you can walk behind. If you have kids this is the resort to stay at, but do your research like we did to ensure a great trip. For honeymooners or couples, I'd recommend the Mauna Lani to stay at and just visit the grounds for a day, this is truly a family resort destination. There are kids everywhere, so we felt right at home! And we did request late check out and received it until 2pm which was perfect. All the staff was so nice, I really think if you are nice and sweet to them, they really go out of their way for you. I also recommend having a car rental and using the valet, it is just a few dollars more ($10.50 all day) to valet and so much more convenient than walking to the lot. All and all, a perfect vacation for this CA family, I wish I was still there!!!!! Also, we flew United and I was amazed at how great they took care of the kids in coach, and the pilot was great and the ride smooth both ways. One more tip, the car rentals are far away in the Kona airport, and you need to take the shuttle, they carry your bags on and it is air conditioned so that was great.The shops at The Lagoon Tower are also fantastic, gift shops to ritzy shops, a moms shopping heaven, and the Kings Shops had great stuff and so did the General Store that you get food at.hope this helps, One happy mom who glided with a beautiful sea turtle at the VillageIf you have any questions, feel free to email me at caseylsmith@yahoo.com ", " my wife and i visited for the second time this june.we stayed in the lagoon tower and highly recommend both the resort and that tower.we checked out by phone,it worked great and did not take 60 seconds.the lagoon tower is near a canal boat turn around and a few handy shops.there are lots of tropical fish in this end of the canal and you get great views of the schools of barracuda,some of them more than four feet long.our room had been rennovated,along with the entire tower, and looked like new.it had very premium bedding.the room was entirely remodeled,carpet, wall coverings,all new furniture and all new fixtures everything.there is a minibar and a seperate serving bar.there was no charge for the fridge as wrongly reported .the room was very new and very luxurious.new sheets,shams.spread,pillows etc. there are lots of things to do.how do you like your hot tub,with or without waterfall,there is one of each.we received complimentary fruit bowls twice.all this in a standard room.our view gave us the ocean and mountains in the background.we did see many turtles in the bay along with lots of fish.the change in water color some people report is from changing tides and not from \"excessive suntan oil\" as others have suggested,very natural occurance.all of the room lotions were nutragena brand and were fully restocked every day.it is a big resort,but easy to get around in and very beautiful and well kept.the art in the walkways and all over the resort is beautiful and interesting.it is a resort , not a motel or hotel,everything you need is there.hawaii is the largest island in the chain and driving from one side to the other takes a long time no matter where you stay.hawaii is a volcanic island,there are very few sand beachs,i enjoy the lava beachs just as much,easy to walk on and no sand in your shoes and clothes or shower.dont forget to visit the lava beach over by the spa,its great,lots of warm tide pools.we like this resort a lot,its beautiful,the staff is pleasant.kona is only 15 minutes away. go and enjoy the hilton.we have and will return again.if you have any questions i will be glad to try and answer them .dan ", " We stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa from May 30 - June 6 and loved every minute of it! It is the nicest resort we have ever stayed at. I had been reading the reviews for several months and didn't know what to expect, but we have no complaints at all. The Hilton is beautiful, the service was fine, and my 11 year old son had a great time in the lagoon swimming with the turtles and even had the puffer fish eating out of his hand. The highlight for him was swimming with the dolphins. Shannon, the waitress working the lagoon area, took great care of us all week with our food/drink orders. We did have our own cooler for water, etc. We stayed in the Palace Tower which is in the middle, and yes, you do a lot of walking, but we didn't mind the exercise and the grounds are just beautiful. I like my pool water on the warm side and didn't find the water at the Hilton to be too cold, either. I truly don't understand the negative reviews......this is a great place for a family vacation, and we would not hesitate staying there again. You can contact me with any questions. ", " What a fabulous trip to the Hilton Waikoloa Village! This place is absolutely fantastic -- a real tropical oasis. When we walked into the lobby, my son said, \"I feel like we're rich.\" My sister thought we belonged on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. I cannot say enough about how terrific this hotel was. The rooms were super clean, the staff friendly, the pools exciting, the lagoon neat, etc... Snorkeling in the lagoon was fabulous -- I came face to face with a giant sea turtle. The pools are fun, too. We liked the Kohala pool (at the ocean tower) better than the one at the Lagoon Tower. The Lagoon tower's pool was more crowded (although there was still lots of room) and the water was colder. They did have a better waterslide, but you can't have it all! This place is the perfect place to relax -- so peaceful and beautiful.The only real negative is the high price of food and drinks. That can be easily solved by a trip to the Safeway in Kona and an in-room refrigerator or cheap cooler. We saw plenty of people who brought their own coolers to the beach, and we always ate breakfast in our room (Safeway donuts.) Get a car, and drive into Kona for dinner, which will be much cheaper than the resort or a restaurant at the Kings Shops.I had read all the reviews on this site, and there are 2 complaints I want to address. First, I was a little worried about the size of the resort, because so many people have reported that it's difficult to get around. None of the people in my party are great athletes, but we were all able to make the walk to the pools, lobby, restaurants, etc... The monorail and the boat come by often, although I'd advise you to walk it if you're in a hurry. The second complaint I've read on this hotel is that there are too many kids. We met a couple that checked out of the Hilton because there were \"too many kids.\" I'll bet there were just as many kids at the Marriott! If you don't want to be around kids, go to a Sandals Resort! Hello, are we supposed to sequester ourselves to Disney World or Universal Studios until our kids graduate from high school? Get a grip, kids are everywhere!In short, I will go back to this hotel again and again. We stayed in the Palace tower this time, but next time I would like to try the Lagoon or Ocean towers since they have pools attached. ", " If you like Gondalas that take you to the building your room is, beautiful swimming areas, waterfalls and dolphins on site then this hotel is for you! I don't know what some of the complainers are talking about! We had the best beef teriyaki at the restaurant that has a buffet overlooking the swan pond. Yes it is expensive but all 5 star hotels in Hawaii are expensive. Also, for those of you that don't like a family environment this hotel is not for you. Another issue might be that there isn't a beach. The Big Island \"Hawaii\" is mostly lava! So, expect this if you choose to stay there. If you want beaches do Maui, Oahu, or Kaui. This hotel is truly marvelous! Enjoy! ", " I read a lot of reviews on this place before I left so I was prepared. I vowed I would write my own review so other people would have as amazing a time as we did. This place is trully like Disneyland. We stayed in the Palace Towers from 5/9/04-5/16/04. Our room was beautiful and the maid service was very good. Our view was the golf course, beautiful. We had free breakfast which was was at the Palm Terrace. We had a 25$ buffet every day while we sat next to the wildlife pond with beautiful fish and birds. It is true that things are a bit of a walk to get to but I enjoyed that because everywhere you walk is a piece of art, a pond, a buda, a flower, a walkway. The place is amazing and I never tired of walking around. We spent most of our time at the Kona Pool with its amazing waterfalls and waterslide. We went snorkeling in the Lagoon and I saw turtles each time I went. The food is average price (remember you are on an island where everything cost more.) But we went to Costco in Kona when we landed and stocked up on beer, water, and snacks. We asked and were provided with a fridge in our room (no extra cost) and we were all set. Bring a beach bag or cooler with wheels because once you head for the pool for the day you don't want to go back to your room. I also did the Dolphin Quest adult program which was worth every penny. We don't have kids but there were tons of little ones there and they seemed to be loving it. The pool is cold. I brought a swimming jacket and lots of people were wearing surf shirts. Also bring water shoes for the pool b/c it is rought on the bottom. I am happy to answer anyones specific questions. ", " I can understand how a lot of people who go to this hotel can be overwhelmed by a lot that goes on there. First, yep.....be prepared, there are kids. The primary reason for this is that this hotel offers more things for families to do than any other hotel in the area. It's true, it's like a Disneyland for kids. The rooms are very large, lots of connecting rooms, great pools and slides, and economical food and bedding options. Second,....there are a lot of tourists from Japan. This hotel caters to tour groups from Japan and it's large enough to have several of them at one time. Third....it's a resort destination that can handle groups or conventions, but they aren't in a way that hampers your stay.Fourth.....IT'S MASSIVE, but depending on where you request your room to be and what your ideal vacation needs to be, you can position yourself where it's not such a big deal. There are several shortcuts you can take to the area you need to go. You just need to ask the concierge the best route to take, rather than figuring it out on your own. All of the towers have concierges that are available at ground level at an area where you walk right by them, so take the time and ask for help.We have stayed at nearly all the hotels on the Big Island, and we find that this one offers the best of everything for the price. Get over the fact that it's so large.....it's easy to drive up, valet your car, get on the tram and get to your room.We stayed at Hapuna on the same trip and it took us just as long to get to our room there as it did to the Palace Tower at the Hilton.I agree that the price of the food here is a little pricey, but it's a lot cheaper than the other hotels in the area. They have restaurants available for the families to do sit down dining, but they have also realized that families or couples can come in on a budget and get food to go at various locations and eat in a cafe setting that is very good.There is a buzz around the Hilton Waikoloa that you won't fine anywhere else....and the buzz is activity. It's not a loud hotel at all, but it's always moving with people. Other than the Four Seasons, I believe the Hilton offers some of the best breezes you'll find on a Hawaii property. The pools are ideal, and they offer an adult only pool at the Ocean Tower, so.....if you're a couple, and you're looking for some 1 on 1 time, request the Ocean Tower and inform them you are adults looking for some quiet time....they'll accomadate you. If you're a family, I believe the best tower is the Lagoon Tower, which is near the sand pool area. The Ocean Tower is also a good location as well, but the Lagoon Tower will get you closer to the workout area and spa and the front desk.The spa at the Hilton is no Four Seasons, but it's good enough. The work out area is marginal at best, but the trails around the property are more fun to run that inside anyway.I love the valet. When we arrived this most recent trip, we were greeted by Shawn. YOu'll know him when you see him.....He's a dashing 6'6\" man that wears a hawaiian wrap and has a great smile to greet you when you arrive and leave. He remembered me from our visit a year ago and asked 'what's it been, a year, 2?' 'where are the kids?' That's special.Check in can be a little chaotic, especially when you're coming in around 12-3pm, but your room is usually ready.There are some things I'm not happy about. The service around the Dolphin Lagoon pool restaurant is shabby, but the bartending is FANTASTIC. If you're a couple, sit at the bar.Service at the Ocean Tower cafe offers sushi, casual dining, and a bar. We enjoyed this area a lot.Service around the pool is horrible as well. You're going to have to get up and get your own food and drink. It shouldn't be this way, but it is.The bathrooms are small, except for the suites, and I don't like the bathroom amenities. They've gotten cheap when they used to provide Kohala Spa amenities.If you have kids, this is the place, if you don't you can still enjoy yourself and save some $$ ", " The hotels don't have beaches in Big Island regardless of how much you pay, they are Oceanfront, but it's impossible to have their own beach because of the huge rocks, if you planning to visit Hawaii because you love the beach, visit Kauai or Maui, they have the most beautiful beaches. Big Island it's beautiful, but do not pay $500. or $600. in hotel thinking you will get a beach. All the hotels in Big Island have lagoons, they are fed from the ocean. The Hilton lagoon it's beautiful, you can snorkel and you can swim as well to the ocean, it's amazing how many beautiful colorful fishes you can see.Hope you enjoy too!! ", " This was the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in! I would highly recommend it to both families and couples. I actually went there with my mother and we had a wonderful time.The grounds are lush and stunning, with a lagoon for snorkeling and the pools were lovely. I especially enjoyed the casual dining right outside my door. It was kind of like a food court and they had wonderful sushi rolls!Yes, the restaurants are very pricy, but the food was stellar. The only complaint would be that cocktails around the pool bars did not have much alcohol in them for the price. ", " Anyone who has not shared in the experience and excellence should really go to the magnificant place. I truly loved the rooms, ammedities, pools, people who worked there from the top to the bottom this was the most elegant place I have ever seen. Not only do the Parents enjoy it but the so do the kids they have every activity known so that everyone enjoys this trip. ", " This is a wonderful place. So beautiful. One of the best family resorts I have stayed at. It is large, but easy to get around. The staff was very nice. The kids day camp is wonderful both of my children loved it. Can't think of a better place to bring a family on vaction. ", " This was our second trip to the Hilton and it was just as good as our first time 2 years ago. We stayed 7 nights on the top floor of the Lagoon Tower (helps sometimes to be a smoker!) and had a nice big room with 27\" TV, large bathroom with tub/shower, 2 double beds, loveseat, mini-fridge and mini-bar. There were 4 of us (3 adults and 1 child) and we never felt cramped.Very little has changed in the past 2 years. A lounge with nightly live entertainment has been added near the lobby and that's about it. The grounds are beautiful and large pools, hot tubs and lagoon provide hours and days of enjoyment.The pool may not be the warmest but it is heated (I could feel warm water at an inlet) and was plenty warm enough for me and the lagoon is a great place for safe ocean fun for children and adults alike. Seemed like everyone was having a great time to me.I can't comment on the restraunts except to say that they are quite expensive and we usually just took the trolly over to the King's Shops and ate there for a fraction of the price. Even Roy's is less expensive than the food at the Hilton.The Hilton is a great resort for families but I would not recommend it nearly as highly to couples. ", " We returned last night after 11 days at this beautiful resort. It was a wonderful experience. Upon check-in we were upgraded from a Garden View room to Oceanfront - looking right out on \"Budda Point\" in the Ocean Tower and from our patio we could see the 12th hold of the King's Golf course AND the ocean - and the Humpback Whales would give us a show every morning and evening! The lagoon is a fabulous place for the kids to play in the sand & us adults to snorkle and lay in the sun (cocktails in hand!). This time of year the tradewinds kick up in the afternoon, so any other beach may be too rough for young kids to wade in and too windy to enjoy a good book; making this wind-protected lagoon a terrific option. Did I mention all the sea turtles that are swimming around in the lagoon? The pools are beautiful but they aren't heated. They are pretty cold upon entry, but you acclimate to it and then it's fine. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL, and there are plenty of hammocks & cabana chairs to watch sunsets and whales from. The restaurants are expensive, but I definitely recommend a splurge at the Kamuela Provision Company at sunset on the patio - great food, live music, incredible views. Our ONLY complaint is how long it takes to get anywhere in the resort. It took us about 15 min. to walk from our room to the lobby (and another 5 min. to get to the car from there). BUT, we didn't mind the exercise with all the junk we ate on our trip, and we quickly learned to plan our days to allow for the walk. The tram & boats are a great option, when they are available. Our kids LOVED riding on these (remember to watch for the barracuda in the water when riding the boats). Kids camp & nanny services worked well for our young ones as well. It was nice to go to dinner and have some \"adults-only\" time at the resort while the kids were having fun at camp. The rooms were comfortable, but maybe a bit worn & outdated. However, everything else about this resort was terrific - and who spends that much time in the room? There was also a handy laundry room to wash our clothes mid-week - $2 to wash & dry a load. All in all, we would definitely stay at this resort again - especially if we are travelling with kids!! ", " We were at the hotel with our two kids (4 year old and a 7 month old). We spent 7 nights and LOVED our stay! At the end of our trip, we felt like we could spend a couple of additional days there - not something that we'd say about all of the resorts we've been to. The lagoon makes for wonderful water activities for the children and the grounds are gorgeous. The resturants were expensive and the food was not what we'd expect. However, the Orchid Cafe had good food and generous portions. For dining, you could go to the Kings Shops. The Merryman Cafe is definitely the best there. Grab an icecream at the general store at Kings Shops and enjoy a free hula show. One more thing - the rooms in the Lagoon Tower are refurbished so the rooms are clean and new. Request the Lagoon Tower!!! The Lagoon Tower is also the closest to the lobby/parking so it's a bit more convenient to getting around. We usually took a nice, leisurely trip around the hotel in the boat before turning in for the night. And the staff were definitely cheerful and helpful. :) ", " Witnessed dolphin programs for 3 days in January, 2004. Daughter was a participant at the Kohala Mandarin Dolphin Quest in Oahu also in January and in my opinion the Dolphin Quest program at the Hilton was far superior to the one in Oahu. Our experience was extremely disappointing and to date the general manager has not even responded to out complaints/suggestions. ", " We stayed at the Hilton four nights, including New Years' Eve, last week. My three teen-age children and one of their friends accompanied my wife on this vacation. Our rooms were in the Ocean Tower. We couldn't get upgraded due to the number of guests, but we provided conceirge floor access nonetheless. This was a great cost saver as we had our breakfasts here. The previous reviews appear to fairly represent the Hilton. The grounds are immaculate; the distance from Ocean Tower to the Lobby and to parking is about 3/4 mile and 1 mile, respectively. If you are disabled or don't like exercise, get a room at the Lagoon or Palace Towers.We ate dinners at the Kamuela Provision Company( Seafood and Steak), Kirin (Chinese), and Donatoni (Italian). All these were excellent. The winelist at Kamuela was fine, not extensive, but adequate. The lambchops were well prepared as were appetizers and fish dishes. Service was superior. We did carryout at Kirin and everyone loved the food. Orange Chicken, MooShu Pork, General Tso's Chicken and the Curried Noodles are worth a try. Our New Year's Eve dinner at Donatoni was delightful. The setting is well described in the guidebooks (romantic). The food was excellent and the service good. The wine list here was good, but for the type of establishment, I would have liked more choices, especially from California.The service was good. Yes, there were one or tow surly employees, but most of the staff were kind and willing to assist us.The bellhops or whatever they are were great. We had our bags delivered to our room shortly upon arrival and they were prompt in getting our bags to the lobby upon departure.If you like to walk or jog, there are some fun spots along the main road leading up to the hotel. You can walk to the King's Shops, which is just a half mile away. We enjoyed walking around these shops. The general store here is good for souvenirs, especially kona coffee and macademina nuts. And, while the prices were high, they have some fine California wines available for purchase.Our garden view rooms were fine. As described in other reviews, they are not huge, but they easily accomodate three people (even four, considering how little time you will spend in them).The hotel is about 25 minutes from the airport; about 25 minutes from Waimea, and about 1 and half hours from Hilo (2 hours to the volcanoes). A nice place for lunch near the airport is the Harbor House. They have wonderful scooners of beer and good fish sandwiches. The place is on the bay overlooking the marina. It's a locals place for the most part. This is a good spot for lunch following a snorkeling trip to Keokaloke Bay.We did the dolphin adventure. The kids will always remember it. It's only a half hour and very expensive.If you want a place that has outstanding places to sun and rest, this is your hotel. If you want to eat in a variety of fine restaurants, this too is your hotel. But, if you want an intimate cozy spot with few people and fewer young adults, you may want to consider other options. If just my wife and I had made this trip, I'd still be writing this review and giving you the same high marks. It's that nice of place. ", " This was a totally awsome trip. For one thing it was free in the fact that I won this trip through a local radio station. Didn't know what to expect especially since I had read quite a few unsatisfactory reviews on this resort. It was totally awesome. I don't know where the unsatisfactory reviews were staying but it couldn't have been the Hilton Waikoloa Village. This was a totaly beautiful resort and the staff were very gracious with us. They were very helpful in every way. We would never have been able to stay at this resort if I had not won this trip. It was something to just see if you can't stay there. It was at a very slow time of year so there was not much going on but it was great. The restaurants were a little pricey but you could always eat somewhere else. It was geared towards families but this was OK too. We had a family at one time and it was fine. I would highly recommend going to this resort if you can afford it. ", " My husband and I recently returned from an amazing trip to the Hilton Waikoloa. Our visit there was from were October 9-15, 2003. Prior to leaving, I had read several posts on this site about the property and had essentially prepared myself for something less than we had hoped for when we made the reservations. All this was immediately wiped out when we got to the hotel, however. Upon pulling up to the drive, the valet openned my door with a very warm \"Aloha! Welcome to the Hilton Waikoloa!\" which immediately put a smile on my face. We valeted the car this time and had them go ahead and bring the luggage up to our room, as we had heard that it could be quite a trek, depending on where your room was located. There was really no one in the lobby at this time (around 12 pm local time) however there were 5 people at the front desk for check in. As Hilton Honors Gold members, we went to the HHonors check in line. The woman there was VERY pleasant and upon our showing her our gold card and Hilton Honors points redemption voucher for the room (6 free nights) she immediately said she'd look for an upgraded room. After a couple of minutes she said the only ocean view room she had was on a smoking floor. My husband and I enjoy the occasional cigar, but usually prefer non-smoking rooms. So we were a little leery. My husband asked if it was worth it, to which an immediate \"Oh, yes!\" came forth. So we decided to chance it, thinking if it smelled too bad we'd just go get a bottle of Fabreeze and soak the place. Hilton was also offering an opportunity for a free upgrade to Diamond ammenities, so the woman gave us the executive level keys for the free continental breakfast and free sodas with the and afternoon appetizers. (which turned out to be a godsend -- cans of coke in the mini bar and all around the property were $3 a pop! Tip to the wise and lucky with this ammenity -- go ahead and drink the cold coke in your mini bar -- just replace it the free soda you get all afternoon from the executive lounge before housecoming comes back! Take 3 or more each time you go up so you don't have to continue making the trek back to the lounge. A couple of times we thought we'd have to pay for the cokes as we drank them late at night and didn't have the foresight to have brought replacements back from the lounge. We were lucky and were never charged, however. We just made sure it was refilled each day and before we left.) With the \"happy hour\" the have an honor bar with fairly normal prices. Two Coronas cost us about $8.00 which isn't any worse than most places off property.Took the boat ride to the room and enjoyed soaking up the views of art, lush greenery and flowers. When we got to the ocean tower, we departed and set out to find out room, mostly in awe of the place already. Much to our delight we discovered a cute little outdoor bar/deli/sushi place within stumbling distance of our room. We were on the 4th floor with a GORGEOUS view of one of the many pools and the ocean. We found the room to be quite nice and very similar to other Hilton rooms we have stayed at in the past, although the only time we really spent in it was to sleep! We discovered much to our surprise that the small loveseat converted into a pull out bed which was GREAT since my dear friend that lives in Maui was able to come stay with us for a couple of days.To those that complained to was too big to get around, I wonder if you have the same complaint at Disney World, for this resort is the Hawaiian equivalent. The Hilton Waikoloa is not set up to be a small resort with quick entrances and exits. It is meant to be enjoyed in Hawaiian style where the pace is slower and you enjoy smelling the flora which is abundantly around you. That's why you have slow boat rides around the property. You're on vacation!! RELAX!! I agree that the food was expensive there - we had the breakfast buffet one day and it was $54.00. Remember, EVERYTHING in Hawaii is expensive, but some of the reviewers were right when they said you could do better elsewhere. We had a great guidebook that was right on the money with restaurant reviews. I would HIGHLY recommend everyone that goes there to make this valuable purchase. It's called \"The Big Island, Revealed.\" It was worth it's weight in gold, plus some.We never ran into any problems with the staff, although on occasion we witnessed the staff being treated VERY poorly by guests. Apparently there are a few of vacationers out there that feel the best way to get something you don't deserve is to complain as loudly as possible and berate whomever you speak to. On more than one occasion it was clear the guest was out of line, but Hilton tried their best to rectify the problem. They did charge us for valet for each day of our stay, but we just told the front desk clerk it was a mistake, we had only used the valet twice and they immediately credited the account. Much to our surprise, the free room was indeed free - we didn't have to pay taxes OR surcharges of any type, only the charges that we signed for on the property.The bar located in the middle of the ocean tower had entertainment in the form of a solo guitarist who played the Hawaiian take on popular tunes...quite enjoyable. There were never many people there and the singer always stayed until at least 10:30 or later. Most nights we left before he did, around 11. The tiki bar at the main pool makes a mean mai tai and wonderful margarita. Again, not cheap, but not the most expensive we encountered on the island either.Anyway, our trip was delightful and exactly how we envisioned it after researching the area and the resort. Of all the vacations we have taken, this was surely our favorite, made so in part by Hilton.Mahalo! ", " The Hilton Waikoloa was wonderful! After 8 days we did not want to leave. I read many poor reviews prior to going, so there was great concern for our vacation, however, our vacation was great. With that said, this hotel is probably not for everyone. If you want a quiet, small property with a quick entrance and exit, or a property without children, this is not the place for you. You get around by walking, boat or tram. It's a huge property, which can be a drawback for some, but is also it's great appeal for others - like us. We have a 10 and 7 year old and all four of us loved the property. We loved the long walks everywhere - especially at night, when you could walk from the Ocean Tower to the Lagoon Tower, with Tiki Torches lighting your way. Every walk had new discoveries (turtles and colorful fish in the lagoon, artwork everywhere, lots of marble statues, and the children loved finding which Chinese \"Year of\" statue they were born in. There were huge (I think marble?) statues of \"Year of the Pig, Year of the Monkey, Year of the Dragon\", etc. - set around the Ocean Tower). I asked if we could be upgraded to an Ocean View and we were, very graciously, which was a tremendous treat (the front desk staff, as well as all staff were friendly and wonderful all week). We heard this was low season, so the upgrade may have been more available due to this and also we are Gold VIP members. We had friends who were on the ground floor with a garden view, which was also very nice. I don't think there is a bad view at this hotel. The property is about 20-30 minutes to Kona. Again, for some this is a drawback, but for us, we enjoyed the drive. Had dinner once at Huggo's On the Rocks in Kona and it was very enjoyable - would highly recommend. There are two Huggo's restaurants - both on the water, one nicer and the other was outdoors with a bar, sand floor, tiki torches, live music (there was a solo guitarist/singer there while we ate an early dinner), and casual but good food. The rooms at Waikoloa were dated, but I heard from another guest that her daughter was in the Lagoon Tower with a remodeled room and it was nice. She was told they will do Palace Tower next then Ocean Tower. We loved the Ocean Tower as it was near Budda Point (a wonderful lookout), near the putting green and near several pools. We never minded the distance, but it is the furtherest one to walk to. The Palace Tower seemed to be the quietest, with no pools around it. The Lagoon Tower was where most of the activity was - the large water slide (there are 4 total on the property), several water falls into the large pools, a water basketball hoop, volleyball net, sand pool, exercise water programs, two spa's with falls and one or two more spas without falls. Lots of water activity near the Lagoon Tower. Also, a full bar and a casual restaurant. The Ocean Tower pools are quieter (although the other 3 smaller slides are there). There is no restaurant nearby, although there was an occassional bar attendant to take drink orders. The Lagoon was a highlight for the kids. It was a safe snorkeling environment and they saw turtles, eels, lots of colorful fish. and loved swimming out to the waterfalls across the lagoon. Lots of water toys to rent, if you desire (kayak's, boogie boards, etc.). There is an attendant who takes lunch and drink orders throughout the day at the Lagoon also. Two baby dolphins were born the week we were on-site. We didn't do the Dolphin Quest, but they were adorable to watch. I wish they had a much larger area for the dolphins, it seemed too small for the animals. Three other items of interest - first, there are Petrogliffs (sp?) near the Hilton. Park at the Shell gas station in the King's Shops down the street from Hilton and follow the signs. It can be a short 10 minute walk, or you can spend an hour there. Another fun spot is if you take the walking path on the ocean side of the Lagoon Tower, going up to the restaurant, there is a rocky beach access path to the right. Wear sturdy shoes, but this is a great place for tidepools. Last, Akaka Falls near Hilo is wonderful. Yes, it's a 1 1/2 to 2 hour drive to them, but this was a highlight. The walk is paved (it is probably 20-30 minutes with short stops at the falls), there are 2 falls and the most beautiful rain forest gardens I've ever seen. We didn't go to the Botanical Gardens ($15pp) which is just down the street, but our friends enjoyed these also. Take light rain gear. It rained both times we were in Hilo and we heard it rains there daily. The American Express Travel Center at the Hilton told us about Akaka Falls and was a big help in helping us get maps and plan our week for activities we would enjoy, I would highly recommend you visit them your first day to see what's available. They also booked our Luau and our friends' helicopter ride over Volcano National Park. Overall, we'd definitely come back to the Hilton Waikaloa and look forward to the remodeled rooms! ", " This Hilton Village was amazing. This is the hotel that even many of the guests at the neighboring hotels come to...to see the grounds and experience this marvelous architectural splendor and adventurous surroundings. \"It is all that.\"When you arrive........just give in to it.... let the staff help you find your room and way and don't fight the attempt for the hotel to provide a great experience to you and your family, although you probably don't have to valet park as you might not be going off too often.If you are so lucky to even be in Hawaii...do not mess up the chance to stay here. \"It is all that.\"The room was a nice-sized moderately-priced 2 queen beds and the views were great. We stayed at the elegant Prince Tower (which a recommend) and had a lovely garden view... but, it was not a step down from the ocean views by a long shot...we felt and I can only imagine. It was wonderful to hear all the birds in the morning and the balcony was large yielding what seemed like an additional room to our accommodations. It was quiet. Hiltons are built well. You never hear a neighbor through the thick walls and are surprised to see next door neighbors in the hallway.The things to see are fantastic. I read that some grumpy guests complained about waiting for the Tram.... we never had a problem about that... if the Tram was not there we walked through the tastefully designed open ways that were filled with expensive and interesting art pieces and decor or going in other directions through some of the most breathtaking landscaped paths I've seen...like a botanical garden walk. It was amazing day or night. The other choice for getting around is water rail-assisted designer boats with charming attendants. Take a ride, you'll love the pace it takes you into. However, one gets about; it is special. Don't complain and just enjoy the thoughtfulness of the magnificent themes provided all around for a good imagination to thrive. Feast your eyes, heart and thoughts into this tropical abundance!The extensive meandering pools were busy, but wonderfully wet and opened 24 hours a day. The slide was fun for kids and adults too. The wade-through waterfalls were sparkling with good ions...I am sure! We kayaked and snorkeled in the hotel lagoon...both were controlled adventures but, once you accept that you can relax and enjoy this well orchestrated pleasantly staged environment presented too bring much joy to the lucky guest of the Hilton.Jump into one of the comfy hammocks and remember every summer of your life in a moment or just realize that you are not going to forget this time and space. Some call this hotel experience the Disneyland of the Hawaiian Islands and I tend to agree. If you can recall Disney Resorts, Worlds and Lands are also happy places. Good comparison reflecting upon this Island of Beauty as its backdrop to help with the details.The only problem we encountered was leaving the hotel grounds to see the rest of this Island's gems... but we finally did... and that is another story. Basically, Hawaii has many spectacular sights and beaches for either swimming or snorkeling and the drama of the terrain is memorable. Outside the Hilton hotel grounds, missing the difficult yet worthwhile 3 hour independent volcanic lava-flow walk at the National Park should be against the law for all tourists.I can not wait to return to this Hotel Village with its Grand atmosphere! I hope I will be ever again so fortunate in the future. Many Mahalos to the Hilton for making some dreams come true and sparking some new ones, as well. ", " My family (5 adults) just came back from staying here and really enjoyed it. There's plenty to do there at the hotel when you're not touring the beautiful island. Still, car rental is a must. The Kimo Coffee stand (there are 2 locations at the hotel) sells a great cup of coffee for $1- just keep your coffee cup and refill it each day. The nearby King's Shops have some cheap restaurants you can try including Dairy Queen and Subway. This is within walking distance. I recommend Roy's there as well. I'm not sure why people complain about the prices of the restaurants at the hotel; it's a well-known fact that hotel restaurants are generally expensive anywhere you go! You can also shop for groceries in Kona at the Safeway and store them in a fridge in your room ($6/day). Before I went I was curious about how close to the \"real beach\" we would be and now I know: the hotel has a sandy beach-like lagoon. No waves, obviously. You can rent paddleboats and floaties (or buy them for cheap at WalMart in Kona) and even snorkel here. The lagoon does have turtles and pufferfish. It closes at 5pm, but other pools remain open. Hapuna Beach is nearby for the real thing. My only complaint is that someone who works there questioned that my sister was a guest there! We are Hispanic and I guess he thought non-whites couldn't afford to stay there. Sorry for bringing down your neighborhood, sir. (Lest you think we are just being sensitive, this has happened to us many times.) Other than that one instance of chilling tackiness, we had a very nice stay. ", " Aloha!! My family of 5 adults just returned from a July 2003 trip here and we loved it! Beautiful resort with immaculate grounds. Rooms were roomy and comfortable and most of the service was very friendly and good. Great pools(with slides) and nice man-made beach and lagoon that is good for beginning snorkeling. The dolphin lagoon is wonderful and the Dolphin Quest program was one of the best experiences of my life (make reservations on-line before you go). Beautiful views just about eveywhere in resort. Be ready to walk ALOT on and off property on this trip (despite the cute boats and monorail-it's faster to walk everywhere in the resort). No real swimmable beach here in walking distance (but lots of beautiful ocean for snorkling with lava rock shores), but Hapuna State Beach Park with a great real swimmable beach is only about a 15 min. drive away. Renting a car at the airport is a must to see whole island, but be aware that self-parking everywhere (and especially at the Hilton Waikoloa) is limited, frustrating, and challenging and valet parking is just expensive. Resort food is the usual expensive fare for any hotel, but cheaper eats and fast food is easy to find in a 5 min. drive or 15 min. walk to the King's Shops or drive into Kona. You can also bring along a little hot pot and rent a mini-fridge from the hotel like we did, to make easy cheaper breakfasts, lunches, and snacks so you can splurge on the dinners. Groceries (about double the price of the mainland) are easy to get at Whaler's in the King's Shops or in Kona at the Safeway or Wal-Mart. We saw lots of people everyday at the resort bringing in groceries like us, so don't feel intimidated or cheap about doing it! This resort is mainly family oriented with lots for kids to do, but also lovely and romantic at night--take a moonlight stroll near the ocean on a tiki-torch lit path or end the evening resting in one of the many little hammocks near the beautiful shoreline. You can even watch the dolphins playing in the lagoon at night from afar! This resort was a great home to come back to each night after a busy day of sightseeing (the \"wet\" side of the island near Waimea and Hilo are green and lush) and we will definitely come back!! A couple of hints: we got great room rates at $188/night/room since my father is a senior and a member of AARP and a good discount on our rental car, too. Remember to look into things like that for savings! Also, check out the Wal-Mart in Kona for all those millions of gifts and souveneirs first--they had lots of the SAME items found all over the island for $2-$5 less (like cute $3.19 Kona, Hawaii t-shirts!). Mahalo!! ", " We came home on Tuesday and booked for next year on Thursday - it was that good. True this is a man-made paradise, but so is Palm Springs, Phoenix etc. Two kids aged 6 and 2 always had fun, Dolphin experience was pricey but also priceless. They will always remember it. Snorkeling in a safe logoon with fish and turtles, water slides and on and on. We stayed in the Palace tower and walked nearly everywhere. There is a wait for the tram or boat but the walk is less than that of a typical Las Vegas resort and much prettier. $1 shuttle to the Kings shops always on-time never had to wait. Great service everywhere. Drove the entire island and saw everything in one day including volcano, waterfalls every possible climate very fun. The rest of the week we were at the resort. Kohala spa seaside couples massage above the breaking waves - heaven. ", " This is an amazing resort. How many hotels can you think of that have private tram service from the lobby to the hotel tower? How about a romantic boat ride instead? The dolphin experience is a must. The private lagoon is a great safe place snorkel without worrying about the tide or waves. Multiple pools, hot tubs and water slides make it seem uncrowded. The rooms are somewhat ordinary but we rarely spent any time in them. ", " This is truly a great resort for families. Our family consists of a 7 yo and 2 1/2 yo. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The only negative would be the expense of meals at the resort. I would suggest eating a few meals in Kona where prices are quite reasonable. While some complain of waiting for a ride (boat or train) to different parts of the resort I would suggest you try walking. It is not that far. We will definately go back. ", " Just got back and am ready to go again. We had a great time walking the grounds every morning and watching the whales play right off the shore! We toured the island and was amazed at the beauty and diversity we found. The only thing we didn't like was the high prices for the food that was ok but not worth the price. Instead we ate at Bubba Gump's for breakfast and dinner and loved it and the prices! ", " This hotel is great!!!! It is a very nice and pretty hotel. When you enter and go to your building you can go in a train or in a boat. This is a very cool hotel that the kids will enjoy all the pools. They have GREAT slides!! The kids spent all day in there. They never got bored. There are 3 towers; the lagoon tower, the palace tower and the ocean tower. We stayed in the ocean tower. If you would like to do more exercise, you can walk through all towers. Between the towers, are little facts along you walk, like a little musuem; just in case you want an educational trip to hawaii. You should also try swimming with the dolphins. Its a lot of money though. The man-made beach is okay, but you should rent a car to go to a real ocean. It is a nice walk around the pools with little sculptures of the animals of the chinese years. This hotel is great for the whole family. Everyone will enjoy it!!! *********Extra Tip; if your in a hurry to head back to your room, the train is faster than the boat ; ) ", " It would be very difficult to find a better hotel in Hawaii, The hilton Waikoloa Village was everything I thought it would be, the rooms are good size with a lanai and are serviced several times a day. I stayed in the Ocean tower and had a great view of the golf course and ocean. The lagoon was great fun with Kayaking, snorkeling and other activities available, be sure to ask for the ohana package at the watersports desk by the lagoon to get unlimited use of all the equipment during your stay for $49.00 per person. The kayaks alone were $20 per hour so it is an excellent deal. My only complaint was that the front desk staff were rude at check in and that the manager on duty then, Dave was even more immuture and rude than his staff. but everyone else at the hotel could not have been nicer. The resort is very spread out and you will walk alot, but in those beautiful surroundings it just didn't seem to matter. The food at the resort is rather expensive, but no more so than any nice resort, lower prices are available at the kings shoppes a 10 minute walk away . This was a fantastic hotel and I cannot imaging anyone not being happy here , I was, and I travel more than most people and I am hard to please. ", " Our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village was amazing! From the gorgeous pools to the incredible restaurants...we were so pleased with every aspect of our vacation! Our favorite restaurant was the Provision Company...what a view from the terrace! It was so romantic with the ocean breeze gently blowing through the windows of the rooms! The service at Waikoloa was so friendly. We loved being able to take the tram or the boat from the tower to the restaurants and pools. The most memorable moment for us was falling asleep in one of the hammocks that was set up in the sand, while watching the full moon over the ocean. A relaxing vacation doesn't get much better than that! We plan on returning to the resort again in 2005! ", " We have travelled to many resorts around the world, including other Hilton resorts, but this must be one of the best we have stayed in. The resort is beautiful, our 2 rooms (one for the kids) were in the Ocean Tower & had everything we needed, including a spectacular ocean view! Also the service we received from the staff was second to none.After reading a lot of negative views on TripAdviser, I was a little nervous about what the resort would be like (especially considering it takes virtually 2 days to travel from the UK to Hawaii). However my fears were unfounded as were many of the complaints other reviewers had made. We hired a car & didn't find the walk form the car park to the hotel a problem at all. The resort is huge, so it can take a little while to get where you want to - but both the tram & boat services are efficient and walking was not a problem for us (it took all of 10 mins to walk from the lobby to Ocean Towers). Plus we were on holiday - we wanted to slow the pace down a little anyway!The lagoon was clean & it was a delight for my kids to swim with wild sea turtles there. All the pools were great fun for adults & kids alike (if you don't like kids there is a pool only for adults).Eating in the restaurants is expensive (not more so than other resorts we have been to in the Caribbean/Asia) so we recommend renting a car to sample the local cuisine - most of it excellent if you avoid the ubiquitous fast food joints in the towns(especially recommend Huggos in Kona - go for sunset as it overlooks the ocean).Do ask for a refrigerator for your room for sodas etc this will save you money.If you can, do the dolphin experience - but book ahead. We were glad we booked 2 months ahead, as they were turning people away who hadn't pre-booked.If you are looking for a beautiful white sandy beach, head North to Hapuna Beach Park (7 miles), but go early in the morning as it gets busy later.Essentially, we were sad to leave, but hope to return again one day soon... ", " Just returned from 10 days in Hawaii, 6 nights of which were spent at the Waikoloa Hilton. This is a great hotel. We stayed in the Palace Tower, 7th Floor. We used our Hilton points for this vacation (husband is Silver). Beautifully remodeled rooms. In our opinion, this is the best tower! Our room was equipped with a fridge/safe/coffeemaker, none of which was at an extra charge. If you are Gold level of Hilton Honors program, there is a refreshment room that is open in the am and late afternoon. Parking is free. If you valet, it is $10.50.The Ocean tower has birds in their atrium, which are noisy in the late afternoon. Also, during our stay, they were jack hammering and remodeling a pool inside the tower. Very noisy! The Lagoon Tower also had the birds and the boat driver had an umbrella to protect him as we headed under the trees. The Palace Tower is strategically between everything. The lagoon (very clean, great snorkeling) is just across a bridge, the ocean tower pool (smaller and quieter than the Lagoon Tower Pool) is a short walk also. Really, everything is a short walk or ride on the train or boat. We rarely had to wait very long for either the boat or train. Beautiful art lining the corridors between towers! Free cabanas and covered loungers, be sure to find a strategic one on the Ocean tower bluff to watch the sunset!We were there during Thanksgiving week, and as previous reviewers have said, it never seemed crowded. We tried all the pools, Lagoon and hot tubs (hot tubs in Lagoon Tower pool only). This is the Disneyland of hotels and there is plenty to keep you busy! My children, 10 and 6 did the Dolphin encounter and loved it. Book online about 2 months in advance!We shopped at both Safeway (in Kona) and Costco (by the airport) and stocked up on cereal, snacks, and lunch stuff for the kids. Kona is 30-40 minute drive from Waikoloa. Waimea is about 20 miles northeast, and they have a grocery store there as well. The Hilton is approx. 20 minutes north of the airport.For dinner, we ate at the Hilton\u2019s Japanese restaurant (like Benihana\u2019s). For $220 for our family of four, I thought it was a little pricey and the food was average. We had two incredible meals at Caf\u00e9 Pesto, in a small harbor town about 10 minutes north of the resort. In this same town, we ate at Tres Hombres, Mexican faire. Service was bad, but food was pretty good. Both had a good children\u2019s menu. Dinner for 4 was about $80 at both places. We also ate at the Kona Brewing Company in Kona. Outdoor dining and the food and beer were great. There is a great used bookstore on the other side of the parking lot, to stock up on your vacation reading!We would love to return to the Hilton Waikoloa! ", " We just returned from a seven night stay at the HWV \u2013 Ocean Tower Room 8003. When I checked in I was told that we\u2019d been put in the Palace Tower \u2013 Mountain View. I politely asked for a room in the Ocean Tower and it was no problem.The room was very nice \u2013 4 star all the way. Hawaiian style furnishings, walk-in closet, couch/coffee table, king bed, etc. was all outstanding. The bed was VERY comfortable with a down comforter and six (!) nice big pillows. The view from our balcony was breathtaking! We could see all the way from the mountains to the east to the lagoon, and west to the ocean \u2013 WOW!!!We got a great deal on this property via Priceline, but I have to say that it would have been worth the $209/night at Hilton. Everything about the property is immaculate \u2013 the gardeners were constantly sprucing things up and housekeeping was top-notch.The pools and lagoon are the BEST! The only down-sides at the HWV have already been noted by others \u2013 it\u2019s a BIG property and the food is mediocre and ridiculously expensive ($5.95 for a half of papaya!). But, we were expecting it and only ate one real meal on property \u2013 a $110 dinner at the Provision Company that I asked to have removed from our bill because it was so bad (think $32 for a piece of steak that I couldn\u2019t even chew). (For local eats I highly recommend Caf\u00e9 Pesto and Jameson\u2019s). All of that having been said, I still think that the HWV is PARADISE and I would return in a second. Having a lagoon on property with great snorkeling (we saw tons of fish and four sea turtles) is a real treat. The public spaces are breathtaking and all of the semi-private alcoves with hammocks and lounge chairs from which one can watch the sunset each night was wonderful.I highly recommend the HWV \u2013 it was a GREAT getaway! ", " My wife and I stayed July 9-13 at the Hilton as part of my R&R from Iraq. I am a Silver HHonors member and used points for the entire stay. The reservations were made for a 'garden view,' but we were upgraded to a beautiful ocean view room in the Ocean Tower. We used valet parking and were suprisingly not charged for it, although it would have been worth the $10.50 to us. We took the advice of other TripAdvisor members and went directly from the airport to Costco to purchase liquor, coffee, and breakfast pastries. We forgot coffee filters, which Hilton sent to our room gratis.The bed was very comfortable. I enjoyed starting my day with freshly brewed Kona coffee, a (Costco) croissant, and the USA Today on the lanai overlooking the ocean.Hilton offers a boat and monorail service, but it is just as fast to walk. My wife failed to make a reservation for DolphinQuest in advance (recommend you do so), but by agreeing to sit through a HVC presentation, she got her DolphinQuest slot for a total price of $20.00 (normally $165) She loved the dolphins. The timeshare presentation was tolerable, but did take 90 minutes (we didn't bite).We didn't eat in any of the hotel's restaurants because of the prices, but didn't find any great bargains elsewhere either. We ate at Merriman's Market, Big Island Steak House, Huggo's on the Rocks (in Kona) and Aeoli's in Waimia. All were good, if unremarkable.We visited Volcanos National Park and enjoyed our time there. Our helicopter trip (Sunshine Tours) was canceled due to a problem during preflight. It might be worth the extra money to use Blue Hawaiian, which has multiple aircraft and it located near the hotel. It is about 2 1/2 hours to the park from the Hilton. Part of the trip goes through a rain forest, so be prepared to put the top up. The lagoon was somewhat murky, but we were able to follow a sea turtle around, and saw eels and numerous other fish while snorkling there.The staff did a great job. My car was always ready when I called for it. On our last day, they were unable to extend our check-out time, but they stored our luggage and let us use the health club to change and shower so we could continue to use the pool until it was time to drive to the airport. I called valet from the club and my car was packed and waiting when I got there from the club.I'm sorry that some members have not had a pleasant experience at this hotel, but we truly enjoyed ourselves. We will certainly return to the Hilton Waikoloa when we visit the Big Island. ", " We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Resort. The room was beautiful and conveniently laid out (we stayed in the Palace Tower). The breakfast provided in the Honors Club was fresh and delicious. The service throughout the property was fantastic.The pools were pristine and huge! The snorkeling lagoon was great, although the visibility decreased throughout the day due to suntan lotion, etc. The different types of marine life were spectacular and there is additional snorkeling all along the resort's waterfront. The \"A\" Bay is about 2 minutes away by car for additional ocean swimming and the fabulous Hapuna Beach is at most 10 minutes away.The food was decent throughout the resort, although the buffet dinner was overpriced and underwhelming. Additionally the King's Shops offer several other dining options (Roy's, etc.)This was an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable stay. The size of the resort is large enough to feel spacious and spread out the crowds while not feeling unmanageable. The trams and boats were a nice transportation option although we usually preferred to walk and enjoy the art galleries around the property.We will definitely return. ", " Hilton Waikoloa. Great place to stay, really nice room overlooking the mountain in the Lagoon Tower. This is the best tower since it is close to the lobby (and therefore your car) and the pools. There was never a problem getting pool chairs and the pools were clean and well maintained. You do need to sign out towels every day and get a wrist band to use the slide. The room was clean and the bathroom huge. There is a safe (which they charge you for if you \u201cactivate\u201d by calling, but we didn\u2019t see the note so we used the safe without charge for our entire stay, but that was an accident) and a refrigerator. We bought drinks and small breakfast stuff and kept it in the room, along with snacks. It is true that this type of stuff is very over priced at the resort. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I\u2019m not sure why people are giving the hotel such low marks since we didn\u2019t see any of the things people have complained about. We went to the welcome talk (which included coffee and pastries) our first day there and it was great. They gave an honest and informative opinion of what to do and not do on the island. Everything that they recommended that we did was excellent, including our trip to North Kohala (go to the Kohala book store and all the small towns along the way which are really fun to explore, Hawaiian Dreams ice cream in Hawi, Merriman\u2019s in Waimea). We decided not to go to the volcano since it was a 2 \u00bd hour trip to the national park, another 45 minute drive down Craters Road and another 2 hour hike to the active lava fields. Instead we drove to Hilo and stopped along the way. Even this wasn\u2019t quite worth it. Hilo isn\u2019t a very fun place \u2013 we didn\u2019t even eat there, but definitely stop at Tex Drive-In in Honoka\u2019a (which is on 19 \u2013 everything is easy to find since there really is just one road. I don\u2019t think we got lost once on the island!). They have a nice breakfast and really great donuts with fillings called malasadas. We went straight to Rainbow Falls/Boiling Pots right outside of Hilo since you need to get there before 10am if you want to see rainbows. Unfortunately it was drizzling so we didn\u2019t see any rainbows! On the way back we stopped at Akaka Falls, which were beautiful. The town is also really neat. Lots of fun stores to explore and a nice restaurant with good food and ice cream. If I were to do it again we wouldn\u2019t go to Hilo, just Akaka!We booked the snorkel trip (Fair Wind) through the AMEX office at the resort and they were very helpful and the trip was excellent. We took an afternoon trip because the morning trips were booked up, but I would suggest a morning trip (which might mean booking before you leave) since it is not as hot, the water is calmer and you get going early rather than hanging out until it is time to go. The boat was great, the crew well trained and really nice and we had a great time. They give you a basic snorkeling lesson if you need it, you can take snuba (for an additional $60 a head!) if you want and off you go. They even had vision correcting goggles, which was great for my husband who wears glasses. Our trip was the deluxe so it included a late lunch. We didn\u2019t realize that meant not eating until after 4pm so the kids were famished, but the staff pulled out some snacks beforehand to accommodate us. Really nice! Another nice feature is that they give you life bands. These go around your waist so you float and don\u2019t have to worry about keeping yourself up so you can concentrate on the fish. It really made our time in the water easy! We couldn\u2019t believe how quickly 2 \u00bd hours in the water went. Definitely worth it!We also went to Farmer\u2019s Market (Hualalai Road), which is open a few days a week. If you are looking for inexpensive necklaces, etc. this is the place to go. Most vendors take cash only. We didn\u2019t spend much time shopping in Kona which was fine. The small towns around the island are the places to explore since they are unique stores with their own fun merchandise. Food wise we ate at some great and not so great places. Merriman\u2019s in Wailea is nice and the food good (we had lunch there, but they also serve dinner). Near the Hilton are the Kings Shops which include restaurants, clothing, and jewelry and food stores. We picked up some food there, but it is a bit overpriced versus the grocery stores in Kona or Wailea (KTA or Foodland). We ate at the Big Island Steakhouse which was mediocre. The fish was a bit overcooked (and that is a specialty) and the service weak. I\u2019d avoid it. We tried the Kamuela Provision Company at the Hilton since it had good seafood (which was true) and a beautiful location (also true). Make reservations early so you can see the sunset over the water and ask to be seated outside. This was pricey, but worth it. We didn\u2019t try the other hotel restaurants. After our snorkel trip we went to Drysdale\u2019s in the mall nearby and it was good, inexpensive family fare and they had some great hula entertainment right outside our window.We also rented a kayak for 30 minutes in the hotel lagoon. It was a bit overpriced, but fun. Actually we also rented a water bike for two and two of us used the kayak for 15 minutes while the other two used the bike and then we switched. A half hour was plenty of time for this activity. It was really neat getting close to the sea turtles that live in the lagoon, and all the other ocean fish.We didn\u2019t do the Dolphin adventure, but lots of others did, but we did watch their antics from the seats nearby and that was enjoyable.Finally, I\u2019d recommend buying a guide book called Big Island by Paradise Family Guides. It is great (we got it for Maui too). It rates restaurants, hotels, place to go, etc. all with an eye on family vacations. It was amazingly accurate and we came to rely on it wherever we were! ", " We stayed here for 5 days as part of our honeymoon & we loved it!Yes it is pricey but then no expenses should be spared for your honeymoon in our opinion.It is very deserted, you do need a car to get around but thats what made it is so different to any other holiday. We spent 5 days at Hilton Hawaiian Village, Oahu & that was equally magical.Although I have to stay any longer than about 4/5 days & you would get bored as there is not as much to do on this island as perhaps in Oahu. The memories will stay with us forever..... ", " Our family stayed at this hotel for 8 days and we had a wonderful, fun and relaxing time. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again on our next trip to the big island. My children are 6 and 8 and they had fun snorkeling in the lagoon, exploring the grounds, riding the paddleboats and playing with other kids. The grounds are beautiful and there are two huge pools with multiple slides for the kids to play on. The hotel was able to accomodate an early checkin for us and also gave us a complimentary upgrade to an oceanview room. The room was large and included a big walk-in closest which was awesome - no more tripping over suitcases and wet bathing suits. We also had a refrigerator and a private lanai which was great for evening cocktails. Beds were very comfortable.The distance between each of the towers is not excessive and each tower seemed to have something special to offer. If you are traveling with small children, I would recommend either the Ocean or the Lagoon towers because they have inexpensive/kid-friendly dining options available and are closest to each of the main pools. If traveling without kids, I think the Palace tower is quietest and closest to most of the fine dining establishments (Donatoni's, Imari, Kirin). Every tower has a small shop with beach items, clothing, snacks, liquor, books/magazines and gifts. The Lagoon tower has additional specialty shops for things like jewelry, footwear, resort clothing and artwork.Despite complaints of having to walk (in a tropical paradise) from other reviewers, we enjoyed walking to each of the different towers - there is a covered walkway that connects each building - and you can view incredible artwork (statues, paintings, artifacts) on one side and view the ocean, lagoon, and pools on the other. You can also cross over the boat waterway on one of the many bridges and walk along the ocean path to get to the pools a little quicker - it's a beautiful area for strolling. When we did take the tram or boats, we never waited more than 5 minutes for one to show up. We never really adjusted to the Hawaii timezone and found ourselves up at 6 or 7am everyday. We really enjoyed taking the beachwalk to the coffee shop in the Lagoon tower and then taking a boatride to the Ocean tower for breakfast or to just look at the fish and turtles. We hit the pools or the lagoon early - it was very sunny each morning and there was a great ocean breeze so it never felt really hot. There was never a shortage of lounge chairs around the pools and there were secluded cabanas and hammocks throughout the resort, many looked out over the ocean. Each pool area has a towel \"cave\" where they provide towels and armbands for guests. You have to provide your room number and name to get towels, and they warn that there is a $35 charge for unreturned towels, but they don't monitor what gets returned or follow through with the charges. In the late afternoon (around 3ish), we'd head back to the room for showers and would then go exploring.We ate breakfast and lunch at the resort most days and had dinner on the road. For breakfast, we we either had something quick at the coffee shop or went all out at the Palm Terrace buffet - tehy had a wonderful variety of items. We had most of our lunches at the grill closest to the Dolphin Quest area. The dining was a little more expensive than what we are used to but not too bad, you just had to be careful about what you ordered. For example, we purchased good sized kids meals for about $8 apiece which is quite reasonable. We then made the sorry mistake of ordering virgin smoothies which, we found out when the bill arrived, were also $8.00. We went to the nearby Kings Shops for a few meals and had an amazing breakfast at the Big Island Steakhouse and a great lunch at Merrimans. The shops are a 15 minute walk or a quick shuttle ride away and include a Macy's, various surf shops, a general store (with all types of alcohol), food court, restaurants and gas station.We had all of our dinners offsite - hotel restaurants have a dress code, which we did not plan for, and we wanted to see more of the island. If you are staying more than a few days, a rental car is a must! Waikoloa is a resort area and doesn't give you a feel for the \"real\" Hawaii. We took afternoon excursions into Kona, Kawaihae, Hawi, Kapaau and Waimea. We went north and had dinners at the Harbor Grill, Bamboo and Merrimans which were very good with many authentic island specialties. A few nights, we drove into Kona and had casual dinners at Huggo's on the Rocks and LuLu's where we overlooked the ocean and watched the sunset. The meals weren't spectacular but the scenery was!The Hilton offers so many activities, it's hard to know where to start. There is a great scuba shop on site called Redsail Sports - my husband did a few 2-tank dives and said the groups were small and the dive masters really fun and helpful. We also enrolled the kids in the Dolphin Quest Kids Camp which was the highlight of their visit - I would highly recommend this, it's worth every penny. We went to the Friday night Luau and the kids had a blast - the servers made an effort to seat families with kids together so they stayed entertained and didn't bother the honeymooners. There was a good variety of foods, the MC was an entertaining story teller (informative but not boring), and the dancers were great. I had questioned going thinking it might be a bit theaterish but I was surprised at how much fun we had. Lastly, we spent a few mornings at the lagoon boating, snorkeling, or floating out to the waterfall. There are a lot of fish to see and there was a sea turtle that visited a few times each day.We did not drive to Volcano National park as we didn't want to spend excessive amounts of time in the car or hiking. Instead, we took a 2 hour helicopter tour (I think the name was Blue hawaiian) over the volcano and around the island. The tour was great for my husband and 8 year old - the pilot provided constant commentary on what they were looking at the many of the environmental impacts the volcano and tourism had on the island. It was costly - about 350 per person - but worthwhile to do once. I would not recommend the ride for young kids - my 6 year old got sick, which made me sick....Checking out was a little painful - we didn't realize how many items we placed on our room charge so we were a bit surprised with the final bill. However, I still think the hotel was a good value based on everything they offered to guests. The Hilton was not able to give us a late check-out as our room category was sold out. They did provide us with a changing room which they allow guests to use on a first come/first served basis. This was a wonderful service - we got to spend the entire day at the pool and then had a convenient place to shower and clean up before our 9pm flight.The only disappointment we experienced was the closure of the Kona pool slide for renovations while we were there. This is the largest slide at the resort but we still managed to enjoy ourselves on the slides at the Kohala pool. ", " This resort really lived up to its reputation. The grounds are gorgeous; the staff members are friendly and helpful. The price is good, especially for what you get. I purchased this five night trip for a $350 deposit followed up by a payment of $550 at booking time through a telephone solicitation from Hilton Grand Vacations. That came out to be $180 per night including tax and I even got a $50 bonus to use at the resort, although many places did not accept the vouchers.If you are a Hilton Honors Member with Gold or higher status (and maybe even Silver), you can get a free continental breakfast and noon snack service in a suite at the top of the Palace Tower. I would not recommend staying in the Palace Tower, however, because the distance from the lobby is inconvenient and the view is not as good as the other two towers. For the most convenience and best view, I would recommend the Lagoon Tower.The only things against this wonderful place is that the distance between the towers is too far from each other and the lobby (except the Lagoon Tower), the location of the resort is far from town (20 miles), and the clientele tends to be honeymooners or sleepy older couples or families. I personally prefer a younger, more active crowd rather than folks that just want to lounge around their whole trip. One more thing is that the beds are small, full-sized, which is cozy for four in a room. The couch does not fold out into a bed.The distance between the towers got to be pretty annoying. They have a quaint gondola, which, ironically enough turn out to be faster than the trams that run between the towers. The tram stops have nice computer screens that are coupled to a GPS-based system that keeps track of the location of the trains and the arrival times. They were completely unreliable. I saw the timer indicate negative minutes, 20 minutes, followed by six minutes until the tram came. If you are in the Lagoon Tower, plan on walking instead of waiting for the transportation.The location of the resort is surprisingly annoying unless you plan on staying at the resort all of the time. The distance to shopping and town in Kona is about 20 miles. After several trips to town, I wish that this great place was located next to town. The town of Kona is a great place to visit with its quaint downtown as well as megastores such as Costco, Wal*Mart, KMart and others. The restaurants in downtown along the water are great. The drivers are extremely slow so be prepared to be patient when getting stuck in traffic, especially during rush hours (yes, in Hawaii!).The spa was great. It was one of the nicer spa facilities to which I have visited and was very quiet if you like that. I prefer a little more life. The massage was nice, but overpriced if you do not have vouchers to use.One more word of advice, do not waste your time visiting Hilo. It is a dump. If you happen to visit the Volcano Park near there, make sure that you are not hungry if it is late because the restaurants close around 9 PM and the remaining restaurant, Ken\u2019s Pancake House, is really bad. Highway 200 is a great way to get between Waikoloa and Hilo\u2019s few attractions because it is fairly unused and Hawaiian drivers are the slowest around. ", " We stayed for 7 nights and had a great experience at this resort, although almost all of our time was spent off the resort property exploring all the amazing things the island has to offer. I find the bad reviews annoying - so much of what folks complain about is to be expected. I'll address the negatives first - yes, there are birds that chirp. Tropical island, isn't it?? The lagoon at the hotel is of course murky - it's a man-made lagoon. If you want good beaches and snorkeling, try one of the amazing beaches on the Island. Yes, hotel food is often expensive. That's standard. We ate off the property except for one dinner Donatoni's, which was good (but over-priced). I couldn't understand why people were waiting in long lines to eat breakfast at the resort, we opted for coffee and pastries from Kimo Bean (the coffee kiosk in both towers) before heading out for the day. The Hilton is the the Ritz or Four Season's, so best not to expect that kind of experience. HOWEVER, we had a great experience. The parking lot is not far at all from the hotel, a 3-5 minute walk depending on the spot and we had no problem finding spots. Our room was spacious and clean. Our bed was SO SOFT, and our duvet was a crisp clean white and very comfortable. We emptied out our mini-fridge and filled it with wine and other groceries we bought at Walmart in Kona and the maid had no problem with this. The pools were great and had no smells. We had a great experience and would go back again. My advice, leave the Disneyland of Hawaii and experience the wonders of the Island!If you are looking for great food, head north to Cafe Pesto and try the risotto, or south to Kona and go to the Kona Brewing Company for great pizza and beer. Roy's is right by the hotel and was good, and a great option if you want to stay near the hotel. Enjoy! ", " I can't understand what people are complaining about!The hotel has so much to do and see that you never actually need to leave the hotel. They have thought of everything, from first class pools and spas to a man-made beach and dolphin lagoon.The rooms are spacious and clean and the hotel is designed to give maximum rooms ocean views for the fabulous sunsets.We hired a car and the location is very good for exploring the island - but we cut back on our day trip plans to allow us to spend more time in the resort.Food and drinks are expensive - but not any more so than in any 5* Hilton. We felt that whilst this holiday was expensive we got what we paid for - luxury! ", " After reading several reviews about this hotel, I was nervous to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. After staying there the first week of March, 2006, I cannot believe how wrong these people were. For example, the trams and boat shuttles were not crowded, nor did we have to wait forever to catch a ride (we even stayed at the hotel during HP's winner circle convention-they alone had 1500+ guests at the resort). Next, it did not take years, as many reviews suggested, to walk to and from the different hotels (Lagoon, Palace and Ocean) to the lobby. If anything, the walk was very relaxing, and it showcased amazing art. Truth be told, I think people are lazy! In addition, the self-park area was super close to the lobby and we could easily access this area. In addition, the pools were NOT cold, the grounds were very clean and the service was excellent everywhere at the resort, including the restaurants and spa. Some mentioned that this resort was mainly for kids but we felt that even though there were a lot of kids at the resort and a huge HP convention, there were numerous times when we would walk around the resort and hang out and it was very serene and quiet. Several nights we had the pool areas to ourselves or the numerous hammocks that line the ocean. We also marveled at how quiet our seaside massages were and the restaurants. Overall, we would recommend this resort to anyone, even the most discriminating traveler. I say this after having stayed at several Four Season and other high-end resort properties. We are already planning on returning next year and will bring our children and our parents. ", " We stay at Waikoloa Hilton several times a year. The reason we keep coming back is the pools, pool slides and the grounds. We've traveled extensively and besides Disney, we have never seen such great pools and grounds. It works for us and our toddler. Yes, if you don't like to walk, consider going elsewhere. If you have a tight agenda, forget it. If you come here, leave your watch at home and just hang loose. Strollers are a little bit of a hassle, but we use the makai(ocean)trails and take in the ocean air. The food is a little pricey but good and nothing unusual for an oceanfront, high-end hotel. I recommend trying the specialty restaurants. The breakfast buffet (~$25pp) are plentiful and fill us up until late afternoon, young children eat free. Consider, for the price of the hotel you get free entertainment all day vs paying for a water park, dolphin show, museum, boat and train rides, beautiful garden grounds, etc without having to drive from your hotel. Plus, it's easy to stroll back to the room for a nap. Come to relax and hang loose otherwise speed on by. ", " We visitied here from April 21 - April 26th. My husband was a Diamond member, so we used his points for a package stay. I really wasn't expecting much, with reading some previous reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We loved it. This was a trip for my husband and I, we left our 2 year old with grandparents at home. This is definetly a family friendly hotel, but we did not feel overwhelmed by too much hussle and bussel of kids (which may be because they said this was an off time of year to go) At times, I felt we were the only people here. The weather was perfect. Grounds and pools:The landscaping, pool, lagoon, artwork, was all absolutely gorgeous. The water in the pool is not cold, we were there the week after a previous post, and I saw no one complaining of the temperature. Yes, it was a little chilly getting in at first, but took no time getting use to it. Believe me, you would rather cold than hot. We visited Hapuna Beach, and went up to the hotel there to eat at their outside restaurant, and dipped in their pool. It was really warm! It felt terrible, like swimming in bath water. Many of the people at this hotel were complaining.Accomodations:We stayed in the ocean tower, and had a nice view of the ocean. Rooms were clean and nice. I don't think our room had gone through renovations yet, but I wouldn't complain. Especially since we were using points to stayTrams/Boats:We didn't really use them much. Yes, you might have to walk aways, but it is very doable. I felt like you had to wait awhile sometimes for the tram/boat, but that might be because I am impatient, and would rather get the excercise and walk. The walk is absolutely gorgeous, so take it in and enjoy. We even had one of the longest walks, staying in the ocean tower.Parking:Yes, you do have to park a little ways out, but it isn't a bad walk. If you do get in late and have to valet because of no spots, they don't charge you for the valet. So, remember that.Best tourist book:\"Hawaii: The Big Island Revealed\", by Wizard Publication, Inc.I loved this book. It gave a lot of great suggestions, and was an easy read. The authors are pretty funny. You can even buy it at the gift shop at the hotel.Best Beach:Hapuna Beach, I thought his beach was much better than the one by the hotel. Hapuna Beach doesn't take long to get to (by rental car). There is a hotel there, so you can go up and grab a decent lunch (maybe not the cheapest.) There is also a snack shop on this beach, didn't go, but saw many that did. We brought a collapsable cooler (with us from home) that we filled with beer and water to take to the beach. We also used this at the hotel. Only once was I laying out at the hotel and did someone come over to take a drink order. So, we brought our own...I know they say not to, but no one said anything . We got our waters and drinks at the Kings Shopps down the road at a litlte grocery store there.Best Restaurants:At the hotel we really liked Kamuela Provision Company (view at sunset is great) and Donatoni's. The food is great and the price is about what you would expect at a Hawaiin resort. The bottles of wine is where they really get you, but what do you expect.Off hotel restuarunts: Would HIGHLY recommend Merriman's Cafe at the Kings Shops. Incredible fish dishes, and you can actually get a decent bottle of wine without breaking the bank. Also, for a lesser expensive alternative: Cafe Pesto (Italian). For other suggestions, check out the book I previously mentioned. Tip for Diamond members taking a late flight out after having to check out:Since you have free access to the spa, just check your luggage with the bell boy after checking out. Have a great day at the pool, then use the spa to shower and get ready before flight.Best couples sunset spot:The hammock directly facing the ocean by the wedding chapel. Absolutely gorgeous. Of course, family can set on the lawn there as well. Great picture spot.Overall, a very, very relaxing vacation. Things seem to be on slow mode here, no loud beach music, just relaxing. Staff was great, hotel was clean, the surroundings are amazing. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is a beautiful first class resort, but bring your wallet! The grounds are gorgeous, the room very comfortable, and the food was outstanding at every meal. We thoroughly enjoyed our 7 night stay there. We had a deluxe ocean view room in the \"Lagoon\" Tower and it is worth the extra money to be able to hear and see the ocean. We would recommend buying your snacks and drinks away from the resort, use the refrigerator provided, and not use the mini-bar. We had one small bottle of wine and one small bottle of champagne (not normally high priced brands) from the mini-bar and it cost over $31.00 (you can buy four of these size bottles from the grocery for around $6.00)!! Room service is also expensive since they add a 19% service charge to your order and that is before the gratuity. Our meals ranged from approx. $40 for breakfast to over $100 for dinner (for two) at the resort's restaurants (which were wonderful by the way). Despite the high prices though, we had a truly fantastic stay there and would do it again in a minute!! ", " Stayed at this property in early June. On the day we departed, we packed our suitcases and left for breakfast. While at breakfast, someone entered our room and helped themselves to half the clothes in my suitcase. Luckily we did not leave the island for another week. Once we arrived at our next destination, we realized the theft. Contacted the hotel and the missing items were magically found in Lost and Found. Note: Hotel staff's belongings are regularly checked before they leave at the end of their shift. If items are left in Lost and Found for 30 days then the items become property of the person who stole the items! Nice! Do yourself a favor and lock your valuables in the room safe buy yourself a suitcase lock and use it when you leave your room too! I'm sure that the hotel staff were counting on us leaving the island. Then the blame would have naturally fell on the airline carrier, never thinking it happened at the hotel! ", " I'm returning to Hawaii soon and plan to visit the Big Island. I stayed at this property in April and the experience was bad. The rooms in the Ocean Tower are dated, with carpeting under the bathroom sink. Yuck. There was construction directly outside our room, producing a lot of noise. And the Lavaman Triathlon going on that week made parking impossible, with cars everywhere, including the curbs and walking areas. Upon checking out, we explained some of the issues to the staff, who showed absolutely no concern. As a Hilton Honors member, I will not return to, or recommend, this property. ", " My husband decided to book our family vacation but we were very disappointed. This place is not all that. They do have dolphins and a lagoon but I wasn't impressed by it. I wanted to end our vacation early. The hotel is boring. The hotel rooms give me the creeps and not a fan of the decor and art work but maybe that's just me. I just didn't get that Hawaiian feeling being here. You have to walk so far to get anywhere. The shuttle in a schedule so if you miss it you end up walking and the beach is like a mile away. I wanted to end my vacation early. I'm used to better hotels. I won't come back and I don't recommend. ", " Great hotel and grounds, however, I noticed a few bowls full of \"Poison\" all over the place. Asked an employee about it and he said they were to \"Lower the population of feral cats in the facility\". Are you serious? Who wants to stay at a place that purposely harms animals? I'm not the biggest animal person but I did enjoy visits from the cats. This place is heartless. Also, thanks for placing two charges for valet parking, even though I parked myself. ", " This hotel needs updating. Staff members are slow to respond and do not value Hilton Honors members. Extremely overpriced for what you get. Very limited serviers at pool area. We had to go to the bar ourselves for all orders. ", " We are not resort people, but were on a trip planned by others. First part was at The Grand Wailea on Maui, which made us think resorts weren't always bad. Then we had to come here, and it lived up to everything we hate about resorts. If you have kids, you may like it. The dolphins were great. That's the one star. It is absolutely huge. Nickleodeon films here. The pool bars close at 5p. The Orchid Market is only open from 11-4. There is no actual beach. Rooms are just so so. If you have mobility issues, or just difficulty walking distances, DO NOT stay here. Yes, there is a tram, and yes, there is a boat. My husband and I brought his parents with us here, my mother in law has trouble walking. Even with the tram, she had tremendous distances to walk to her room or anywhere else. Now, she made the most of it, because she could see the dolphins from her room. So there is that. One star. ", " Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. Don't ruin your Hawaiian vacation by staying at this horrible resort.In my first room, the TV remote would stop working after 10-15 minutes if I wasn't using it, then the picture froze but sound remained on. Had to unplug the TV each time this happened to get it working again. Next, the cell phone USB port next to my bed didn't work. Each time they sent engineering to my room and nothing was solved. I asked for a new room and was moved 2 rooms down the hall. In the new room, I tried to play a DVD, and the player didn't work. Engineering came up for the third time today, turns out the DVD player wasn't connected to the TV. They did give me a free dinner voucher for my trouble, problem was it expired the day before I received it!I read in recent reviews that their was an assault here and the guy was never caught. The hotel apparently did very little to help the victim and family. They claimed the cameras in the area it happened were broken. You would think after something like this they would have security guards on site, however I haven't seen any.They also keep dolphins in captivity as show animals. It's horrible to watch those amazing, intelligent creatures contained in such a small area, especially with the ocean right across from them.Again, stay elsewhere. I would stay in a tent before coming back to such a horribly run establishment. ", " This is a huge hotel that you have to take a tram to get around or walk at least ten minutes to get to anything, including your car. It is clear the hotel wants you to stay on the grounds for your entire stay - however, if you did, why would you bother to come to Hawaii at all? Yes, there is a distance view of the ocean, but no beach or beach activities (the beach are fake large white rocks you can't walk on). If you want to go to the beach it is a 20 minute walk or you have to walk 10 minutes to get to your car to drive 5 minutes. Want to have a romantic cocktail near the water? Better do it during the day with kids running everywhere because all bars close early, except one full of young kids screeching karaoke. I don't get this hotel or the positive reviews. ", " Staff unhelpful and do not care about your concerns. Value extremely poor. Reported concern and was blown off by \"customer service\" and told we will look into it. No follow up, and ultimately left me without an answer. ", " we stayed in LT side building room #6318 which was closed by dolphins encounter. pros-water slide, dolphins encounter, free play station, free dvd, great viewcons- resort it self was huge so need to take tram inside of resort. too many birds near by room so wake up at 4am everyday. rude staff- front desk staff is ok but pool side staff has horrible manner. theres small cafeteria close by pool which is really expensive . 1 bottle of water is $4. palm size of pizza $14 so bring your own food. ", " The main problem is the place is too spread out. The train that is suppose to transport you from one to the other, is very, very slow. In the morning, only 1 train is running. To get anywhere you have to allow another 25 minutes on to your time. They also have \"boats\" that are suppose to shuttle you around. When we first got there, they were several boats running. By the time we left, there was only 1 boat running. There were suppose to be multiple boats running at the same time. We knew that there wasn't a beach, that this was built on a rocky shore. So, that wasn't a surprise. What was a surprise is that there really is no shady area around the pools. PROS- it is a lovely place, well landscaped. And the breakfast buffet was very extensive. There is an adult only pool, but it is very small. CONS- It is spread out too much. Getting from one point to another is a lot of walking. If you have a car, use the valet. It will save you walking another 2 or 3 city blocks when ever you want your car. ", " My husband and I went there for a romantic vacation but what we got was a overpriced underwhelming experience. There were loud screaming kids everywhere and made it impossible to enjoy any of the amenities. We were charged to get our room closer to the front door, for self parking, and for the resort fees that included the internet that didn't work. The beds where cheap, hard mattresses with simply a flat sheet on top.The shower was dirty. The Lagoon was dirty and the animals where sparce because of the loud unruly kids screaming and chasing them.There was never a time that wasn't loud, underwhelming and frankly overpriced. As an example, Coffee for two was $18-20 a day. The \"nice\" restaurant was equivalent to a $20 a plate steakhouse, but minimum prices where $50 range. Non alcoholic drinks where $17-20 each. In the future we will stay in Kona at a cheaper nicer place and not get screwed by overpriced chaos. ", " The property has a ton. Lagoon to swim in, dolphins, pools, spa, places to eat, etc. The issues I have with the property are as follows. Overall the tram is too slow and if you need to get around quickly it almost impossible. I couldn't find a way from our room to the lobby without a ton of stairs and bridges. It is very scenic, however. Now maybe just something that happened to us. Someone can in our room went through a bag to find my daughter's credit cards. They then used them on site. This all happened within 3 hours of us checking in. When we told security. We had to fill out the report. The security person is not allowed to write on the form. There has been little to no follow up. I felt like this was not a big deal to them. Now the security person asked if we had the \"do not disturb sign\" hanging. We did not. We were told by the security guard that if we had the sign hanging outside our door no one would come in. Seriously that where thieves draw the line? They will not disregard a do not disturb sign. I'm not upset the cards got taken. I'm upset with the lack of real concern by Hilton. The security person sorry this happened to you once. ", " Just came back from Big island. Things that bothered us1. Running out of towels every day. Literally you have to have a towel strategy to make sure you have towels when you need them2. Not able to get seating near the pools. So overcrowded that you may not get space on weekends. Also certain parts are reserved for \"more $\". We didn't know when we booked this hotel3. Facilities are neglected. They need to invest $4. No real beach. ", " Service was not present at the hotel - not enough towels, poor room quality, do not get placed in the Island tower very old, not clean and too far away from everything on resort. Overall the experience was not special due to lacking service. Grounds and ocean is beautiful. We will not be returning. ", " construction noise un bearable after 65,000 points they put me in a old room..all of the ocean view are in need of cleaning n remodeling..when mention they weren't as nice as a days in they said they would soon be remodeled for time shares..lot of good that did me.. ", " For the price of this hotel/services/food they don't make you feel like you have gotten your money's worth. There are lines everywhere. When they only run 1 tram it's like it doesn't even exist unless you want to wait 15 min (Around 24min if you just miss it) for the next ride. Also the boat runs at the same time as the tram it seems...If they staggered the times it would be much better.Also was told incorrectly there was no late check-out when I called. They said I had to call the same morning I want it to receive it. I heard 6 others in my group got it for 2pm so I went to the front desk and they could only give me 1pm (Still better than nothing but made checkout with a group a nightmare)The location is also not ideal...Unless you want a mini-mall style shopping you have to drive a long way for some local businesses. ", " Arrived at hotel on Monday, February 13. Asked to be in the renovated building (Palace Tower) which the room was nice...till we found the roach crawling across the TV. Hotel offered comp Breakfast coupons. And thank goodness they did. Big Island Buffet is $32 per person and not worth $9.95. Headed to pool that was freezing cold. Then went to Lagoon Grill and had a beer and an order of Onion rings. Went and laid by the Lagoon Pool and about an hour later both myself and travel companion got violently sick. Like it was coming out both ends. We were in our room from Tuesday at 3pm until Wednesday at 11am. Finally had enough strength to walk to Front Desk. When I mentioned Food Poisoning desk clerk said we would have to fill out a security report...which we did. Hotel would not give us a late checkout. We did leave at 1pm and barely made it to our condo where we did not leave until Saturday for fear of being to far from a bathroom. Have never been contacted by anyone from the hotel and no compensation of anykind for getting sick. We are confident it was the food hotel as we travelled together and had the same thing Monday on the plane over, as well as Breakfast on Tuesday morning. So sad to spend this kind of money on a resort and end up on your bathroom floor for 24 hours and nothing from the hotel. Oh, and there are no vending machines so when you want to try and get a Sprite or Ginger Ale at 3am....yeah...no such luck. Great plans and what was supposed to be a great start to our vacation was ruined. Not what I expect from a Hilton Hotel. ", " Our first trip to Hawaii, and we were so excited to spend a week here (a bucket list item). We traveled 15 hours from the East Coast only to arrive at a very old resort that had no \"wow\" factor. After waiting 15 minutes to check in, they told us we would be in the Ocean Tower (farthest from the parking lot). I explained my husband would be scuba diving and taking a heavy duffle of equipment back & forth every day. They said we could move to the Palace Tower for an additional $245 PER NIGHT!!! We stayed in the Ocean Tower & it hasn't been updated in many years (built in 1988). The elevators were so smelly I had to hold my nose (mildew). We got to the room only to find no microwave, toaster, or regular coffee pot! The refrigerator was a mini with a frozen over freezer. We gad to go out for breakfast/coffee every day. You will pay $5 for coffee. One of the restaurants was closed for renovations, the tram broke for 2 days, and there was nothing outside of this resort unless you drive for 25-30 minutes! The Kona Pool doesn't serve food -- what pool bar only serves drinks? Beer is $7-8/each and mixed drinks are $11-12. We won't be back. Aloha Hawaii! ", " Booked what I thought was the best view in the hotel, ocean front in the ocean tower. At check in was worried we were across from an elevator. The lady said no those are stairs. Asked her if it was a nice room she wait a very nice room. You decide based on the picture. (This is the view from our lanai). Contacted the manager on duty (Hector). No call back. Contacted the concierge she contacted Hector he did call back. Apologized for the room said we should have been told at check in. No, not at all. We should have been told when we made the reservation months ago or as soon as it became apparent this would be happening during our stay. Offered to reduce rate on just the first night and give us 2 entrees. We Wanted to move to a different room. He said ok it was hard to juggle (we are here for 4 nights). Would call us back. I said we did not want to just wait around wanted to unpack would it be within 20 to 30 minutes. He said it would. After 30 minutes we were fed up just unpacked. He finally called back after 45 minutes and said he had a couple of rooms to show us. I said I'm not interested anymore, just reduce the rate on the room. We'll see what he does. Completely mishandled. We've been Hilton honors members for 15+ years never ran into anything like this. Extremely disappointed ", " Recently, the hotel changed hands and the changes have not been positive. They shut down the boats, which was a charming way to get around the large property. They stopped heating the pool so it's fridgid in the winter months. They cut down a bunch of trees where the local Hawaiian birds used to roost. They have not improved or expanded the dining selections and instead, have eliminated the Kama 'Aina rate for the locals. They have not improved the poor lighting around the property, or reduced the exorbitant parking fees. In all, the hotel has lost it's \"Aloha\". A big disappointment from what it once was. ", " Checked into an Ocean Front suite with balcony on the top floor. We checked in late afternoon so we were anxious to sit on the balcony and enjoy the sunset. As we opened the sliding glass door we were greeted with sights and sounds of an enormous Komatsu digger. That remained our view for the entire 3 night stay. The sounds of the digger were limited to 8:15AM to 4:30PM. Not good for any couple looking to sleep in one morning . I'm a Hilton Gold member but that didn't help when I requested a different room. My biggest disappointment was Not being notified of the construction before the trip or even at check in. That type of customer service is unacceptable. Instead of spending a fortune for an ocean front suite, we would have simply downgraded so we didn't see construction equipment all day, everyday. We will not be back to this resort. ", " The only beach resort I've ever visited that doesn't provide full length beach towels. They are barely the size of a bath towel, and come out of a kiosk machine. The tram broke for 2 to 3 days. I was told only 2 boats work, so most of them sit idle in the ocean tower while you make the half mile walk to the lobby. At one time it took less than 5 minutes by tram or boat.The extravagant Kona pool waterfall no longer works, I was told the pump broke.The shower control knobs in our room were loose and moved away from the wall. This caused vibrating when we took showers.Construction is abound throughout the resort. I was never informed of this prior to checkin. They have a sign warning you to avoid breakfast between the hours of 7:30AM to 10:30AM. If you show up at that time, expect an extra long wait. Are you kidding me?Traveling to Hawaii is very expensive. Thousands of dollars are spent by the time you add in airfare, car rental, food and hotel. No to mention the planing that is involved to travel there from the US.Hilton Diamond status does come with privileges at this hotel, I was placed in a room with constant jack hammering and saw cutting. Construction vehicles beep throughout the day. Bliss?They must be updating their phone system, as it now takes 10 to 15 minutes for the operator to pick up the phone. Probably installing new wires?I truly wish they would rebrand this hotel as a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. I think my expectations would then meet their efforts.I have visited this hotel for years, this is by far the most disappointing trip ever. Unless significant improvements are made to the transportation and resort, I will no longer visit this hotel. They should rebrand this hotel. The resort is run like a desperate amusement park with concession stands masked as restaurants. A dolphin interaction is offered for a hefty price. Shade and a chair will cost you. ", " I could not be more unhappy with my experience at this hotel. I was made to understand that some major changes have recently taken place and they seem to be to reduce services for your guests without reducing costs. I had requested a call in the even that a suite became available in our chosen tower. A few days before arrival while vacationing on another island I received a call from Ginger stating that a beautiful suite had become available for $750 a night. Our budget dictated around $500-$600 a night but Ginger urged us to go with this room as it was normally around $1,400 a night and overlooked the dolphins. After hesitating due to the price we decided to splurge on this occasion as Ginger assured us we would not regret it. At check out we get a bill showing our initial rate of $450 a night plus an additional nightly fee of $750. I could not believe my eyes! In no way did agree to an additional charge of $750 a night. We agreed to a total fee of $750 a night. Thankfully, the manager adjusted the total to reflect the quoted price of $750 per night. I am glad I did not have to go through my credit card company to get the correct price. I would never have booked a room at this hotel had I known there would be no kids club. Just days before arrival I had searched on the net for information about the kids club hoping to find specific activities to plan our vacation. I thought it was odd that I could not find the weekly calendar however there was still information about having a kids club at this hotel when doing a Google search. Our hotel room also listed a kids club in the informational folder at the desk in our room. I felt completely deceived by this. Your company should have sent me an email or had an official notice on the website stating that the kids club was no longer available at the hotel. I would have switched to another hotel on the island with a kids club. Our family does not ever stay at hotels without kids clubs and this had a major impact on our vacation. Another issue I have with the hotel is lack of shade available for guests. The only way to get shade at this hotel is to pay for it by renting chairs with an umbrella. That is completely unacceptable to me! And while our family stayed in the Makai section of the hotel and had a private area I found it highly tacky to make portions of the resort unavailable to all paying guests. This was a huge turn off for me and another reason I would not come back to this resort. Next, there were at least a dozen occasions this hotel missed out on doing business with our family as your venues were constantly closed. We saw many, many other families disappointed at the closed facilities as well. The pool bar closes as 5pm, the market place by the pool closes at 4pm, the coffee shop closes very early, the Japanese restaurant did not bother to even open on a Monday (it was a busy HOLIDAY!!!) night, the fish pipe had ridiculously short hours of operation, and the restaurant near the dolphins closed very early too. Each one of these business missed multiple opportunities to make money from our family as well as many other families. We witnessed this on many occasions. It was also an inconvenience that left a bad taste in our mouths. The quality of food at the restaurants is also really lacking. In 2017 I would expect menus with a much more modern offerings. The Italian restaurant and Mexican restaurant are embarrassments to your establishment. Thankfully, the bar near the entrance is on par with what I would expect in this day and age and KPC is a lovely restaurant we found ourselves eating at for decent food and drinks. There is a zero chance I would recommend this hotel to anyone. While it is absolutely gorgeous and well maintained the lack of hospitality at this hotel gives an air of poverty and low class vibe. I am now weary of Hilton in general and will think twice before booking with this brand in the future. ", " It takes me 12 minutes of fast walking to go from my room to my self parked car (0.8 miles). It's frightening to leave your room-don't forget anything! This place is huge! Perhaps fun with little ones, but not with a 16 year old. After experiencing real Hawaii, this place sucks. It's like a massive suburbia experiment gone wrong. I'll never be back, nor stay at another Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton, etc. One can do so much better! ", " The grounds are beautiful. But we were looking for a more Hawaiian atmosphere, not Asian. A few art pieces were Hawaiian(there are a lot all over the grounds and building). But if you want a truly Hawaiian experience, this is NOT the place. We passed on the luau after seeing the place it was held, basically a concrete pit with a stage. There is not a sandy beach ocean-side. Garbage in the man-made waterways. Parking was expensive. It was all-around noisy. Restaurants on the grounds were expensive and nothing we couldn't have found on the mainland. We cannot recommend this place to anyone. All-in-all, it was extremely overpriced for any resort experience. And this place may have cured us of resorts all together! ", " We stayed at HGV which allows for the use of the facilities! There is a shuttle other was its $27.00'a day to park. The lagoon smelt really bad, service at the pool was really poor! The \"beach\" onsite was terrible no ability to sit or lay on the beach!

They have 1300 rooms but they can't find a room to move you to when you get an old broken smelly bad room, dirty windows. When you book on their official website they will not help you understand in any way that the 'ocean tower' is the darkest oldest 2.5* rooms, while the palace and lagoon towers are newly renovated. You'll book not knowing that. And as a Diamond member you'll find yourself in the most outdated broken smelly room. So many things were broken in our room. Shower, phone, all broken. Low water pressure. Dark room, weak lights, very depressing. I expect them to move a guest to a different room when this happens, especially when it's 1300 rooms resort. As for the long lines in the front desk: they will tell you that you can do a zip-check-out over the phone, but that is ridiculous since this service asks you to state that you have seen the bill and accept the charges. But how could you see the bill? Unlike other properties they don't email it to you. You would be able to see it within a few days after check-in on the app. The towels felt older than the room. You want a concierge service with good tips for the island trips? The concierges here are actually salesmen for Grand Vacation time share by Hilton. Some mornings, as HHonors guests the full breakfast is free and some days only the continental breakfast is free and you need to pay for the full breakfast. Anyway I admit that the room issue is effecting the entire experience and review here. With a good new room this hotel can be a fun. If you like huge ones, it's impressive and full of options. I'll start at the beginning: lines at the front desk took 20-25 minutes wait so when you have a problem and need to talk to them during your stay you're once again in trouble. I stay around 100 nights a year at hotels due to my work so I can compare to the incredible customer service improvements at the Hilton chain in recent years. Although we're Diamond members they did put us in an Extremely old dated room, smells and feels like the cheapest version of a 70s best western that hasn't been renovated since. Most of the Hampton inn's would look better than the room the call here 'executive ocean front' and put Diamond members in. My tip: never agree to stay at the ' 'ocean tower'. Go to the palace tower where the rooms are terrific or the Lagoon tower Makai which get a more exclusive treat with a private cool pool etc. What else? There is no beach at this resort. Only artificial small beach. And, there's nothing relaxing about this property. It's a noisy busy tasteless artificial Vegas style village. They don't answer the customer service phone line. If you do catch them and ask for a service, it's not done. They don't recognize the loyalty to Diamond members. They'll still put you in the oldest room. Although hey have 1300 rooms. And although this is a HUGE monster complex of building, when you ask to change a room they will not make an effort. Lines at front desk are so long. It takes 20 min sometimes to get from your room to breakfast of front desk even when you take the train. Imagine you're trying to check out and need to wait for a train for 25 min just in order to get from your room to the entrance. And I've been to huge hotels here before (like the grand hyatt kauai or four seasons maui) but didn't feel this crowded vegas atmosphere). And I don't appreciate them putting live dolphins in a pool for entertainment. I'v stayed in the past at many Hawaiian resorts. Some are relaxing and incredibly beautiful even if they are huge conferences location as this one. If you are a family, not looking for anything romantic, but need a huge mall next door and if you're not into beaches but pools, this intense place might be good for you, the kids will appreciate the train and boats between buildings. Breakfast was very loud and crowded. Wide selection but simple. The Italian restaurant had a poor selection of wine. They are a theme park, not a luxury hotel. But as a theme park with no beach they do a poor job even when it comes to entertaining. The spa is large with steam room and jacuzzi and sauna but outdated too. I do appreciate the choice of vegetables and fruits at breakfast. This is not an obvious thing. Our friends stayed at the Palace tower where the rooms are really nice. I can just guess that the hotel is planning a complete renovation of the huge ocean tower as well, which will make the property much nicer and relaxing. It doesn't change the fact that they should have let me know at the time of the reservation what I should expect. I believe this was unfair.  ", " If you like losing an hour or more of your day to use the onsite transportation, love stairs without handrails, poor food choices at high prices and a setting more devoted to impressing it'self rather than it's guest..this might be the spot for you.

And I will be looking else where for a brand that actually is interested in efficiencieand guest experieince ", " The room was old, outdated and had a dusty smell to it. We slept with the patio door open. If you want a clean, fresh and modern room, this is not the place to vacation. You have to ask to have the sheets changed otherwise they just make the bed. I hid the conservation card so there was no confusion that I wanted fresh sheets each day. Two towels. You have to ask for more. They are quick to respond if you have an issue but vacation is about someone else remembering the details. The birds were loud. My spouse got up to close the door each morning. Between the smell and the loud birds, rest was sparse. The furniture was stained and dirty. They promised a deep clean but I did not see a difference. I cleaned the countertops and the patio furniture. I honestly think they forgot to clean the room before our arrival. If you are fussy about a clean room, check the room before you unpack. ", " The Hilton Waikoloa Village is an impressive building complex, but the standard is 80s, the restaurants are overpriced without appropriate quality (try restaurants outside the resort: better and cheaper). Summarizing: Quality and price-performance-ratio is bad!The most annoying thing is that Hilton Waikoloa Village has debited the credit card more than a month later with the fourfold of the invoiced amount I have paid when checked out.That unacceptable!In addition there is no response reagarding the complaint, inspite of several request.Poor business behaviour. ", " First, we stayed at the ocean tower and it sounds like a jungle in the morning. The smell is unbearable too once you go outside your room. It smells like marijuana and I hated it. Second, they charged my stay not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Unbelievable!! I gave them my credit card to pre-authorize it. I gave them my bank card when I checked out and they charged it twice. The place is great but after getting through this problem, I would never go back to this place and would never recommend it to anybody. ", " We stayed over thanksgiving. We booked an ocean view room in the ocean tower. When we arrived we found they were doing extremely loud jackhammering construction all day directly in front of our room. We had to argue repeatedly with the staff to get moved to another room (they kept try to move us to the conference center, or a room which had an interior view instead of an ocean view). After the trip when we complained they offered us 5,000 points and said it was worth $500 which is a blatant lie because their own site says a $285 room costs 50,000 of their points. They claimed the construction was 'emergency' and they had no time to alert guests...another self-serving lie. Enormous construction equipment does not appear overnight, it has to be scheduled. If we'd had even a few days notice we could have rebooked somewhere else. ", " Overpriced, noisy, crowded. Hilton uses this property to lure potential buyers to purchase vacation property. They are trying way too hard. Save your money. You can get better value even with AirB&B. We work way too hard for out money! ", " We were very dissatisfied with this hotel. Four out of five employees were rude. The food and the food options were awful. If you're going to enjoy yourself be careful all the bars close very very early except for one. There is only one option available for breakfast and it's a bad buffet that is so overly priced it's crazy. Also if you do decide to go here you should call and make sure what's open and what's not open what's available and what's no longer available. And also how much construction is going on I would rate it a 1out of 5 ", " 1. OVERALL RESORT: Fair. The resort itself is quite large, something like 65 acres with lots of pools, waterfalls, and beautiful landscaping set to the backdrop of a rocky, unswimmable beach. While the resort itself was nice, the maintenance of it leaves something to be desired. The bathroom in the waterfall pool area was overflowed and the sewage water was going everywhere, include where people walk and swim in the nearby pools in Makai Tower. Disgusting. The tiles had mold just about everywhere except the boring adults only pool in Ocean Tower. We hardly were ever able to get clean pool towels late in the day, so this was a bit of a nuisance consider they also never put enough towels in the room. The advertised \"heated\" pools are freezing cold. 2. OVERALL SERVICE: Very Poor. This resort had what appeared to be some of the most disgruntled, unhappy employees I have ever seen anywhere. The service was often rude, rushed, and of low quality. Do not even expect Hilton level service here, think more of the Motel 6. The best part of service was the ability to text your needs to the hotel, to which most of the time they take care of things quickly.3. FRONT DESK: Okay. She asked us if we wanted to pay $40 more for an upgrade to the newly renovated Palace Tower. We told her we were celebrating our baby moon, and Sam gave us a room with now view. What was the point of this upgrade? To stare at the lawn and the back of some building?4. GUEST ROOM: Good. Palace Tower has newly renovated rooms, but they are nothing special. A room with one king bed, with two people apparently only gets one bath towel a night. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was spacious. The bathroom needs a renovation--while it was clean, the layout was lame, very poor amenities, and a dingy unwashed shower curtain. High powered air conditioning worked very well.5. RESTAURANTS: Very Poor. Every single restaurant was horrible. Why? Because the quality of food and service are just awful. Dona and So and So's Italian:The soup was served refrigerator cold, and tasted old. Service was extremely slow as it took us over 1.5 hours to get our food. When it arrived it was literally trash on a plate, and very cold, sticky, gelatinous mess. When I asked for a pasta, no sauce, just plain, the server was extremely annoyed and brought out enough pasta to feed a family of 5. Lounge:Very limited options, although it was edible. The service here was good.Mexican-Hawaiian:Subpar Mexican food, but gets the job done in a pinch I guess. I wouldn't eat at this place unless I was stuck at this dumpy resort.ACTIVITY DESK: Worst. Do not book anything through this hotel. We spoke to a gentleman who \"seemed\" knowledgeable about booking activities, but turned out to be completely full of lies. I explained that I am pregnant and can not participate is particular types of activities. He reassured me it was fine. First activity consisted of a night snorkel to see manta rays. He told us it was a catamaran, very stable. When we arrived there, it was a Zodiac boat that jostled so much I was literally hanging on for my life. Why would he lie about this? He seemed to be familiar with the excursion but misjudged it this badly??Second excursion was 10+ hour trip to the volcano. I insisted that we do a short half day trip since I can't sit in the car or do winding roads for too long. It looked curvy on the map, to which he replied it wasn't the right route and there were many stops, no winding driving, etc. We spent the greater part of 8 hours trapped in a van like sardines. I threw up twice. It was horrible. SPA: ? Who knows, I could never get ahold of anyone long enough to make an appointment. Called on day 1, they said they'd return my call. That didn't happen so I called again, they said they're booked for every time I was available. Instead of trying to work something out schedule wise (like offer their availability) they just said, thanks and hung up.Overall Impression: This hotel deserves little praise. It was a terrible end to an otherwise amazing baby moon. If I can get just ONE person to change their mind about visiting this complete dump of a hotel, I feel it's worth it. I am deeply disappointed that at check out, and throughout the stay I told them how unhappy I was with the amenities, facility, and service, but they just shrugged it off each time. Hilton isn't my favorite brand, but this is very subpar even for Hilton. ", " Pros- Facilities are great, Our kids loved Dolphin Quest, Lagoon, slides and the pools. - Food quality for lunch and dinner good (except breakfast)- Close to Shopping centre and shuttle bus to and fro (a few dollars)Cons- Stayed at Ocean Tower on guest recommendations. Rooms are very dated and felt like 3 star hotel. Supposed ocean view was over the car park, but yes you can look right and you can see the ocean. Not quite what we expected. - Hotel massively understaffed over Christmas. Huge queues at breakfast and had to carry own luggage into reception and collect it from left luggage. No security or anyone there. - Breakfast buffet was over one hour wait on Christmas day. We were told this was due to staff shortage. Food was also disappointing... One morning we arrived at 6.30am to find we had to wait 10mins for breakfast. Nearly missed our excursion- Pools were freezing cold....our kids spent most of the time in the Jacuzzi.- No beach front, just lava rocks. Not obvious when you book. - Large number of day guests and Hilton Grand Vacation guests who swamp the hotel during the day. Don't expect a pool bed after 9am !- Spare bed in the room had unchanged sheets from previous occupant...nice surprise !- Awoken by the wild birds at dawn every morning. Thousands of them descend on the palm trees next to Ocean View Overall, really disappointing hotel. Go for the day and enjoy the facilities (the Dolphins are amazing) but wouldn't recommend staying there.

We ended up going to another resort each day for kids club and tennis. ", " THE WORST Buffet I have ever gone to!I have been to over twenty Hilton Hotels in the past 60 years. Today I took someone to the Hilton Waikoloa Village as a thank you for all their hard work. Both of us are here working so we had no family to spend the day with and I figured as hard as we work we deserved a $211.37 meal. This was a tremendous disappointment and extremely embarrassing for me. The only food that was right was the Coffee, it was served at the right temperature. This \"Buffet\" was miserable, all the food that should have been served hot was cold. When I complained, then they lit the cans under the warmers. The Turkey was over cooked and cold, the Han sliced right there was cold and I'm sure that is the Prime Rib had been hot it would have been better than the fatty, greasy taste it left. The last thing was the Cinnamon Apple Pie, had they actually baked it it might have been good but, I believe they received them frozen, half baked and simply thawed them out and put them out, unsliced, the dough was raw!I am horrified to make this report but no one should have to go through this ever! ", " The Hilton Brand is declining and this hotel along with Hilton Grand Vacations is proof. This could be a good venue for a family with kids if they can get low cost rooms. The food selections are limited. Two choices for breakfast - coffee bar or expensive buffet. Lunch is hot dogs, and hamburgers and limited Mexican food selections . Only one nice dinner location KPC which was excellent. Plan to spend $250 and up for 2. Other dinner options is a Cantina with limited selections and Pizza place. The Ocean Towers is under renovation to create vacation condos so make sure you do not stay in those rooms or you will be dealing with construction noise. The saving grace is the lagoon and pools and the tide-pools on the property.

Guess what? If you want shade by the pool, you have to pay for a cabana. You want a beer? It's $8.00. You want breakfast? Not for under $25 for one person or the buffet is $37 pp! There is NO real beach at this resort - they have a lagoon with a makeshift beach. The closet real beach is about a 30 minute walk. Rooms in the hotel need updating. There is nothing special about the room we stayed in - other than the fact it had an real ocean view - for $500 a night! That includes taxes, resort fees, and parking. Additionally, don't ever think about getting married here. That was a whole other ordeal. Trust me. ", " After some research on TripAdvisor we reserved a deluxe ocean view room in the lagoon tower from Costco Travel. We're big Hilton travelers and are generally pleased with all of their brands, especially Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn. Unfortunately for this hotel, it doesn't even come close to the flagship Hilton brand. Rooms in the \"best\" tower are just okay, every encounter with the front desk was disorganized, and food options on the resort were ridiculously expensive and fall way short of what you'd get at TGI Friday's. Parking seems like highway robbery at $37 per day for valet and $27 for self park. Very expensive business center...$5 to log in to a Windows 2000 PC, $.50/minute, $.50/page printed, $5.00 per fax. Don't forget the $30/day resort fee and taxes on top of it all. Pool facilities are nice but not great (during our stay several pools were closed and all of the water slides were closed). There's no beach access so plan on driving if you want sand and waves. There is a lagoon but it doesn't seem very clean. The dolphin pool is creepy and just feels wrong - it seems too small for a bunch dolphins. Another thing - we clean our cars at home with better towels than what they put in the rooms. On the plus side, staff was super friendly and helpful, but unable to really help resolve any of the shortcoming of the resort.The overall lower quality and mediocre experience would be better if the resort was affordable, but the nearby Fairmont is much nicer and cheaper. So be prepared to spend \"Fairmont\" money for an \"Aston Resort\" experience. Hilton should either renovate this resort or sell it off to Aston or some other budget brand. ", " We arrived 2 hours before check in ,was told we had to wait until 3pm,we did,and still not ready at 3. Were rudely told it's still not ready! Got into rooms at 4:30 pm,and the beds were still not made,handprints on sliding door,long black hairs on couch and bathroom counter- disgusting! Nothing's open in October on the property,advertise everything is and it's not ! So disappointed . Also if you ask staff any questions ,they don't know. ", " The Good things : Amazing grounds, nice amenities onsite, and friendly, helpful staff. Also it seems the resort refunds you the $3.00 ATM service charges (that was not expected).The Bad things : rooms are old and dirty. The elevators smell like feet and have been damaged and defaced with keys or pocket knives. There was some kind of scary animal that has the clear head of a termite and the body of a cockroach. I don't know what it is and if it bites or stings or ???. The resort seems to be suffering from lack of any kind of renovation or maintenance with frequent breakdowns of the train. Room tip : since anyone including the general public can use the amenities and the resort grounds there is no exclusivity to being a registered guest. Registered guests pay more for parking than the public ($30/day) and a ($30/day) resort fee. ", " Very disappointed... loud birds kept us up all night (ocean towers has a circular structure that amplifies their noise). Restaurants are overpriced, $35 per person for a breakfast buffet!? Took 20 minutes of walking to get to the lobby from our hotel room. The tram is even slower than walking. Hotel needs updating. ", " This is a 4+ star property, but I give it just 1 star because of our experience, and because it\u2019s just not what we had expected or wanted from our Hawaiian vacation. We were disappointed from the moment we walked into the lobby and saw the monorail system <sigh>. We might as well have been in Disney World with the huge expanse of property, buildings, kids running around, etc. It took us 30+ minutes from the time we walked up to the check-in counter to the time we got to our room (3 tram stops later). Later in the evening, I got thirsty, only to find nothing in the room frig (no mini bar???) \u2013 but when I thought about the hassle of leaving the room and going to look for something to drink (or worse, try to get to our car to go somewhere), I realized it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle, and it was easier to stay thirsty and dehydrated \u2013 it\u2019s THAT bad. After a coffee (the only \u201crestaurant\u201d that ISN\u2019T a tram ride away is a coffee house in our building), we asked where the beach is \u2013 um\u2026.NO BEACH AT THIS HOTEL! Apparently the ocean front is too rocky and rough, so there\u2019s no access, and your only option is a man-made hotel lagoon or take a shuttle to the beach. Why would anyone come to Hawaii and stay at a place like this with no beach and a property so big you need transportation to get around?? I guess if you are just looking for nice weather and never want to leave, it\u2019s okay. But be prepared to hike to one of the many pools on property, it's no easy stroll - at least from where our room was. It's definitely not the kind of hotel or vacation I\u2019d ever want to stay at again. Fortunately, it was only 2 nights of a 16-day trip, and we had stayed at another property in Kona for 3 nights prior, so we really got to enjoy the area. I should have known better to book a Hilton, but I\u2019ve stayed before at other global-brand hotels where they did a MUCH better job at making it feel intimate and cozy despite their size. I will give kudos to the architects, landscapers, designers and grounds keepers. The place is beautiful, with lush plants and waterfalls everywhere (man-made, of course) and exquisite artwork throughout the property everywhere you look. The room was fine, it was big, clean and overlooked a lot of greenery. But honestly, looking out the window and the feel of the room, we could have been anywhere in the world that\u2019s warm \u2013 it just didn\u2019t give us that wonderful Hawaiian feel we found at other places. Bottom line: we were sorry we wasted two days of our trip here and won\u2019t be recommending it. But as I said in the headline, maybe it works for some people \u2013 just not us. ", " First, we stayed in the newly renovated Palace Tower part of the resort. However, our room consistently smelled like a smoker had lived in it for years. It wasn't a moldy smell, but more like an ashtray that had been air conditioned.Second, I wasn't expecting to find captive dolphins on the property, but I learned that Hilton operates DolphinQuest. It may sound nice as an experience for your kids, but the reality is that these dozen or so bottlenose dolphins are confined to an extremely small pool and get handled by humans every day. It was quite sad to experience.Third, the way the hotel is laid out, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to reach your car from your room. I believe this was a design feature of the resort to keep you locked into the experience. I like to venture out and see other things on my vacations, so this was very off-putting to me.Four, the point about feeling locked in would not be so bad if they had decent restaurants on the property. They are very expensive and mediocre quality. So if you're hoping for fine dining, or decent food at decent prices, you'll probably be disappointed.Five, after a couple days I started to notice the different themes of the hotel. The decorations and art are Italian, Buddhist, Chinese, and very little Hawaiian. It was confusing to me and made the experience feel a bit too fake, but it's subtle enough that you may not notice it. I was hoping for more of a Hawaiian feel since I'm in Hawaii. Assuming none of the things above bother you, you'll probably enjoy it. It's a vast resort, it has a boat taxi, tram, and large pools. It's your typical resort in that sense.One tip regarding parking, valet is only $5 more, so probably worth it, but make sure to call for your car in advance since it takes them 5 to 10 minutes to retrieve your car. Also keep in mind that parking is by the day, not 24 hour periods. So if you arrive at 11 pm at night, and leave at 6 am the next morning, that is considered two days of parking fees. I hope this helps! ", " We were so excited to have a ride on the canal ride with my 10 year old niece who was recently diagnosed with cancer. Not only did it never come, but we kept being told that it was coming but late. we waited 45 mins in the hot sun for nothing. My poor niece nearly fainted from exhaustion. Will NEVER stay here again ", " We arrived here Saturday and were looking forward to our family vacation. This Hilton came highly recommended. We had a very large suite 1500 sq feet and paid over $700 per night. We got to our room and found very bare bones necessary items in the room. There were only 2 towels and 1 shampoo, soap and conditioner. Only 3 styrofoam cupsand in addition this huge suite 2 lamps were broken. Don't expect a decent room service menu. That night I needed to make huge list of things we needed for our stay and don't bother calling no one answers, you need to text your requests. I like a more personal experience when I travel. If your looking for a real beach this hotel does not have one the Fairmont down the road is where you will find the sand. Next day we decided it was best to pack up and leave and move hotels. My husband went to talk to them and ask for a early check out they said ok, no questions asked. They really don't care about why their guest want to leave. ", " I came here for a conference so the visit was forced a bit. First I have to say that all the staff were double awesome. As everyone else has said the food is good not great and everything is pricey as expected. But for me the real craziness is there is no beach on the property! I repeat if you want to hang on the beach and tickle the sand you need car and a map. Golf tennis pools are great but I can get that stateside. If I am going to Hawaii I am looking for a beach experience right? ", " Staying at the Hilton Bay Club.We called the ocean activities desk to ask about glow in the dark putting on Friday, as advertised on their website.They assured us it was Monday, Wednesday & Friday, even gave us a last tee time of 7pm. We showed up @ 6:15 Friday, the place is closed. We asked the concierge about it, and they argued with us, saying they don't offer that anymore- even tho we called that very same morning to check. Not impressed with their costumer service.As we were leaving, I almost got run over by a foul mouthed valet driver. He yelled at us, then had the nerve to confront us on the way back to his station. I'd already reported him to his boss, but I'm not ok with almost getting killed so some valet can make more tips. More emails will be sent soon.It only saves you $5 to self park, plus you save a tip.NEVER CHECK YOUR CAR WITH A HILTON VALET DRIVER, his tires were squealing cuz they don't care about your car, or pedestrians.

Since last three days our toilet is getting clogged everyday. Yesterday our door lock stop working and on first day our bathroom was clogged. Our room stinks due to our toilet overflowing. Yet nothing from management. They pretend that this is normal. So if you coming here because pictures over Internet looks amazing don't get deceived, Go to different hotel. Also this hotel does not have beach access. Food ver very very expensive and taste terrible. For example a drip coffee (brewed regular) is 6 dollars. ", " Just last week my wife and myself visited the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii from August 10th \u2013 15th , 2016. We flew from New York to Hawaii for our honeymoon and stayed in the Ocean Tower (Room 5022). I felt it very necessary to write and share our horrific, poor service and unexpected experience at the Hilton. The name Hilton carries such a status, that it\u2019s hard to believe you have employees in Hawaii at your location who make customers feel un-welcomed. Your main bartenders (male) working the Kona pool bar need customer service training. They were very short with conversing, unwelcoming and bothered from the time they opened to when they left. It was so bad, I sent my wife to the bar to order and she experienced the same rude and poor service. So disturbing that we ended up leaving the Kona pool side and going directly to the front desk and informing management (Jesse). This is what I shared with Jesse as I had reached my boiling point with the quality of customer service being received while on my honeymoon and also, booked through Hilton Grand vacations. 1. Kona Pool bartenders (males) were all rude, unprofessional, uninviting, unwelcoming and unaware that a personality is probably required to do your job effectively.2. Kona Pool towel section representative informed myself and my wife at one point last week that they were short staff and out of clean towels (by 10:00am) and if we wanted towels to call management and complain. Is this standard practice?3. Tours & Activities representative (Laverne) who was working at the section by Gym and Spa was also very rude and unwelcoming as well. I was inquiring of a charter fishing activity and it was not much she knew or could or did want to explain. Left me completely baffled. (How are these folks trained?)Sad part is there was absolutely NO convincing my wife that purchasing a Hilton Grand vacation timeshare was going to be a good investment. Regardless of what I said or what was stated and presented to us during our tour, she was not sold on the fact that this customer service was just a fluke or one-off. This visit and experience had left such a bad taste in her mouth that she couldn\u2019t wait to leave and visit Maui. I honestly expected more from Hilton, from the Hilton brand and from our very first trip to Hawaii. I\u2019ve never had such piss-poor customer service or and unwelcoming feeling ever in my life. This was a complete fail and although Jesse did have another employee contact regarding the charter fishing activity, I still feel as if Hilton failed. Completely missed the mark. There was only one bright moment from the 5-day stay at the Hilton and that was due to Wendy and Dahlia at Lagoon Grill. Dahlia overheard me and my wife chatting about our poor and horrible experience to another couple and went completely out of their way to show us how folks in Hawaii typically treat visitors\u2026tourist. These two women should have plagues at the entrance displaying worker of the month. They both apologized over and over and did all they could to make our remaining stay fun. We speak more about them than we do the overall experience. They made us smile and spoke highly of Hawaii, the people and even the hotel. Management really needs to conduct their own investigations or simply inquire with other guest. This was horrible. Again, this was a huge fail on behalf of the Hilton. Your workers represent that brand every day. I\u2019m disappointed and appalled by the poor customer service and unwelcoming feeling experienced during my honeymoon. I actually have been managing teams (command center, help desk, customer support) for over 10 years now and this should never happen. Huge fail. Where's the Aloha???? ", " The complex is so crowded that it makes you forget the good features of the property. It was like Walmart on Black Friday every day of our 4 day stay. We were elbow to elbow in the main pools. Really. We stopped using them. Waterslide lines were so long we gave up. The valet took 20 - 40 minutes to get car. No room service. Hilton keeps adding more buildings and rooms, but the common facilities can't keep up with crowds. Only good part of stay was our room, which was a two room suite with 1.5 baths. I have Hilton Gold status but this is a Hilton I will never return to. ", " terrible outdated, dirty, everything was far no music in pools hard to get from. I would not recommend this place. It was inconvenient nothing was walking distance as far as eating. Every restart was hot ", " This hotel is outdated. The rooms are old and take forever to walk to. There is a tram you could take but it is so slow moving and came around every 15 minutes. The food was horrible and way over priced. We ordered room service: 2 beers, a pizza, and a quesadilla for $85 and it took over an hour. The food at this establishment was the worst food we had in Hawaii. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone going to The big island..there isn't even a beach!! I stayed at the Fairmont a few nights before and I highly recommend staying there instead. ", " This hotel had many different issues. First off, many pieces of the resort are old, outdated, and dirty (such as the elevators). Secondly, we were waiting at least an hour to get into our room when we arrived because the lock was broken and needed to be replaced. Finally, the resort closed the entire main pool area to the hotel guests TWICE (Monday and Friday) for a private event. This was horrible treatment to their guests who are forced to pay a resort fee. Would not recommend this hotel. ", " There are not enough lounge chairs on the property and people are taking chairs and towels from other people. This is causing people to get into fights and ruining vacations. Management did nothing about this problem during our stay. If you want a chair make sure you rent one at a cost of around $100 a day. And make sure you rent they way in advance. Also, the hotel has slowed down the transportation within the hotel and the wait times are longer than in previous years. We always planned 30 min to get from our room to the lobby. We have been going to this hotel for at least 30 years but maybe it's time to start looking around at other hotels. Walking around in fear of being verbally attacked by crazy people stealing pool chairs and towels is not the way we would like to spend our vacation. ", " Just arrived today and got a room where a/c is not working. Tried to call front desk 4 times within 30min but no answer. Called to operator 3 times and each time they said that engineer is coming but nobody came to fix a/c. Last time they promissed to call back but no call. After 1,5h I decided to go the front desk and explained the whole story and said that I should get some compensation for all this hassle. The guy in the front desk said that \"you got a room where a/c is working, that is your compensation, next customer!\". I'm really dissapointed to the service and rude attitude of the stuff. Can't recommend this hotel to anybody! ", " Let me start by saying that the property is amazing. There are many things to see and do. However, since I had my children and smaller grandchildren, I was extremely disappointed that there are NO shade umbrellas to be found at any of the pools on the entire property. There are cabanas to rent, but they are expensive and sparsely distributed among the pools.We love the sun and the warmth from the sun, but to stay outside without any protection at all for any prolonged period of time is not practical. One would expect that the Hilton would encourage you to stay at the pool and continue to order food and drink, but that is not the case.I believe it is reasonable to expect at a resort of this caliber and for the price you pay to stay, that there is some shade available rather than just \"paid shade\". If you are vacationing with your family and shade is a requirement at the pool, I would avoid this property. ", " Im a Hilton Honors Member and the upgrade is a joke! Shame on me for not paying attention to the reviews. Shame on Hilton for this run down and dated Hotel. TEAR IT DOWN A START OVER. I AM GIVING UP MY Hilton Honors and Switching to Marriott! I will not ever stay here again even if free! I have 3 more nights and can hardly wait to get out of here! ", " Absolutely insane how much you charge for the water toys at the lagoon. $22 per half hour to rent a paddle board for kids that you can buy at Costco for around $100 etc. Your Dolphin Pen is way too small. Your restaurant choices are way over-priced for the quality of food. The hours of the restaurants are too limited 5-930pm is too restrictive to utilize if you wanted to go! Your prices for coffee and danish's are crazy expensive! There are hardly any fish in your lagoon to see while snorkeling! Parking fees on top of room prices at $275 per night plus resort fees are insane! I spent $3184 just in resort, hotel and parking fees for an 8 night stay! This does not include the money I spent to find out that your food sucks! The only thing I enjoyed food wise were the Fish and Chips at the lagoon and at the Luau which was the only money I spent while there that I didn't feel cheated on!Honestly, this stay was the worst experience I've ever had at a Hilton in my 51 years! There is no way that your resort is worth half of what I spent to be there! I spent well north of $4000 during my 8 days there plus airfare to get there and I was severely disappointed with my stay! Guessing by how many boats were in the docks and the fact that the one you were using was rarely full, I'm sure it's safe to say that this resort has a very low occupancy rate. I understand why! You guys have a lot off issues to address before I ever start thinking about spending another dime there again! ", " Generally the grounds were beautiful but challenging for elderly and children to get around. Resort felt like they wanted to squeeze every dime out of you during your stay instead of creating a positive environment of aloha and vacation. As a vignette, in the matter of 1 hour, 2 members of my party (my wife and my nephew with same last name) were refused room keys despite ID. Mind you front desks to literally 0.5 mile from your room or pool. My 6 yo and 16 yo well behaved daughter and neice were run off from the the slide bc the attendant was being so controlling and abusive of other children (who were also doing nothing wrong). Security was called to let my 16yo nephew in the room (bc they wouldn't give him a key) and after over 45 minutes security still had not shown up so housekeeping let him in (likely against the rules!). Then 3rd party pool contractor saw an open insulated grocery bag (that u get from any grocery store these days) holding nothing but pool toys and a camera that was sitting open next to our pool chair. The contractor demanded to know who it belonged to (\"who does this cooler belongs to\" (loudly across the pool where we were swimming). She told us this pool bag (her words cooler) wasn't \"allowed in the pool area.\" When I told her it was not cooler - it was a pool bag - which we travel with routinely. She said well it's not allowed \"I don't work for Hilton, I am a contractor, I am just enforcing their rules.\" Because of our scandalous empty pool bag \"cooler\" security came to talk to us. Nice security guy but a pathetic excuse for a vacation when a pool attendant is chasing me and my 6 yo daughter out of the pool to demand to know why i brought pool toys to the pool in a scandalous insulated bag! That same pool attendant could have made great money for Hilton had she instead showed up and offered us a menu for smoothies and snacks. This was just the tip of the iceberg from 1 hour of 1 day. All I saw all day long at the pool was folks being told they couldn't eat that bag of chips or that bottle of soda they had (even if they bought it at the hotel). The women next to me had to \"relinquish\" their bag of chips. Ridiculous. By employing folks to serve only the purpose of roaming the pool and lagoon for \"infringements\" instead of offering customers service, Hilton is losing a colossal amount of customers and income. No one is sitting by the pool drinking or eating like you usually see at a resort because there is no one to serve it or make it a fun idea. This doesn't even include our debacles trying to find dinner with mysterious opening and closing hours across restaurant conflicting between room paperwork and restaurants that are nearly a mile apart from each other. And there no signs to direct you. This place needs a huge culture shift!!! Then think about a renovation. ", " We have been staying at this property for over 20 years. This hotel used to treat guests special, & Honors members would have complimentary breakfast & a lounge with light snacks & refreshments in the evening. Not anymore. It seems like the management philosophy has changed. The service has declined significantly in just the last 5-6 years. There are no special welcomes. Housekeeping was awful. Garbage cans were dirty & general cleaning of rooms weren't done (we had a suite and a regular room). The pool & ocean lagoon management (run by Ocean Sports) has reduced the number of chairs for guests & charges for the cabanas. When asked if I could bring a chair to the shade the Manager of Ocean Sports replied,\"if you want shade, you can rent a cabana for $60.\" Perhaps this is a way for them to reduce costs - less chairs to maintain & organize at the end of each day. Grand Vacations Club has several timeshares at the edge of the property& guests are allowed to use the facilities - naturally there are now more guests using the areas. But families come into the lobby in bathing suits without covers and dragging coolers. ", " My family accompanied me to a conference in April. It started our fine. It is a beautiful place with magnificent rooms. Everyone was nice, at first. The third day, my son was swimming in the pool and went down a waterslide. The water was WAY too shallow and he landed on his ankle on the bottom of the pool. From then on, we were treated horribly! They gave us a wheelchair to use, but we could not get anywhere. The tram took FOREVER and it was extremely difficult to get on and off. We had to cancel swimming with the dolphins and the kids club because they were not wheelchair accessible. One day I pushed my son down to the lagoon grill (everything was a very long walk) and was forced to walk through another conference. The ONLY way down to the lagoon was to go through a reception that a bankers conference was holding. It was horrible! Then once at the grill, I had two mothers come up to me asking how I was getting around because their children had wheelchairs and they had to be carried everywhere. Otherwise they stayed in their rooms.When we asked security for crutches they said they couldn\u2019t risk the liability and hung up on us. Shame on you!!!If I wasn\u2019t there for work, we would have left right away. My son NEVER wants to go back to Hawaii and has told everyone we know how horrible Hilton is because he was treated like he did something wrong. Seriously! My 10 year old son asked me why people (staff) were being so mean to him. I felt awful. I can\u2019t imagine how this resort has been around so long and gotten away discriminating against people who need accommodations. Lastly, when I tried to complain and tell management about our experience, I was told someone would call be back. The never did! I had writing bad reviews, but in this case, I feel it is the ONLY way to tell my story since NO ONE would talk to me. ", " This resort I had high expectations for and quite excited to stay at. We stayed in the ocean tower with ocean front view. We found hair all over the bathroom walls upon arrival. I really hoped it would be cleaned throughout our stay but it wasn't. Maybe we should've complained but whatever. I swear our room was \"cleaned\" by simply making the bed. DO NOT go to KPC it has an amazing view but you will be treated extremely poorly and the food is very poor to say the least. ", " The hotel is old, our room was old, far from the kids pool (over half a mile). The hotel was fairly empty but when we called to see if they could get us anywhere closer to the kids pool, they basically told us we hadn't paid enough. The staff is anywhere from unhelpful to downright rude. The valet will hound you to move your car even if you are actively unloading your children. They won't offer to help you with anything. ", " Fresh blood on sheet and housekeeping supervisor argued that it was old. It was Red blood! This supervisor argued with me, spoke down to me and disregarded my concerns that I had been sleeping on a bed with freah blood that wasn't mine! When did it become ok to argue and belittle guests? Management made a few calls to my room while I was out, but otherwise DID NOTHING. DO NOT STay Here!! ", " Wow, where to begin...checked in, tipped front desk $20, then or luggage was stat to another room, took several hours to get. Room was literally about 1/2 mile away. There's a tram, what? Felt like we were at Disneyland. Oh and the slowest and coldest tram ever. Ended up walking because you can walk faster and the thing had no schedule so you never know when it'll b there..huh? alternative, boats spewing gas fumes..nice. feral cats all over the property. No sheets on the beds, just a blanket, very few towels, no ipod hookup to listen, no hot water ever and the tub was so slippery we each almost fell twice.Restaurants....RIDICULOUSLY overpriced and the staff for breakfast...kooky is one way to describe. Never could get a cup of HOT coffee after asking over and over, secret commenting on weekday I was ordering, one day a little glass of juice, next day 26 oz glass of juice??? Mind boggling. Ordered a margarheta pizza thru room service $43 and it was terrible, how do you screw that up?? I could go on and on but I have to save my energy to walk the walk to get to my car which is about a mile away.Nevertheless, would NOT, EVER visit again. Paris Hilton should be ashamed, she definitely wouldn't be caught dead here. ", " So let's begin with my reservation I specifically requested two queen beds in my room upon arrival we received two double beds and of course they added $50 per night on to give me what I ordered to begin with. I had no choice but to pay I asked if I could just cancel and go to another hotel but again they wanted to charge me. So I agreed to the charge and we get a descent room then...... We all wake up in the morning and the shower has no hot water so my entire family of four had to cold shower yea :(. The next day we decide to drive to the volcano (2 hour drive each way) so after hiking and having a great time there we return at 10 pm to no sheets on our bed?????? So two exhausted kids calling the front desk waiting for sheets so we can go to sleep. The last night we were here my son (ten years old goes to the ice shop by the pool and he has a free ice cream coupon and asks the woman for a cone and she says no I closed two minutes ago he kindly tells her that the tram took forever and he left the room almost 30 minutes ago!! She responds very inappropriately and he returns to the room very upset with tears in his eyes so I walked down there with him and had to get the manager invoked to get this unfortunate situation fixed. Well besides all of those issues the property is terribly designed to get from your room to anything either takes you 15-30 minutes walking or 30-45 to wait for the train? All of the restaurants on property have three stars or less on trip advisor and Yelp so not a good place to eat either? There is absolutely no reason to stay here considering the many hotel options near by! If you follow my reviews you can see that I travel 150 days a year on average and I have this type of experience maybe once a year ", " The grounds are truly lovely, the rooms are truly terrible. Old, not upgraded, noisy--the birds woke us up two or three times a night. Expensive, very poor value. Pools are quite small and nothing very special about them. No ocean beach at this hotel, the Marriott has a beach. This hotel has a lagoon. ", " I stayed for just a day with my family. And from are check in we were met with short snide remarks. Even the coffee shop all I could hear was staff saying they wanted to go home. Wile leaving and waiting for the tram I heard a visitor screaming loadly at a lady in an office. Her in tears and shaking I went in and told him he needed to leave her Twice yet he persisted. So I walked he to a near by conceair desk and ask the lady there to watch out over here but she didn't seem to care. No one came to her assistance This place is odd I don't know what's going on with the staff it needs fixed. So then getting to my car again we felt the old shoulders I would ever stay here again. And feel for others that bring there family's here ", " Extremely disappointed with our stay at this hotel. Came to celebrate my sons 11th birthday. Paid for a full ocean view but was given a partial ocean view with trees blocking what little view we did have. Awoken early morning by a crane and workers right out side our balcony. Restaurants charge a lot but give incomplete meals. Son ordered tacos and got a pile of plain tortilla chips but no salsa or guac. What was he going to do with plain chips. Husband ordered a $28 burger...if he wanted fries they were another $5 extra. They can't throw in some fries for what they charged for a basic burger nothing fancy? The place is HUGE...therefore, they lack in service. I don't mind paying extra, if they take care of you. But this place is all about milking its customers. Would not recommend!! ", " Spent one night here before heading out not a good experience. The room was pretty average but it takes a long time to get anywhere due to the huge size of the resort there is a tram that is fairly irregular and a boat but honestly most of the time it's faster to walk. I found the food to be expensive but fairly good depending on the restaurant. Had lots of problems with what I would consider basic requests for a hotel. When checking out called to have the bags be picked up 3 times after 25 min gave up and carried everything onto the tram. Valet lost our car keys (although they were very apologetic about it it took 20 min to find them) finally had problems with late check out originally they said they couldn't do it but for 50% of one night we could stay 2 hours longer then said we could have 1 hour for free but housekeeping checked about every 15 min from 11:00 till 1:00 to see when we were leaving (check out is at 12:00) overall a bad experience I would not recommend.Finally, I have to say even if this were a fantastic resort which it isn't even close in this day and age I would not feel comfortable, and hope others wouldn't either about supporting a place that keeps dolphins in a shallow and fairly small pool. ", " this place is like a zoo. Horrible services in all means. we signed up for valet parking, but it toke 45min to 1 hr for that one guy at the desk to bring up cars while almost 50 of guests were waiting.We also purchased the breakfast (about $50 each value) thought to buy us some convenience, again, the wait at breakfast was about 1 hr and it was an extremely frustrated experience, the food is no better than a continental breakfast at Holiday Inn.The hotel spreads out so far that you have to take a light rail or boat on resort to get to your room, and the train went down from time to time, we ended up dragging our luggage and run for 20 minutes just to get to lobby.There is no access to the beach, you will have to walk for half an hour, or take a trolley or drive to nearest beach at Marriott... so why not stay at Marriott which is a so much better hotel, nice setting and right at the beach???!! I passed through Marriott and regret I was too loyal to Hilton.The outdoor pool is so far away from the room, you will have to walk at least 10 minutes, that is if you did not get lost. It is tiny, no view of ocean, in the corner between their horrible looking clumsy buildings.We scheduled luxury Mauna Lani Spa, but due to the chaotic at Hilton, we were late by 40 minutes to our spa and it was not refundable. The train was down (again, waited for 20 minutes, then decided to walk to lobby, that took about 25 minutes. Then only found we had to wait for an hour to get car by valet parking. The manager offered Hilton spa but guess what, it is also horrible setting and nothing to compare with Mauna Lani Spa so we declined).It is crowded all the time all over the places. The hotel staff are all very rude and have no patient at all. They do not even provide a bottle of water in the room. The internet was so slow it was almost not usable.I have been traveling a lot and is a member of HHiltons, in last couple of years, I started to notice the Hilton services are getting rapidly degenerated... maybe they hired a lousy new manager or something happens there. Will no longer use Hilton for sure. It completely ruined my vacation by all means. ", " This was our first time at the Hilton Waikoloa. The room was very comfortable and clean with great air conditioning - a must for my family. Beyond that, everything goes downhill. First, quality: the food at every venue we tried was awful, particularly Imari, the resort's Japanese restaurant. Second, price: we expect to pay $$$$$ for island vacations. That said, a small Caprese salad, a Cobb salad with five 1/8\" slices of chicken, a small cheese pizza and two cans of Diet Coke cost $100.64. Dinner for three (teppanyaki without alcohol) at Imari was $241 and was terrible. I don't mind paying for quality, but when I pay $241 for lousy food, I get cranky. We will not be coming back to this resort. Good food is part of the experience, and this place fails. ", " I am not amongst travelers who write bad reviews. Having travelled around the globe, and frequently staying at multiple Hilton and conrad properties worldwide.I must say HILTON WAIKOLOA is a major disapointment.1. WAy to big for any personal service.2. No hint of local hawaiian culture. (property has asian, buddhist art all over the property)3. Very expensive dining options- and very poor in quality.4. extremely poor service- at 400AUD a night you do not even have 24hrs room service. The housekeeping in shody and not even motel standard.5. The hotel needs a major renovation, the rooms are old and tired.(stayed at the ocean tower)6. the distances between the buildings are huge, even though there is a train and a boat they are slow and one has to wait 10-15mins on an average.7. they loose no oppurtunity to charge-think off paying 57 $ for a cabana right under your balcony.8. Valet service is a joke- we had to wait 35mins to get our rental . Much better parking on your own.9. No consideration for the guests- we booked to watch the island dance and eat the local cuisine at the Luau- it was an out door setting- it was pouring rain - the offer was see the show in the rain \"we can offer you a towel\" or u can rebook. Come on HILTON- you are organising a buffet service on a tropical island-charging people 150$/ head and expect them to sit out in the rain and eat in the rain. You have to be kidding me.Overall this has to be the worst resort I have stayed at over the last 20 years of travel. ", " 9 days and 8 nights. Self parking per day was $25, valet was $30. Breakfast was $30 a person. Food quality was okay, but not worth the cost. Left the resort for all other meals due to the outrageous cost. Rooms were very severely outdated, noisy, and were far from plush. No microwave and tiny fridge. Paid an extra $20 a night just to get a partial view of the ocean, waste of money. 15-20 min walk from front to room, or wait 20 min for the TRAM. Tons of families and children so very noisy outside which u can hear in the room starting at 7am. WiFi bandwidth is terrible, dial up speed. No good place for snorkeling. Kona, where everything is, is about 30 min drive which is where we drove to eat all other meals. Took forever for the front desk to pick up the phone when i needed help. I stay frequently at Hilton hotels worldwide because of the typical good quality. Would never stay here again!!!!! ", " My fianc\u00e9 and I arrived this evening for a 6 day/5 night package with the Hilton Grand Vacation club (offered to my fianc\u00e9 due to his Diamond Elite HHonors status). While the check-in process was fairly quick, waiting for the tram to take us to the other end of the resort with all of our luggage was not. Once we finally got to the first room about 30 minutes after checking in, we found that it was unacceptable and certainly not what we expected. They said they \"upgraded\" us to a partial ocean view room on the ground floor. They failed to mention that this \"ground floor\" actually should have been called a basement because it felt like we were in an underground bunker making the trek there. Once there, the room was nothing like we expected: old tile floors, plantation shutters that wouldn't stay closed (therefore, allowing passerbys to see in), and what sounded like a frat party going on two doors down and we could hear EVERYTHING. We asked for a new room. They said they would have someone meet us at a new room with our keys (so we wouldn't have to make the 25 minutes trek back to the front desk). The security guard came 10 minutes later, let us in the new room, but didn't have any keys. We were then directed to the Ocean Tower's Concierge service desk anytime before 10:00 (it was 8:50 at this time) to pick up our new keys. Great, we thought, gives us time to grab some dinner at the cantina. Ha, think again. Because the debacle with the room took so long, the restaurant was closing and wasn't serving anything. They suggested we try the pizza place as it stays open until 9:30. Fine. We go to the concierge desk as we'd been told to do on the way to the restaurant only to find no one is there. We use the phone to call the front desk. We relay our story, they tell us they sent that concierge person away from that desk for the night and that they would be bringing our keys to the restaurant. It took about 45 minutes for us to have dinner and now that the restaurant was closing, we were expecting to have our keys to go to our room after a tiring day. But, no. They had not sent the keys and when my fianc\u00e9 called, he was told \"sorry, we forgot, but we have somebody on the way.\" We sit and wait at the restaurant and a security guard shows up and says \"you need to get in your room\"? We said, \"do you have our keys?\" He said he wasn't told anything about the keys, only to meet us at the restaurant to follow us to our room and open the door for us. At this point, this experience is becoming ridiculously comical due to the obvious lacking in appropriate customer service. My fianc\u00e9 calls BACK to the front desk and is told they would send someone to our room with the keys and to go ahead with the security guard so we could get into our room. This call took place at approximately 10:00pm. When we finally got back to our room, it was 10:10. We waited until 10:30 to call the front desk YET AGAIN because we still didn't have keys. They said someone was on the way. FINALLY, at nearly 10:45pm, we had room keys.Now, I have no doubt this property is beautiful and I'm looking forward to actually exploring it in the daylight considering I'm writing this initial review on the first evening of our stay. HOWEVER, if this is how Hilton treats their Diamond Elite members and how Hilton Grand Vacations conducts their business, then I can tell you we will not be coming back here ever again, nor will we entertain ANY thought of buying into a vacation package. We plan on speaking to a manager and if things don't improve, then this review will stand. IF they do somethings to improve, then I'll increase to a more positive rating.Here's to hoping so. ", " I booked a 7 day, 6 night stay with the Hilton Grand Vacation Club (HGVC) to stay at the HILTON WAIKOLOA VILLAGE HOTEL. This trip has left me with a very bad experience of HILTON HOTELS and the the HILTON GRAND VACATION CLUB. I view the hotel and HGVC as one in the same as they are both part of Hilton.When we checked into the hotel, We had to wait in line 1 HOUR before we were received at the front desk. When we were checking in, we were told they put us into a room with two double beds. We wanted a King; we were told that they could accommodate us with a room with a King, but it would be at an extra cost of either $60 or $100 per night depending if we wanted an ocean view. We chose the lesser cost option. The place appears more like a Disney World hotel in Orlando, not a romantic Hawaii beach resort, which is our style. The room was comfortable, but the walls were thin. We could hear conversation from both of the rooms adjacent to us. We could hear the Luau that was going on. We were awakened at 3 am one morning because of a malfunctioning fire alarm. Not exactly a restful stay.This hotel nickels and dimes you for everything. There is $25 per night charge for parking and a $25 per day resort fee. We had to pay $60 extra for the room with a king size bed. You can get free internet if you are a Hilton Honors member, however the Internet is very, very slow unless you elect to pay $8 per day charge for premium Internet. The food was good, but very pricey. Since you are captive, you have little choice but to pay the exorbitant prices,When we went to pool, there were no chairs available. The pool does not have enough chairs based on the number of rooms. We had to leave the hotel two days early because of a personal issue. We notified the hotel in advance that we were leaving early. We had a timeshare presentation schedule and expected to be called by HGVC to reschedule. Nobody called to reschedule.After we left, we received a very rude email from Robyn Tower of HGVC stating we owed an additional $1,267.05 because we did not attend the scheduled presentation. I tried to contact HGVC by phone thee times and no one answered the phone even though all calls were made during normal business hours. I wrote 5 emails to Robyn and she never wrote me back. I finally did receive a call and said it was their policy to charge and that is what they were going to do. I have contacted AMEX to dispute the charge. In short, we have a very bad impression of Hilton and the Hilton Grand Vacation club. I highly recommend an all-inclusive resort in Cancun over this resort in Hawaii. It will cost you less and you will feel more relaxed. DO NOT USE THE HILTON GRAND VACATION CLUB!!!! ", " Stayed in this property for a week and have to ch anged room during my stay but unfortunately forgot my shoes ( new shoes ! Stewart Weissman ) behind and only after 3 days realized that I do not have them with me and asked lost &found about my item - guess what ... - nothing was found . I asked manger of the hotel if any further action could be taken at least to compensate my problem and only 1 solution was - to start police investigation wich should start from me (?) ... So , the end of the story - I have to go home in flip flops ...on another note - there is no beach in this hotel ...some kind of pond or they call it lagune , hundreds people walking with strollers and screaming kids , food/ drinks are very expensive, very crowded place with long waiting time at the lobby and crazy expensive - so will certainly suggest stay away from it . ", " Booked this as an Expedia vacation package for me and my husband as an 'upgraded' hotel than what we usually get. He had been working hard and really needed to get 'pampered' and go on a proper vacation. This was the Wrong Hotel for that! Zero value... a walking guest/$wallet layout. Even a little 2 star hotel would at least give guests some free water source in the lobby, maybe some fresh coffee (it is Hawaii?)... and how about some sort of breakfast for that kind of price per night? Not even a muffin? For the amount shelled out on valet, resort fees, food, coffee.. etc... Absurd. No bell-hop even? This 'family award resort' makes parents and guests slepp all their own luggage around such a huge property? We felt so bad for families on arrival - exhausted, sitting on the boat with luggage all around them... thirsty... C'mon Hilton? That should be \"Delivered to our rooms via service hallways, waiting, so the kids can ride the boat or monorail\" type of guest-service moment that this place lacks... lacks it everywhere! We didn't see/encounter ANY guest service employees on the grounds beyond the main lobby... only food/janitorial staff. Not one cheery smile - like, walking ghost halls.. Dining options were extremely out of balance for such a big place. I don't even want to continue this review... it isn't worth it. ", " My husband and I traveled from New York to the Big Island during the Valentine\u02bbs Day weekend; I am originally from the Big Island and we were staying with family but had arranged to check-in to the Hilton Waikoloa Resort on Valentine\u02bbs Day. Our check-in was scheduled (as most other hotel check-ins are) at 3:00 p.m. We arrived an hour and a half later than check-in at 4:30 p.m. only to be told that our room was not ready. The front desk attendant was very apologetic and gave us two vouchers for a free entree at a restaurant located closest to the tower that our room would be located in. Upon arriving at the tower we asked if we could leave our suitcases at the desk with a different attendant who was also very pleasant and apologetic about the situation; she gave us two free beverage vouchers for the same restaurant which we promptly decided to visit while we were waiting for our room. At 6:30 p.m. we were informed that our room was ready but was moved to a different tower than the front desk attendant had originally told us. We then lugged our suitcases over to our new tower and made it up to our room. This was my husband\u02bbs first visit to a Hilton hotel and I had, to say the least, \"talked it up,\" reminiscing about all the times I had visited with my family as a child. I spoke of all the fun things there to see including the boat ride, the water slide, Dolphin Quest, the bridge and wrap-around pool. We were told that the pool closed at 5:00 p.m. meaning that by the time we were granted access to our room at 6:30 p.m., it was already closed. We did our best to make light of the situation and walked around the hotel premises but could not help but be upset with how our Valentine\u02bbs Day evening had turned out. In the morning we decided that it would not be unfair or unjust of us to ask for a late check-out so that we could enjoy all that the Hilton Waikoloa had to offer. My husband called the front desk requesting a late check-out; we simply wanted two more hours in our room and instead of checking out at 12:00 p.m., we\u02bbd like to check-out at 2:00 p.m. He received a very rude, \"No\" with zero explanation and upon inquiring was told that he could pay for the extra two hours; he explained how our check-in process went the day before and that we did not have access to our room until three and a half hours after check-in to which the response of the front desk attendant was, \"check-in is any time after 3:00 p.m.\" He asked if she thought this was fair and the right way to treat guests to the hotel to which she replied, \"yes.\" Being completely dumbfounded by what he had just heard from someone who works in \"Hospitality Management,\" he gave a sarcastic, \"thanks\" and hung up the phone. After a moment to think over what had just occurred, we decided to call back and ask for a manager, who did help in providing us a \"hospitality room\" to be able to shower in, however, we do not think that this made the situation right. We had to check-out of our room at 12:00 p.m. and hang around the hotel with our suitcases until 2:00 p.m. when we were able to access the \"hospitality room.\" I have never had to worry about watching my suitcases and being in close proximity to them while I am trying to relax/lounge at the pool; point being, we were never able to relax with all of our things sitting in the middle of the pool deck. I am unbelievably disappointed in the Hilton Waikoloa especially for the amount of money that we paid to stay there for a single night! I am a kama`aina (local) and unfortunately the kama`aina rate was sold out for the night yet we still decided to spend big bucks to stay there because of my past experiences. This horrible experience has trumped all of the great experiences I have ever had at the Hilton and we will never again be customers to the hotel. ", " As a Hilton Honors Diamond member for the last 16 years, I was expecting much more. When we arrived yesterday, the hotel was completely full and we were assigned a room overlooking the parking lot for 9 days (I made reservations 6 months ago). We received an apology and said they would reassign a room in 48 hours. In addition, no Executive Lounge or \"Free Buffet breakfast\". We received eighteen $10 off coupons that could be used at any restaurant. The buffet breakfast costs $32 per person, we are here for 9 days, do the math. We actually stayed here 6 years ago and the experience was much better. The Hiltons in Hawaii are very stingy when it comes to rewarding Diamond members, as it can be \"hit or miss\" based on the Hotel's whim. Other Hiltons around the world and the USA seem to bend over backwards to make our stay a memorable one. I am considering cutting this vacation short and returning home to Seattle ASAP and booking a trip to Cabo. ", " Two major complaints: First my wife slipped down the stairs in their pool area. The stairs were very slippery given that they're located directly beside the pool and always wet. She was badly injured, had to go to hospital and it severely impacted the remainder of our Honeymoon. Despite this incident being reported, at no point did the Hotel check in or ask us if we were okay. When the hotel was out of rental cars and taxis were extremely expensive to reach the hosiptal did the hotel offer any kind of support to assist us in reaching the hospital. Secondly we attended one of the Hilton's timeshare sales presentation, although prior to attending this \"90minute\" presentation was sold to us as something complete different. The sales person was very aggressive and pushy and would not let us leave for almost 3 hours. Ironic given that at the beginning of the presentation they told us their values were \"Not pressuring you and that we understand your time is valuable\". Upon conclusion and realising we were not going to fork out more than $20k the salesman insulted us. ", " I am typing this from my suite at the hotel. There is a large group here called West Central. They have such loud music playing and the hotel manager does nothing at all to control the nuisance. We were out stargazing behind the Ocean tower and were accosted by members of the meeting accusing us of stealing their alcohol. Our room is in the Ocean tower and the loud event is happening at the Palace tower. Our entire room is vibrating and we can not use our balcony due to the noise. We can not go to sleep due to the noise. Please know that this hotel continues to cut services and cater to large groups and that the vacationer is neglected and told just to put up with it. ", " You have to seek out the hotel staff. I think they hide on purpose. None of them looked happy to be there. None of them offered to help.So you arrive and the lobby looks great, it's open. You check in, then you have to wait for a monorail to pick you up. Can be up to 10 minutes. Then it takes you to your building. You get out. Again there are staff there, but their backs are to you and not one of them offering to guide you. You're not sure which direction to go or even where the elevators are because there aren't any signs. The building is so big that you really don't want to walk in the wrong direction. Once we figured it out, we noticed on other days, that new guests had the same experience we did - NO HELP.You get to your room and it's laid out really weird and the room is very dark. The Adult only pool is in the middle of the \"Island Towers\". If you didn't know any better, you would think you sitting at a pool in an apartment complex. No view of the ocean or the lagoon, just concrete.Valet or self park? It's $5.00 difference, just valet it. Don't bother calling ahead to pick up your car though, they don't answer.If you want to go out and about and travel the island, make sure you plan ahead and take everything with you when you leave. If you forget something and need to go back to your room, from dropping your car off at valet, getting to your room and back, it can be a 45 min round trip.We tried to keep an open mind about the place. It's a Hilton, it had to get better, right?We decided to treat ourselves to the Kamuela Provision Company. The menu looked good and great views of the sunset. Yes it's REALLY expensive, but we thought the food would be amazing, along with the service. We dressed up and shouldn't have.Ordered the special for the night. This had to be the WORST meal I've ever eaten. The fish was so dry it was gross. The server had no idea what he was serving. When you're paying $56.00 for an entr\u00e9e, you better know the sauce that goes with it and not \"I don't know some sort of butter sauce\". You're paying 4 Seasons prices and getting iHop service.When we got back to our room - 4 cockroaches. That was it, we were checking out early. DONE. When we called concierge they offered us a different room in the same building. But I had to go back to the front building, get the new room keys and move myself. The correct response should have been, we'll be right there to help you move.Stay at the Marriot right down the road, or just rent a condo. ", " The hotel room we got in the oceanfront tower was very dated. We requested another room but there were none available over the Christmas holidays. At these prices the room was less than we had expected for our family Christmas. Popcorn ceiling and mold surrounding the bath. The resort itself was overly busy and very loud. Not a peaceful place to holiday. The pools are very chlorinated, and the dolphin pool seemed dirty. I guess that's understandable since there are 13 dolphins locked into a small pool together. We spoke to one of the staff about the Dolphins and they didn't seem to care about the conditions. They went on to tell us that the Dolphins are born and raised there. Very sad. Overall we felt disappointed with the resort, staff, and care for the wild life....oh yes, and they keep pink flamingos in a room the size of our dining room at home. We will not be returning to this resort. ", " The resort itself is OK if you like the idea of a fake paradise in a real paradise, and you don't mind not having a natural beach at all - only a very narrow strip of sand at the edge of \"natural pool\" that's literally the width of a lawn chair and predominately accessible only to guests staying in one of the buildings. And if you like captive animals - everywhere. Behind glass, on fake islands, and in the pools. The poor sea turtles in the large family pool. Who is looking out for them while snorkelers chase them? There was no one when we sat at a dining table nearby and watched. But the truly unforgivable aspect for my husband and I were the captive dolphins. Whereas wild dolphins swim for miles and miles each day in large bodies of water, these poor dolphins have just a tiny pool that they have lived in for who knows how many years. And to make it just that much more cruel, these dolphins are undoubtedly aware of the real ocean that's just yards away, on the other side of a rocky beach near their dismal pool. One employee tried to tell us they were diabetic dolphins and had to live there. Right. And even if that were true, they don't deserve to live like that! Shame on this resort, and shame on Hilton for allowing this!!! We turned down joining the Hilton Grand Vacation Club for this reason! ", " So let me start of saying that I am a Diamond Member and have stayed at Hilton's across the Globe and I will have to say that this hotel is not any category but the pits. Motel 6 does better than hers. Why you ask? Because the service level is below standard, and I mean way below for what you are paying. First thing you'll notice is that it's a resort without 24 hour room service. This is a first to me. What the heck??? Resort name needs to change becuase this listing does day room service buy no evening. None of the stores onsite are owned by Hilton so they're close early and service takes minimum of 30 to 45 min for anyone to get to your room or they ignore you. This is just pitiful and this hotel category needs to drop to lower setting. 4 or 5 star hotel mean top service and thus hotel must have paid the locals for it. Service is just awful. An added more is that food prices are 3x more than any hotel in any resort from Cabo to Amsterdam. Just straight \" who cares about you you we have you so screw you\" prices. Recap services are not what they say or promise and prices are just down right legal theft. Stay at the Marriott down the street or another island.I for one will never stay at this hotel again nor recommend it to anyone. ", " it was awful ! We were in the ocean tower, our room was run down, the wall paper was peeling, the phone didn't work properly, you could not see the clock it was so small, there were wires everywhere and after rearranging acouple of them we got the lamp and a couple of outlets to work. There was only 1 chair and no table. and It hadn't been vacuumed in a very long time, there were small ants here and there and a cob web in the bathroom.So after seeing our disappointing room we decided to go to the pool!The pool was shut down for the rest of our stay (it had been over a month) to be fixed at our tower and the adult only pool was smaller then a kiddie pool and not very inviting unless all you want to do is read! more disappointment !so, we packed up our things and took the tram to the other side of the resort to the other pool to find the water falls not working or the jacuzzi, and the water was so cold that it was uncomfortable to be in and the pool was falling apart. But it was better then our closed pool.The food was good at the restaurants that were open except the pizza place (I've had better sauce out of a can!)I swam with the dolphins. That was a wonderful experience and I would do that again.so to sum up my Hilton experience The Dolphins were awesome, the weather was great,and the rest of our visit was disappointing, your hotel was to be the best of the 3 that we stayed at during our visit . Your hotel didn't come close to the Outrigger Waikiki or Westin Maui we stayed at on the other islands.your hotel rating from us is poor. ", " This place is actually very nice and clean. But the main purpose of this Hilton resort is to sell time share. The space is given to many individuals for free or very little cost. So some of the crowd is as such expected. But over all when you ask for anything out side the standard package the answer is a very clear cut no. The staff as such is very un helpful. This is irrespective of whether you are a visitor an owner or anything else. Here is an example. Our flight was at 10 pm check out is 10 am. We reserved a room for our check out date listed at $599.00 a night. They refused to allow us to check in before 3 pm. So does anyone think it takes them 5 hours to clean these rooms? And if you are not checked out by 1015 they are already calling the room!! I understand it is Christmas but really? They actually responded back to me that no early check in because we are sold out!!! How does that change the time rooms become available. So expensive and not helpful. Far from any civilization including what is on the property you must have a car. Their shuttle service is not reliable.  ", " For many years the Hilton has offered a membership which allowed locals to use the spa, the tennis courts, the fitness facility and the pools. Hawaiian ID was required to be eligible for this deal, so it ONLY applied to people who lived on the big island. Without notice and quite arbitrarily the Hilton changed the memberships so that locals can no longer use the pools, or the change rooms and showers at the spa. The new program provides inferior service at a higher price. There isn't even a local rate and the seniors membership has been eliminated. When I spoke to the spa manager she said that the time share members were using the pool so there wasn't room for the spa members and there was a liability issue. Both those statements were disingenuous.mif there are 10 members a day at the resort I would be stunned and as spa members we have all signed liability waivers. The Hilton just doesn't want locals. The members have supported the hotel when the economy was in the tank and it is unconscionable for them to treat loyal supporters this way. We will no longer r commend the hotel to our friends from the mainland and we will not r commend the facility to friends planning weddings or reunions. ", " Our room was disgustingly dirty when we arrived - a dried pool of urine on the toilet, stained carpet and dirty tiles floors in the bathroom. The place looked like it was trying to \"mask\" the outdated and poorly maintained walls and such - looks like it needs a complete face lift. The $25 a day SELF parking was a rip off - the gate hardly works and you have to call and wait to get someone to open it for you. The restaurants are WAY overpriced (even for Hawaii prices!) and the service mediocre. Definitely NOT a 4 star resort - stay clear away if you don't want to feel ripped off like we did! ", " I am a Hilton Honors Diamond. Being treated as poor as we have at this property is unacceptable. This stay was the low point of our honeymoon in Hawaii.Room was terrible with air conditioning not working nor the type of bedding we requested. We can't accept a basement room lacking of privacy.Giant property makes no one cares or prepared our Honeymoon arrival. The price of all amenities is truly unacceptable keeping people hostage of the place. Be aware, this location has no natural beach. It takes over half an hour just to get to the front desk from far away rooms.We can't wait to come back to Hawaii big Island, but will stay away from this place! ", " We had never been to the big island so we were stunned by the width and breadth of lava on the Kona landscape, Spartan and ugly compared to the Hawaii I had experienced so many times before. I had to remember that this is the DRY side of the island, so vegetation is sparse. From the airport to the hotel is a wasteland. Nothing to see or miss. Then the resorts appear out of nowhere. Nicely appointed shopping district, near the Mariott and the Hilton. Cab fare is $60 minimum to get to the hotel. Uber is restricted from pickups at the airport, but a return trip using Uber may save a few bucks.This is not a budget friendly island. Transportation, food, entertainment and even bottled water costs a fortune.Pools are nice, with ample area to get some sun. Shade is at a Premium. They should have considered this in the design phase.Service is first rate with all employees very engaged and friendly.Golf is the only thing that I thought was fairly priced. I played the \"Beach\" course but only 2 holes fronted the water. The fairways were nice but the greens were terrible with large burnt out areas and very dry conditions. They had trams and boats to shuttle between buildings but they were few and far between and wait times were far too long. They seemed to run the tram and boat at the same time instead of alternating departures. Kind of irritating. The rooms were decent sized (ocean tower) but a bit dated and worn. One sink? Really? I hated he battleship gray walks of the inner corridor, and the lack of elevators that made it a long walk everywhere. Beds were firm to hard an I woke up with a backache every morning.No beach! It's a volcano so there is no sand! Pools had nice waterfalls and slides however. Had a good time but I would not do it again, at least not on this side of the island. ", " This sprawling resort on first impression seemed decent, but once you start peeling back the layers, you realize it is woefully inadequate and not well run.It is certainly \"dated\" as others have mentioned. Our room was about as underwhelming as I could have imagined for the prices charged. There is no beach. The food was of the quality you would expect at a business travelers economy hotel. The tram is run as inefficiently as could expect which makes getting around the grounds on foot a necessity. I actually enjoyed the walks because of the sound of the surf and the warm weather but you could see they don't take care of the grounds as they must have at some point in the past. The boat moat was full of algae and often smelled.Prices for coffee and small items were very high and not of a high quality.As I walked to our room, when we got to the hotel, my comment to my wife was \"this place is a dump compared to it's competitors\". It's obvious they've given up trying to make it a destination point for vacationers. There are much better options on the Island and I would never go back. ", " I had a conference on Oahu for a week then traveled to the Big Island for a week of vacation with my husband, sister and brother-in-law. We had stayed in the Ali'i Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu and were pleased with the accommodations and amenities there so were looking forward to a similar positive experience at the Hilton Waikoloa Village but no such luck.The resort does have a beautiful setting and is surrounded by ocean vistas but our collective impression is that it is old, dated and overpriced. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and had nice views but our rooms were very unattractive and not at all what we expected. Both of our rooms featured ugly grayish-brown carpeting, grasscloth wall covering that was peeling in many places, small, cramped bathrooms and mismatched, scratched furniture pieces. We were also unhappy with the handful of food outlets that were available on property. The resort is huge with many guests so there were long waits for dinner and only one place that offers a very expensive breakfast. Since the Hilton and the neighboring Marriott are relatively remote, you're stuck with either eating at your resort or paying to take a shuttle to the nearby Queen's Marketplace Center where there are a few additional choices but nothing outstanding. The operating hours for some of the restaurants were inconvenient and annoying as well. We had a decent late lunch at the Lagoon Grill one afternoon but they close at 5:00 so it's not an option for dinner. On another night, my husband and I wanted to get a late drink after dinner but the Cantina in our tower was closing at 9:00 so we hiked all the way back to the Malolo Lounge in the main lobby only to find that a loud and obnoxiously drunk wedding party had taken over the place.But our biggest complaint by far was the slow and inefficient tram system that operates at the Hilton. The resort is very spread out and can be confusing to navigate so if you're unwilling or unable to walk long distances, your only option is to take the tram which can be maddening. Our room was literally a 20-30 minute walk to the main lobby and even farther away from the Lagoon Tower so by the time we hiked there in the heat and humidity, we needed another shower. There are also small boats that carry guests but for some reason, they don't start operating until 2:00 p.m. A friend of mine was staying at the Marriott down the road during the same time frame and texted several times how much she loved it so I really wish that we had not picked the Hilton. So, learn from our mistakes. ", " Have stayed at many Hiltons and will not stay at this one again it was my first stay and my last stay. Pool was Beautiful though! Stay away from the cantina foo not so good, October is kinda buggy, our room was wrong only had one bed supposed to have 2 I was lucky enough not to sleep on the floor. lots of noisy birds and lots of cats yes cats IDK ", " We received an e-mail for a 72 hour special all inclusive deal back in April. Sounded like a great deal. Supposed to be room breakfast and 3 course dinner for each person. Having stayed at many all inclusive resorts including the Hilton All Inclusive in Costa Rica it sounded great. We booked for Sept 5-10. The all inclusive wound up automatically putting a 10% room charge for every food item and every beverage. Our breakfast every morning for 2 people was over $80. No 2 people can eat that much breakfast. Granted we only had to pay $8.99 gratuity but that is not the point. We would get 1 appetizer 1 entree no desserts and a couple of drinks and our tip would be $15.00 now this was for both of us we did not each get 1 appetizer 1 entree and drinks it we had our bill would have been much more. The point is this was not my understanding of the all inclusive. The place is way too big the tram system highly inefficient Never showed up when it was supposed to could walk 1 mile faster. Although the staff expecially the housekeeping was very nice friendly and did their job well. Very disappointed in this experience and maybe I should have researched more before I fell for the 72 hour deal. ", " The resort is large and not kept up alt all. Boat water is dirty. Too crowded. Overbooked. Staff is rude. Hotel is dirty. Pool water cloudy, area dirty, had to wait for pool towels. No parking for guests. Food fair but pricey. Rooms dirty and not stocked. Very noisy room. We requested a high room, did not get. We requested a quiet room. We were put by the elevator. Disturbed sleep. ", " This is the type of hotel of nightmares. First, it has nearly 1,200 hotel rooms...this is huge!!! As a result it is very crowded, everywhere, and noisy. The lobby, for registration and check-out, will take 30-40 minutes, so plan for this. Also, it will take 30-40 minutes for the hotel to deliver your luggage. Another consideration. The property is soooo large that they provide an internal traveling system, of a tram or boat. Each run every 15 minutes, and large crowds gather at each pickup/dropoff spot. It is like travelling a crowded city subway, with people piling on, some with luggage, others wet from the pool, some with strollers. Is this what you want, on a Hawaiian holiday? Their hotel louge has tasty appetizers ad good service, but absolutely old and horrible live entertainment, unless you like music like Rhinestone Cowboy. Outdated, crowded, pricey, waste. After one night, we left, to find a much better alternative. Save yourself, and your money, and make your reservations at Mauna Lani Bay, the next hotel down-the-road....you will find much Aloha, a stark contrast to Hilton Waikoloa. ", " My family and I booked a long stay at this hotel hoping it would be as much fun as our previous vacation 3 years earlier to Kauai. But this is not the same kind of place.We took advantage of a cyber-Monday deal the Hilton offered and upgrade to the MAKAI rooms in the Lagoon Tower. We were told we could upgrade our package to include breakfast for each room upon arrival. Upon check in we were told we would have to talk to the concierge in the morning about the upgrade. We went down to the desk first thing in the morning only to be told that an upgrade was impossible. Later in my stay the assistant manager told me this was untrue. not sure if the staff is poorly trained or if this just a cover story. Arriving at the hotel I was looking forward to a warm greeting which never really came. The first words for the hotel valet was \"what do you want\". Not Aloha or good evening or some other welcoming greeting. This should be a red flag for anyone considering this hotel, you get this kind of greeting from most of the staff and we experienced this for 13 days. The MAKAI package is supposed to include a personal escort to your room and express luggage handling, none of which we received. If fact we had to ask for help with our bags to our rooms. Not very welcoming for us after traveling 15 hours to get there.Getting to our rooms (we booked 2 rooms for 7 people) we notice trash left on the lanai and reported this several times. It took them 3 days for them to remove it. I am not sure how this in anyway would help this hotels reputation achieve a 4 star rating but this point alone should make it drop quickly. Service should be a key factor in a 4 star hotel and this hotel has very little if any customer service.Entering the room it was easy to notice the air conditioner was not working correctly, the temperature was a balmy 75 degrees and not at all comfortable. we quickly tried to turn it as low as it would allow (65 degrees) thinking it would cool the room quickly. The room never went below 69 degrees. The next morning we went down to the front desk to complain about the temperature only to be told that we needed to adjust to the climate. They did however put in a maintenance request to have it fixed. Maintenance came down and adjusted the thermostat to 60 degrees but that was just for show. Our rooms never got below 69 degrees for our entire stay. We were told by the front desk that the newly updated rooms in the Lagoon Tower had air conditioning units that were not adequate for the space. We went down a second time to complain about the air conditioning to the manager. He informed us he would get the issue fixed. We were told that if they had to put a new unit in they would. Still the room remained at 69 degrees and nothing was done. We requested that they provide us with fans to help circulate the air in the rooms. The manager commented that they didn't normally do that but in our case they would. During our stay we had numerous other problems such as our room keys failing to work properly (replaced many times), Parking key card had to be requested by us and replaced due to malfunctioning key several times.Finally the last straw was the cockroaches in the room. On our 7th night the kids found a cockroach in the room. We complained to management and were told that cockroaches were a common thing in tropical climates. They also suggested we not keep our lanai door open. We informed them we had not had it open due to the fact we were trying to keep our room temperature down. Management sent house keeping in to do a thorough cleaning and someone in to spray. This did not keep us from feeling safe from bug infestation.This is completely unacceptable in a 4 star hotel. ", " We specifically picked this place as it as out of the way and for its laid back presence. We were fully aware that this seclusion was going to come with a price premium for everything and had accepted that. We also liked that it seemed to offer family friendly facilities.The facilities are quite good but that is the end of the positives. Yes you pay a price premium but wow, how much. Everything from food, drink, activities and tours made the $30 for 30 minutes with a paddle board seem reasonable.All this premium must be compensated with service right...wrong. The service was at times not available and then when it was the help was inaccurate or required to ask several different people the same question to determine the answer. The entire resort seems to be run by numerous different businesses (perhaps sub leasing) operating independently and seemed to be inconvenienced by your intrusion, especially when asking to charge the amount back to your roomAnd the biggest disappointment...the food. Prices and sizes aside, sheer quality was abysmal. The only decent meals we had were offsite, mostly 35 minutes away in Kona, and half the price (ok, I couldn't keep price out of it). We ate at every restaurant with the exception of KPC, their \"signature\" restaurant, only because we were so disappointed everywhere, setting the benchmark so low, that we couldn't see fit to spending $60 on a main.So if you are looking with a family vacation location with great pools and access to the beach, there are literally thousands of better options! ", " Three very bad experiences with Hilton brand hotels and they are now off my hotel list. The first was a franchise hotel in Myrtle Beach. We were told that the hotel was loosing their franchise due to poor quality, yet Hilton made no effort to make it right. They did later offer us a great deal on the Hilton Village hotel on Hawaii explaining that this was a corporate hotel, not a franchise. We took the bait. Meanwhile, we were given a free hotel night in Mystic CT. This hotel was under renovations. It was noisy, the roof leaked (6 inches of water on the first floor) and had to disable the fire alarm to prevent it from continually going off. The Hilton Village was the last straw. They messed up the reservations, the rooms stank, the waterways stank, they kept trying to move us, and as friendly and concerned as the staff was, the best they could do was offer us a $100 credit and free ice cream. Hilton, This does not make it right! ", " 8/8/2015 We stayed here three nights after spending 6days in Hilo and Kona area and let me tell you the worst experience we had over the vacation in Hilton. Rooms dirty, old rugs, smelly in room and on a hall way. Also front desk lady was very rude when we ask them to change the room. On our third day in early morning there were workers fixing upstairs room by making huge noise of drilling and banging. Very shocking experiences that I never expect on our vacation that they were remodeling the room upstairs. Called the manager and told us that they cannot stop them working until 5pm!!!!!!!!!! Wowwwww! What a place to end in Hawaii. More over, in Hilton, there is no real beach to play with kids just fake noisy and dirty water for the kids to play. lagoon is just a name that make fancy but reality no fun at all. They need to change all the things to improve to get 5 star next time very soon! ", " We're Here now. I spent time here years ago. The place has REALLY gone downhill. I so badly want to like it but every moment here has brought more disappointment and anger. This place does not have Hilton standards, unless something has dramatically changed w Hilton. Had to change rooms 3x. The ocean tower is disgusting. 1st room was covered in moldy walls w a damp bedspread. 2nd room black hairs in the sink, tub & all over the floors. 3rd room we asked to chAnge to the Palace tower, more acceptable. Bell desk took minimum of an hour to come help us move. We finally arrived in the room by 10pm. Wasted the 1st day. Staff is completely rude & don't even try to make your vacation special. The pools are dated. We were completely ignored by serving staff at the pool. The boat cantina served THE most disgusting food yet, 70.00 later...Who uses fried rice in a taco salad? Shrimp tacos were awful, watery & fishy. It's strait up offensive. Dona & Toni's pizza was ok, the star of the show so far. The breakfast servers are awful as is the breakfast. I have spent years in the hospitality industry and the problems here are glaring & yet there is so much opportunity to make this a great place. The spa is $$ but had a nice massage w Natalie who customized services to fit my needs. The pool deli market food is AS bad as a gas station. It's unbelievable & shocking! We so badly wanted to spend money and enjoy lunch there but 17. For a panini that was clearly made 3 days ago or nachos or a hot dog? Really? It's insane. The front desk has been pleasant but the manager was not helpful. He gave us a free breakfast buffet for the room issue but it was hardly enough to measure up to hit after hit since we've arrived. The valet parking is a nightmare and somehow they feel comfortable charging 25. A day. We are giving today another go of it since we're already here. It's been discouraging and upsetting overall. We wouldn't mind paying the prices of we didn't feel so disgusted at the majority of the encounters & experiences. I sadly would not recommend this place anymore. It's just not the same. ", " This hotel is rather old and poorly maintained. There is trash and cigaret butts on the ground and in the hallway. The bugs from the dirty canal river can bite people and cause severe discomfort. Communication with the hotel was poor and upset. Now everyone has a choice when traveling, and you can choose the nearby Marriott beach hotel instead which is a much nicer property and much better value for your money. PS: if you have bites from the bugs the hotel would try to offer you a plate of fruits for compensation (and that was rather comforting)! ", " This place has taken such a dive in my book was here a year ago and it was great now less employees and the place is a mess .. hey Hilton what happen ? The place is going down hill . All the food places close at 9pm the coffee places close at 5pm ! This is a resort people stay on the property and really don't want to run down to Kings or Queens shopping center . Do something or I will have to book somewhere else next year ", " Just arrived, and what I recall of this place 20 years ago as a Hyatt it was nice, albeit disgustingly huge like a Disneyland with mobs of fat tourists wearing beach ball outfits. Now it is simply disgusting. Room stiiiiiiiinks! Furniture is so smelly I refuse to sit on it. The inside pond where entry doors are is overgrown with algae (stinky). Paint is monotone, there are VERY few elevators, requiring you to hall luggage up 5 flights. Staff is friendly but probably burnt out, views are nice. Place is HUGE so if you like amusement parks that reflect nothing of Hawaiian culture this is for you. ", " If you want to be nickel and dined and subject to constant sales pressure, then this is the place for you! We waited 2 1/2 hours to get into the second of our two rooms on our day of arrival. There was a problem with the lock. The staff was actually confrontational to us about this problem. They tried numerous times to have us attend a grand vacations sales presentation. Only to find out once we spent about 30 minutes in the sales office that we could not qualify. We were bounced out like we had trespassed on the property. This place is so big and the staff very uncaring. The final straw was our room service order was not picked up for 8 hours. When our 9 year old opened the door in the morning after all of the food was out overnight, birds were devouring the leftovers and insects were abound. We complained and they said that they don't pick up food after 10pm. No apologies or acknowledgment that this was not a good practice. We ended our stay there promptly and moved to another resort on the island. We will not be staying at a Hilton ever again! ", " We've been going to the hilton for appx 8 yrs. This year was our last. The resort was dirty. And the service was very bad. We had several disappointments. We took all of our children and grandchildren for our 40th wedding anniversary, the monies spent were not worth it by far. Spa showers were dirty. Several of our rooms had to have repairs. We spoke to a \"manager\" but nothing was done! Again we will not return!!!! ", " First off, this place is massive, if you are in the Ocean Tower it will take you at least 15 minutes to get to your room from the lobby. It was also dirty, one towel had a big fresh yellow spot and another caked mud. One day the room wasn't cleaned at all. Room service hours were not 24 hours like the menu in the room said. Employees were generally unfriendly although a couple were nice. ", " This was more of a 1980's theme park than hotel. The Ocean Tower should be renamed the Bird Tower, don't expect to sleep until 4am. No frills, definitely not a Hilton level accommodation. The property has no beach access. You can see the ocean and it has a great place to watch the sunset but no bar and no drink service after 4PM. ", " i have been a hilton honor gold member for 3 years. i always stay at a hilton brand. paid 577.00 for 1 night. old coaches with blood stains. old old furniture, worst the hotel lost personal items through either bell desk or cleaning crew. ", " This was my worst Hilton experience ever. Rooms need redone, super expensive food and poor quality, my room overlooked multiple housekeeping rooms. Lagoons seem dirty, they are short staffed, overheard staff talking about how they had to close restaurants because of no staffing. Even phone service was poor when you needed to reach the front desk it took forever took get thru. Staff is also just not knowledgeable about the resort and services etc when you ask. I would not come back here or recommend. ", " Stayed here on 7/14/15, 1st of all I booked the 2 rooms 3 months ago and had requested them to be connecting rooms. I have 2 daughters that are 15 and 10 yrs old so when I checked in they told me that they could not accommodate connecting rooms. I also spoke with the general manager and they did not help the situation. I booked for the makai lagoon tower and they said it was sold out. So then I checked out the next day and they told me it was $100 for each room for an early departure fee.. my daughter had left her allergy cream (which was a perscription) and they said they threw away the lotion so I called 7 times and finally got they gave the cream back..I would never stay at this property again go to the mariott next door staff is more friendly and accommodating. Left several messages for the manager and they have not yet responded. .. ", " I will start by saying I'm a hotel snob. In my defense, the Hilton brand has had a lot to do with my snobbishness. The first time we visited the Hilton Waikoloa in 2004, it seemed to have been recently renovated. My then 7 year old son took one look at the lobby and said, \"We must be rich.\" We came back in 2006, and the shine was wearing off a bit. Now, 9 years later everything is exactly the same -- this place is in desperate need of a reno. The rooms are in bad shape - there was a leak from the room above us and so the wallpaper was pulling away from the wall and the carpet was soaked. The beds are tiny and quite uncomfortable - my husband and I are both heading to the chiropractor when we get home! Everything is very spread out and being 10 years old than my last visit, it's a pain to get to a pool or the lagoon! And the resort transportation - boat or tram - seem to run with less frequency, so you're hoofing it back to the lobby. And the fact that they charge $25 to park is a scam - you have to have a car to do or eat anything reasonably priced and moderately edible. I think I'll go back to my luxury all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean with gourmet food, drinks and 2x a day maid service. ", " If you are looking for a tranquil vacation with peace and quiet don't look here. This place is congested, crowded and noisy. It must be a great place for large groups or family reunions because the hotel grounds are packed with parents toting beach gear. The tram and boat system is a joke as we walked faster than both to get to the main lobby. The restaurants are over priced. $5.75 for a small muffin! Lots of hidden costs especially the parking fees. Although the room we had in the ocean tower was spacious, it was in need of a makeover. The carpets had a musty smell . There was a paper clip on the carpet during our entire stay that never got vacuumed. I was appalled that the resort had no recycling bins for all the recyclables that are used and thrown out. With the amount of people at this place, the waste and trash that should be recycled is massive. Thankfully we spent the majority of our stay off the Disney like grounds and found more tranquil spots on the island to enjoy. I'm sure this \"resort\" works for families whose kids love to slide in the pools but I don't recommend this for anyone who wants a relaxing vacation. ", " My husband and I stayed at the in the Ocean Tower for 5 nights in June. This hotel was not the kind of place we'd asked for when booking this through a travel agent, but I blame myself for not researching the resort myself. First of all it is HUGE (as in 62 acres), so if you want to leave the resort a lot and see the island, this is not the hotel/resort for you. You are pretty much locked into the resort if you don't want to get in your car and drive, quite a ways, for a restaurant or anything else. We pretty much ate at every location at the resort and we had the same thought...expensive and the food was just okay. Another disappointment was no actual beach (you know with sand and swimming?) to enjoy; we did enjoy the views and sunsets from our lanai though. There were a lot of Hawaiian artifacts at the resort but the grounds were overloaded with every kind of Buddhist influence; we would have enjoyed more Hawaiian art & history. My husband and I both enjoy walking but we weren't expecting to have to walk for 25 minutes from our room to the valet parking with luggage. You see, we had an early flight to catch so we had to leave at 5:15am and the tram doesn't start until 6am. For us, a smaller and less pretentious hotel with a beach and local restaurants in the area would have suited us better. Fortunately, we went to Kauai next and had all the things we wished we'd had while at the Hilton. ", " Its clean, has air conditioning, Wifi and lovely sunsets...... but the place has a terrible prison vibe. First of all for there is no breakfast (I am pretty sure even breakfast is inc. in prison) and the on-site restaurants charge a large amounts of money for the pleasure. There is very little interaction with anything local, there are a few evening classes that are more stereotypical then anything else and of course these cost extra. Car parking $25 a day and if you are staying in Ocean towers then it takes 20mins to walk to your car. This can be annoying if you forget something, but hey why would you want to leave the resort anyway? If this didn't already give you the prison vibe then wonder over to the dolphin pool and have a look at these animals restricted to a very small pool. Bad review aside its never nice to see animals confined in this way.So if you are want to blow tons of cash and not see any of the beautiful island then this is the place to be. Plus there are designated selfie spots.........gerrr I want to feed who ever came up with this to the dolphins. ", " I wish I could say my stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village was amazing.Yet, this resort ruined the rest of our 1 year Anniversary trip.I paid for a standby upgrade to get into the Makai Ocean View room on the 6th floor of the Lagoon Tower.Oh, what a mistake I made. I thought the Makai experience was supposed to be this grand and wonderful experience. It was neither grand or wonderful. - There was no Makai welcome. No one was at the Makai desk. No lei's were given out to welcome us.- Our room had paper thin walls. We could hear kids crying and adults talking all night long. It almost seemed like they were in the same room as us. We could also hear carts and luggage roll past our door all night long. I could hardly sleep any night we were there.The day we were to leave, we were awakened at 8 AM by the window cleaner who practically barged into our room wanting to clean our windows. Then the room cleaner came in. Do they not realize we were leaving that day and we have not checked out yet? That was our wake up call for the big flight home that day. Not a great experience at all.- The rooms were not gorgeous by any means. They looked like they were barely clean and the shower squeaked loudly upon opening/closing. You could even see mineral deposits on the metal brackets, as if it had hardly been cleaned.- The A/C barely worked, and we turned it down to 66 degrees, just to see if it would get there. It did not - we were cooking in the room it seemed.- The food was expensive and had no flavor. (Example: Imari's bowl of fried rice with Chicken is $18 - I didn't even look at the menu when they asked me if I wanted some fried rice, thinking it was going to be less than $10. Their food is extremely expensive, which is probably why the main dining room was nearly empty)- Dona's Italian restaurant is not only expensive, but the Spaghetti sauce is so bland it tastes like it came directly from a can. A bowl of Spaghetti is $18 for those wondering. A can of Spaghetti O's might have had more taste. When we complained about the sauce, we were given a small discount. Then, the server actually called us that night and took the tip off our bill because he felt so bad about it. I wish he would have kept the tip, as it is the hotels issue and not someone who makes minimum wage.The Japanese steakhouse has an average dish price of over $50, and our hibachi grill master only did one trick - Our $100 meal was worth half that price.- We even took the timeshare presentation to get $200 in order to offset some of the food costs. They claim it is not high pressure, but the way they conduct the presentation is by asking you questions about your life and what you want to do. Then they bring in the salesperson - I saw two Hilton salespeople ridiculing a person when I went around a corner after the person had already left. That left a bad taste in my mouth about what Hilton salespeople are really thinking about their customers that are paying big money to stay at the resort already? - Upon leaving I mentioned the issues to the hotel staff without any offer of compensation - they ignored my issues. In Summary: This is not the place for a tranquil and peaceful experience. Kids were everywhere, even on the 6th floor of the Makai floor, which goes for the highest price, aside from the suites.We had a bad experience overall, and this was my first stay at a HIlton. I am not sure I want to go back a Hilton again. ", " Honestly, this is the worst hotel I have never stayed at, and I cannot stress that enough. I ran the Kona marathon, and I booked the hotel because it was the host hotel and the pictures on the internet made it look amazing. I do admit the ocean view is beautiful even though you cannot swim in the water, and they do everything to distract from its beauty( a lot of fake waterfalls that look good in pictures but not in person and a lagoon that has a very bad odor). The pool and hot tubs were not relaxing and were cheaply constructed(the hot tubs especially were not relaxing and one had a water fall that had water unpleasantly hitting your face) There were also a pool with tortured looking dolphins in a very small area; I honestly felt bad for them. On one review I read they said you can snorkel in the lagoon that is a lie(murky water). Another review I read said it was like Disneyland. I love Disneyland and that is a insult on an epic scale(clearly employees wrote the review). It had a horrible tram that was uncomfortable, extremely slow, inconvenient, and had screaming kids every time I rode it( I like kids but this hotel must make kids extremely unhappy because every restaurant you eat in had screaming kids in it). Disneyland has happy kids and a fun tram. It also had the worst service more than one employee was rude and belligerent. And most of them were clueless and could not answer simple questions and often looked annoyed and bothered by them.(There were a couple nice employees but definitely not the norm). It is a non smoking hotel but this is not enforced. Employees and guests routinely smoked outside 10 to 15 feet from our balcony. The food in the restaurant was also not just bad but extremely expensive. The walls were paper thin, and I had a hard time sleeping because of all the noise in the hall. I felt like a hostage in this hotel, I could not cancel, and it was terrible. This hotel disgraces the name of Hilton and I wish someone would have warned me about how deceptive this hotel truly is. I ended up spending my final night at the Kona Sheraton. That was an amazing experience. If you want a good experience book there. This Hilton is super crowded, very loud, not relaxing, and just terrible. I wish I could give it a lower rating. Just terrible. ", " We are Hilton Diamond members, and we stay at Hiltons frequently. We decided to spend our entire honeymoon at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I'm going to preface this review by saying we're not high maintenance or difficult people-- we're normal folks who were simply expecting to have a fun, relaxing honeymoon at a reliably nice resort.Long story short: We had such a terrible time at this hotel that we checked out on the flyy after a couple days and went to an entirely different island and--more importantly-- an entirely different hotel.Long story: THE ROOM: We booked a room in the Makai section, which is touted as \"exclusive\" and \"VIP,\" and seemed like a nice treat for our honeymoon. If you've ever stayed in a hotel before in your life, you'd know immediately that Makai is none of those things. They give you little bracelets to wear around the resort that are supposed to give you some perks, but only ONE hotel employee recognized it, the rest gave us blank stares. And the bracelets dyed our wrists to boot. It was a completely average hotel room, which makes me shudder to think what the actual standard rooms are like here. The walls are paper thin, so we were treated to the small tribe of children next door screaming and crying at all hours. We could also hear everything going on outside, so every cart that rolled by, every casual conversation that was had, all came through loud and clear into our room. It did, to its credit, have a lovely view.THE RESORT: It's true that the resort is on the larger side and has a tram and boats within it. Neither were necessary or useful to us (or pleasant- the fumes those boats put out are insane), but I think for families with kids or for anyone that might have a harder time getting around they'd be nice. There is a saltwater lagoon that seems like it'd be fun, but was mostly very murky and grossed us out. The pools were plentiful but not very inspiring, and they also had a massive gross out factor. The first day we were there there was poop in the main pool. There was a staff member standing near it, but doing nothing. There were small kids playing nearby and adults swimming in the area and the employee wasn't trying to move them away or clear the area at all. It was truly disgusting. The next day another couple told us a similar story, but with a kid throwing up in the pool. We stopped going in the pools entirely after that. As others have noted, you can't just pick up towels, you have to bring your towel cards and check towels in and out, kind of like you're a towel criminal and you cannot be trusted. If only you got early check out for good behavior.... They also have a few shops near the lobby where people stand in the entryways and try and sell you stuff as you walk by, like kiosks at malls where people shout at you to get you to stop and get your hair curled for no good reason. It's uncomfortable in malls, and really uncomfortable in your hotel while you're trying to relax on vacation. THE FOOD: Bad. Just bad. We tried a few of their restaurants before giving up. Across the board, food was completely bland, like cafeteria food masquerading as a $20 burger, or a small $25 pizza, or...well you get it. The coffee at their coffee shops was good, but that's probably because it is Kona coffee (delicious!) which has nothing to do with the hotel.THE STAFF: To use no sugar coating whatsoever, 85% of hotel employees that we encountered acted like sullen teenagers (regardless of their actual age). They were unhelpful, unknowledgeable, and unpleasant. Several of them wouldn't make eye contact to the point where I wondered if something was wrong with us. One lifeguard was killing lizards in front of groups of small children-- it was totally unbelievable and looking back it's still beyond baffling that that sort of behavior was going on unchecked. We also had a problem with people in the room below us smoking on their balcony basically nonstop. I realize there's no way to say this without sounding lame, but I'm really sensitive to smoke, so this prevented me from going out on our balcony and enjoying our view. Because the hotel explicitly said smoking on balconies was not allowed, we complained about this. Each time, they said that unless they caught these people in the act they couldn't do anything, but because they were chain smoking all that means to me is that no hotel employee ever checked. And each time we called they acted like the issue was new, so I guess they weren't documenting it either.After a few days of this mess (literal and figurative), we decided we couldn't waste another vacation day there. We booked a flight to Kauai and checked into the Grand Hyatt, which was nothing short of spectacular. It only served to highlight how truly terrible the Hilton Waikoloa was. And is.The Big Island is really, well, BIG. Your days are going to be spent either adventuring across the island for almost a full day, or hanging out at your resort for a down day. That means your resort needs to make you happy and be a restful, wonderful place to spend your hard earned vacation days. The Hilton Waikoloa was not that place for us. In fact, it was the antithesis of that place.Everyone has been asking us how our honeymoon was, and we've been totally open in sharing how awful this hotel was, so I wanted to post this review to warn my fellow Yelpers away from this place as well. Do NOT give your time or your money to this place. ", " Pretty much sucked. Had an upgraded package to the \"Lagoon tower\" with a great view of the PARKING LOT. The AC had to run all the time to get the room down to 75 and I would not trust the fridge to keep food cool overnight. Most of the resort was quarantined off for Nickelodeon's new show \"Paradise Escape\". Don't expect to get into the ocean waters with out having to traverse rocks and if you're in the \"Lagoon Tower\" you have to hike the the other side of the property for snacks and what not for your room. All of the food from the restaurants tastes like it either sat under a heat lamp or came out of a microwave. I had to send my silverware back 3 times due to somebody else's food stuck to it. Also don't order anything outside of the drink menu because the bar tenders won't know how to make it. Even the drinks on their menu don't have any consistency. I'M NOT GOING BACK! ", " If you are looking for Peaceful, nature & Hawaii excitement vacation please do not book this hotel. This worst hilton property I ever seen. Hotel has no area where you can seat enjoy.

Please be careful while booking this hotel ", " First of all, we get here, everything's fine. They had a huge Convention of herbal life group and they had music blasting outside of our windows.

This is just a motel 6 super sized ", " The Waikoloa Village on the outside is beautiful. There are lots of swimming pool areas, green and lush landscapes, etc. We stayed at The Palace tower.Positives:BED - Nice and the pillows were very cushy and comfortable.TV - Nice, large flat screen with great picture.CABANAS - Renting the cabanas were a great way to spend the day. The whales were breaching and servers kept the drinks & food flowing. The servers were great and very personable.Negatives:TRAM - Slow... Very slow. You can walk from place to place quicker than waiting on the tram to arrive and waiting at all the stops.A/C - It never seemed to get cool. The A/C must've been on a controlled, governing system. The vanity area was around the corner and was uncomfortably hot.ATMOSPHERE - The room was very dated and a bit dingy. Not at all worth the high price.ELECTRICAL OUTLETS - Very few in the room and not convenient. COFFEE MAKER - Leaked & didn't work half of the time.NO EATERIES IN THE PALACE - We had to go to other towers in order to get anything to eat. Even at that, the prices were exceedingly high!LUAU - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This is by far the biggest waste of money and time. The food was horrible as was the service. It's \"all the drinks you want\"... Good luck on finding a server! $170.00 per person??? Don't do it!!!BELL SERVICE - Never showed up nor did they call. We had to wag our luggage to check out.STAFF - The staff (other than the servers at the cabana area) seemed very disengaged and bothered by us tourists.It was a good thing we had a rental car otherwise, we would have been trapped at this ultra-excessive in price resort all day. I would not recommend staying here. This was our first visit to Hawaii and probably our last to the big Island. It left a bad taste in our mouths. ", " Checking in now, we love the hhv on oahu even with all the craziness. But this hotel sucks. Seriously u get treated better at a best western.

Do not stay here, its lke they are trykng to go out business ", " I know Hilton can do better than this...I stayed in the Palace Hotel and I thought the management forgot this particular hotel existed on their massive property. I didn't see one hotel employee besides housekeeping. The maid service came once a day, no turn down service at night, no newspaper, no mini bar, no water bottle, not even a bedspread.The food was awful and really, really expensive. Very disappointed, Conrad Hilton would turn over in his grave if he knew. ", " Had bug bits in the middle of night and it caused severe swelling and itch of my skin. Called for the assistance for more than 4 times. No real help offered. No explanation nor compensation provided. Only a guy came over and asked me to file a security report that no one at the hotel follows up after two weeks passed. What happened was I had to sleep in the rental car for the 1st night and tried to kill the bugs by myself for the 2nd night. The miserable experience at this hotel plus two scars on my arms from the mosquito bits are the very gifts I brought back from Hawaii. ", " When the first thing you see when you a enter a hotel is a monorail to get you to your room you should beware. We were there for a convention so it wasn't our choice of hotels but.....we would never go back nor recommend it. Here are just a few reasons: Not one umbrella to sit under at the pool, BUT you could rent a 2 seat cabana for $50.00 a day, the only casual restaurant for lunch was more like a bad cafeteria with awful employee service, a cup of coffee+1scone+1 piece of banana bread was over $15.00 at the coffee bar, tables were being torn down and rolled away as we were finishing one of our dinner events while we wer still sitting there. I could go on and on as could many of the other attendees. There a lot of other properties more accommodating on the Island. Don't chose this one!!! ", " I had a great Hawaii trip until I came here. Stay at a local bed and breakfast and save your money, its over priced and nothing stays open late enough to do anything, including bars. This place put me in a terrible mood the moment I showed up. ", " At the end of a pleasant short stay,we forgot several items in our room when we checked out. We called soon after we returned home and although the items weren't valuable we are local and they were worth enough for us to retrieve them. Although we had exact description of the items and where they were in the hotel room, the staff claimed that they had not been found. An email to the general manager finally led to the discovery of one item. It took multiple attempts to deliver it to us just across the island, arriving broken. This broke our trust on many levels. The staff feeling that they could keep the forgotten items. The lack of initial follow thru by the security staff, The fumbling and dropping the ball on returning the one item. It was fun while it lasted. ", " Simply this property is TIRED and filthy. Sure the grounds are nice but once you get in the elevator with the crusted in filth brass elevator buttons, un-swept hallways and barely clean room you realize that the ownership does not care and neither do the staff. I have never stayed at a Hilton property where the staff was so rude, not one pleasant person, NOT one. Skip this place and stay somewhere else. They have one fitness center that could NOT be more difficult to locate and once again when I asked someone where it was they behaved as if I was the biggest inconvenience. Don't be wowed by everything this property says they offer, it's expensive tired and once again filthy. ", " HATED IT!!!!! To large of a property to get anywhere or anything you need. The walking is tedious. 20 minutes walking at least to get to pool, dinning, gift shop, lobby etc. No quick trips to your room to grab something you forgot.

Very disappointed!!!! Won't be visiting here again. ", " Make sure you triple check your reservations. Their reps completely messed up mine. Wrong room, wrong price (they promised cheaper but SWITCHED it when I arrived asking me to pay $100 more for the room promised to me. Uncomfortable beds, the air conditioner was broken and it was HOT! Horrible customer service. Lots of attitude when trying to figure this whole thing out. We were made to sit on the lawn by the pool with all of our bags like homeless people in the hot sun until our room was ready. My son's birthday, the reason we went , was ruined. ", " Absolutely gorgeous scenery on the compound, but that's about it. If you want a comfortable stay, this is NOT it! The interior of our room on the 6th floor of the Palace tower is wretchedly dilapidated. We're talking about curling linoleum, cracked vanity countertop, leaking faucet handle (not spigot, but handle), uneven flow from busted shower head, and mold smells in the restroom. The toilet tank's lid does not even fit the tank, and the seat doesn't even fit the bowl!The sofa in our room looks and feels like it was picked up off the side of the original Route 66 about six decades ago. And, here is a Major Safety Issue: There is no emergency stairwell door or exit signs in sight anywhere near the elevators. Also, the carpet in the entire palace tower looks years beyond end-of-life. And the Ocean Tower is supposed to be WORSE?!?! I pity those patrons. I have stayed in many Hilton properties. I really liked them in FL, CA, and everywhere in between, but to have such a poor showing at a vacation resort?!?! Shame on you Hilton. I hope the building doesn't crumble before checkout...

", " We stayed only one of our two night week had booked. The service from the start was bad at check-in; than when we got to the room man was it old and out dated. Not you\u2019re normal Hilton that is kept up with the time. The rooms on the web site look really nice, but that is not what you get when you get there. Than as a Diamond Member with HH they wanted to charge us $69.00 for an upgrade to a standard old room. All the hot tube are on the one side of the facility and it a long walk to get there. They only run two of the boats and only in the afternoon. The rest sit around the corner broken. I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Stay at the Marriott just down the road. The have service, a nice beach, and great pool and hot tubes. ", " If anyone is considering staying at the Hilton Waikoloa, take a look at the mileage you will put on your shoes, hips and patience. They have a tram for a reason, but it takes so long you choose to walk. Don't leave anything in the room if you are headed to the pool. We stayed in the middle of 3 towers and it still was a 2.7 mile hike. (This mileague was taken from my Nike tracker watch when my husband left something in the car but the keys were in the room.) The grounds are lovely but the food is overpriced and not so great. DO NOT eat at the Itallian restuarant. It was the first time in my life I returned a pasta dish. Like a good cup of coffee in the morning? Not if you have to walk a quarter of a mile. Why not put a cart at the bottom of each hotel wing? AVOID the Hilton Vacations offer like the plague! A 90 minute presentation for $100.00 and a discount card is an insult. Especially avoid this desk if you have had a couple of mai tais. We signed up but returned the next day to cancel and they wanted to charge our credit card $500.00. We showed them our copy of the reciept where the line was blank for returns and they showed us their copy with a hand written $500.00 figure. Not only wrong, but I am pretty sure that's illegal. The brochure says they have a beach but it's not a beach. It's a all big rocks. That was a huge let down for us. We had to get in our car (or they have a shuttle van) and drive around the back of the Marriott to their beach which was on a coral shelf which means every other person exited the water with bloody feet, including me. (Imagine walking to and from my room with the abrasions on my heel- thanks to that, I threw my back out which was a great way to spend the 5 remaining days of our Hawaiian vacation.Lastly, why in the world would you situate a luxurious hotel rght on the coast and plant hedges so you cannot see the water if you are sitting down?? ", " Be careful where what tower you book a room. The hotel has slid so far downhill from the time it became a Hilton property (from Hyatt) 20 years ago. What once was a classy elegant hotel is now a run down Mismanaged Motel 6.The rooms in the Ocean tower are old, dirty and disgusting. The Lagoon tower which overlooks the dolphin pond was remodeled one year ago. The rooms in he the Lagoon tower are the way all Hilton rooms should be as a minimum.Upon our arrival, the lobby was a mess. There were no agents at the regular desk with two at the Honors desk. All customers were jammed packed at the Honors desk. What was the purpose of having a Honors desk? Obviously, no expedited checkin for Honors members.The once elegant looked tacky, old, cluttered, and worn out. The train was soooo slow and we made the long walk to our room in the Ocean tower. The hotel would not upgrade Platinum or Gold to the Lagoon tower. I was offered to pay $189 more a night to upgrade (used 150k points for 3 nights).The train was sooo slow so I made the long walk to the Ocean tower. While opening the door to the room, I noticed it stunk. When I went to open the door to the outside, I noticed little bugs crawling around the door frame. The headboard looked beaten up, toilet had pee under two plastic seals over bolts holding toilet seat in place, door to cabinet with min frig inside was falling off, sheets were filthy (obviously not changed), huge amount of dust behind both phones and sofa. These are all signs the room has not been deep cleaned. Furniture looked dated by 20 years.The phone to the operator rang and rang.. They are clueless on hotel activities and rude by ringing you to another department without telling you they are switching you to another dept or to what dept. They are the most stupid PBX operators. Do they not have a hotel activity sheet to answer guest questions about where an activity is? They were not even aware of the hotels activities for the day.The property was purchased by Blackstone two years ago. The previous owners ran it into the ground. Blackstone financied the purchase. The current management needs to be terminated. I have never seen a hotel so mismanaged.Wireless internet was free for Honors members but did not work in the Ocean tower. ", " This place is okay but the price is outrageous. And they charge you for every single little thing. If I were you I would go find a small bed and breakfast or get a condo. This place had no shame. I would not come here if you are in the ocean tower you have to walk a half mile both ways and there is no beach to swim in on the ocean which to me is false advertising. ", " Nothing is included, the food prices are outrageous, the hotel staff isn't overly friendly or helpful. If you get placed in the far tower it is literally a 1/2 mile walk to the front of the hotel. The Big Island Breakfast is $30/person when you break it out. The most expensive resort ever. Our rooms were clean and the cleaning staff was good. That was about it. Far too overpriced for the experience. I would not recommend. ", " Old, worn, tired looking rooms. This resort is NOT for anyone with a physical impairment. There are NO accessible rooms. It is very difficult to get around the resort with only one slow tram and two slow boats. Prices for food are steep and everything is an extra charge. Service is excruciatingly slow. Wasted a lot of our vacation just trying to get somewhere. People with small children will find it difficult, too. ", " ...you might like the Hilton Waikoloa. It has a bullet train and boats on rails that move around the resort at snail speed so you can enjoy the many statutes and cultures that the Hilton is trying to invoke (my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm very generous with this description ). If you, like us, are looking for a hotel that allows you to get into a relaxed state of mind while giving you some feeling for the Hawaiian spirit, than this hotel is most likely not for you. We arrived here, after a couple of days in Honolulu, to enjoy 5 days of tranquility and island life. The reception hall with its 'train terminal' feeling already suggested what lay in front of us. Overall the resort is big and for anyone who is looking for a theme-park or cut-budget P.F. Chang's atmosphere, this might be right. There are boats (on rails) that transport you at very slow speed through the resort and in general this feels as authentic as any Disney theme park. Statues of not only Hawaiian or Polynesian inspired themes, but rather anything under the sun including Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Dutch...can be found throughout the resort, evoking rather a feeling of mixing and matching in order to present \"culture and history\" than any authenticity at all. Animals are being kept in cages or on small islands (with clipped wings) in order to present visitors with something \"to look at\" while riding the \"bullet train\"/ boats. To us that felt rather sad and I was secretly planning \"the great escape\". Prices at the Hilton Waikoloa are absurd. While we enjoy a good meal and are more than happy to spend $50 plus drinks for dinner per person (btw. we also enjoy In-n-Out Burgers or local genuine pub food), the prices at this place are not in line with the value it provides. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Starbucks regular so I have no problem shedding $3.50 for an drink...a tall hazelnut latte with soy milk at the Hilton Waikoloa...$7.50, a normal cup of coffee at breakfast $6. Now for this amount of money, I expect at least Starbucks taste & quality. Unfortunately our $6 cup tasted the same as complimentary breakfast coffee at any Hampton or Holiday Inn. Anything else is just extra at the resort. For example 1 hr of billiard/ pool: $5 per person please. After 2 days we couldn't take it any longer and escaped to another hotel. Here we found the Hawaii we were looking for...a warm breeze on the hotel terrace overlooking the pool and ocean...enjoying our welcome drinks and soaking in the laid-back island life...heavenly. ", " Avoid this place, apathetic staff, overpriced, and weak resort. The food was awful and crazy expensive and it takes so long to leave you'll wish you listened to me. No shade by the pools which were weak. Random early am phone rings, one breakfast spot which closes at 10:30. Super loud birds every am. I have nothing good to say about this place at all. ", " The welcome moment with the valet team was gruff. No warm welcome from the 'concierge' that checked us in. Room was so moldy and mold smell was covered with some chemical odor from a cleaning solution. A colleague was rousted from bed one evening at 11:15pm to be told by heavy handed security guards that she was not actually checked in to her room and they demanded ID and proof of her right to be in the room...turned out to be a mix up with the front desk. No apology. Head of our association had her lock on the door to her suite fail and had to wait 2.5 hours to enter her room one night. Countless people in our group had key cards demagnetized. Service at banquets was a joke. At final night, our table was never bussed. Ever! Staff handed out 'gifts' from the Hilton Sales Team from dirty milk crates and cardboard boxes. Who runs this zoo? A shameful shameful shameful showing by Hilton here. ", " As my wife and I were leaving the crescent driveway after checking in, a valet was flying up in a SUV, he slowed and stopped next to my car to glare at me as if to threaten me. After I parked the same valet and his buddy gave me the same glare, as they gave a fake Aloha to other guests. Very disturbing and uncomfortable. I never pulled in front of anyone but may have started to come out but that valet was moving so fast that no matter what I would have done it would have slowed his rapid approach. ", " Our room in ocean tower smelled very bad of mildew. Contacted front desk and was offered to see a room in Palace Tower and switch if acceptable. Immediately went to concierge desk to get key card to see room, and was informed that the room in Palace tower had become occupied in last couple minutes- it was 10 a.m.I was told someone would contact me with next available room and it is now 12 hours later no contact. Tried to call front desk and after being on hold giving up. Bugs in room also, I can overlook bugs, they don't seem to bite, but this smell is disgusting! I will check again in morning, my kids are getting ready for bed, too late to do anything now...hopefully will update with better review ", " I have never had worse service than I did here. Every staff member's first response to a question or for assistance was \"no\" It isn't on a beach and they have no shuttle to any beach in the area. There was always something not working or broken. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone ", " Where do I begin? Upon entering our 1 BR Makai suite, we were very disappointed as not only the Room was So outdated (can you say popcorn ceilings) It was dreary beyond belief and the view of the dolphins (well, lets just say you could hear them when they jumped up and splashed, but actually see them was another thing) I immediately went down to request a different room or get an upgrade, where I was told they were sold out and nothing was available. I got on my phone and called the Hilton Diamond Honors line and was told there were rooms available and pulled several of them up on my computer to go back down to the lobby once again to see what the problem was. They suddenly said there was a room available (its a miracle) but I would need to pay the upgraded price, which I agreed to.Our new room was two floors below but the view was directly in front of the dolphins and a much better floor plan and space (of course the up charge was the driving force behind the better room)When the bellman brought up our luggage he shoved it inside the room, did not show us anything in the room or the amenities, lanai, ice, etc. We were in the presidential suite, but did not feel any VIP or Makai experience as they call it.We were tired and hungry after a long day and used the \"Deliver to your room pizza\" After waiting 45 minutes, they called and asked why we hadn't picked up the pizza. He then proceeded to tell us that they only deliver pizza and we had ordered salad and pasta as well. So, needless to say this property is Very large and we had to walk over a mile there and back carrying our take out. The manager was very rude about it and when I got back to my room on the complete other side of the property, he had forgotten the one thing I was looking forward to, the Tiramasu and he forgot to put it in the bag. Really....The shower upstairs (we had two floors) had no hot water, we reported it right away and after two nights of cold showers, I finally got the housekeeper to call engineering while she was in the room to get someone to fix it. It took him sometime as he said it was definitely broke and then our carpet in the bedroom was soaked with water for 2 days as the shower had leaked all throughout the room. We had a couch bed on the bottom floor for my 12 year old to sleep on (also make note there are no closets, dressers or anything on the first floor for any guests) I called housekeeping once again to get the bed made up for my daughter that night and they told me, housekeeping ends at 3;30 and I was told to pull out the couch myself (mind you there was a 10 foot very heavy table in front of the couch that I had to move myself) I then contacted front desk and asked that the bed be put back each day at cleaning and brought out again at night for sleeping, as you couldn't move or have anywhere to sit, if the couch was in sleeping position. Well, this was never done the entire stay. I had guests over two nights and the bed was open and once again no where to sit while entertaining. When I told the manager about this, he asked if the connecting room had no bed for her that was made up, I said obviously you don't even know your property or your rooms, it is not a connecting room, it is the bottom floor of the suite.We rented a car for the day from the hotel and when I went to go to the nearby mall the next day, the valet guy was on the phone, threw me the keys and said my car was parked out back and to go get it. And they charge $25 a day for this service, seriously!So, before I checked out today, I asked to speak to the manager (Jesse Gomez) after I received a bill for over $10,000 for my 4 day stay. He proceeded to tell me that they charged me for the original room as well as a $1,100 per day up charge plus taxes, to the tune of about $2,000 a day. This is completely unacceptable and I pulled up the website and the screen shot I took of the hotel if I had booked it online and it wasn't near this price. So, they were trying to charge me double the room price and my husband and I are Hilton Diamond members. Jesse said he would take off the valet charge ($25) and would look at the bill and email me the new bill, to which I still have not received. I have been traveling throughout Hawaii with my two daughters for the last 3 weeks, we have stayed at the Disney Aulani, Trump, Montage and Outrigger Beach and I must say this was the worst customer service I have ever received. I travel extensively each and every month, for business and pleasure and this is the first time I have ever been treated so poorly and with such dissatisfaction that I will never stay at a Hilton property again if they do not properly take care of this situation for me. ", " This is not Hawaii. Received an offer from Hilton Honors to receive a discounted Hilton Grand Vacations stay somewhere in Hawaii, the only condition being that we subjected ourselves to a time-share pitch... We couldn't get into an acceptable Waikiki beach location, so unfortunately we ended up trying the Waikoloa location, which was the Hilton Waikoloa Village Hotel (in one of their three Towers, the Ocean Tower). We had been to the Big Island (aka Hawaii Island) before on several occasions, so we did knew something about the island, but nothing about the Hilton Waikoloa. The self-parking was way too far from the hotel entrance, so we ended up parking in the valet parking. While checking in, the voice of the woman at the front desk was irritatingly high pitched and grating. We were told our room was in the \"Ocean Tower\" and we could get there by tram or by boat, so we made our way through the very crowded lobby to the tram/boat stop to wait...and wait... and wait, for the tram (the boat does not allow one to take luggage on board). While we were waiting for the tram, we noted that the atmosphere seemed to be more like one would expect of Disneyland rather than Hawaii (and that was so disappointing, as if we had wanted to go to Disneyland, we would have gone to Disneyland). After the tram eventually came and we managed to get our luggage on board, we took the very lengthy ride to the farthest of the hotel's three towers, the \"Ocean Tower.\" We made the walk from the final tram stop at the Mexican cantina restaurant to one of the elevators, up to the fourth floor and to our purportedly ocean view room. Once there, we found we could only see across a man-made looking lagoon to the lobby, hardly the ocean view for which we had paid a surcharge. Also, the room smelled like mildew or mold. A call to the lobby produced a response that there would be a change to some other \"ocean view\" room and we were to go to the concierge in the Ocean Tower to find out the room number and to obtain new card keys, which we did. After making our way all the way back to the concierge, we picked up our card keys and walked quite a distance to the elevator on a different side of the Ocean Tower, and made our way up to the fourth floor, and then walked an equally great distance just to get to our room. This room's view, which had an area under our balcony where something was being disassembled from a recent \"Wheel of Fortune\" video recording, and a golf course beyond that, also had in the distance an actual view of the ocean. We decided the ocean view was technically acceptable. The room smelled like mildew or mold, and was dated in appearance as was the first room, but we were getting tired of dragging our luggage around from room to room. There was also visible mold or mildew in the shower-over-tub. The ice machine on our floor was not working, which necessitated going to another floor's machine for ice. After a disturbed first night's sleep, we had to have the hotel plumber come and fix the intermittent, but regular, gurgling sounds emanating from the bathroom sink -- which was fixed upon the plumber's first visit. The \"concierge\" in the Ocean Tower did not know whether the change machine in the laundry room made change for anything over $1.00 bills, and getting to the laundry room entailed walking an incredibly long distance and then going down three flights of stairs. The Mexican cantina restaurant served what tasted to me like watered-down drinks (and I have never made that comment about anyplace, anywhere, ever), and the food at the cantina was fourth rate at best. Given the overpriced drinks, just stick to beer (a bottled beer would probably be the best advice from the point of view of what you are getting for your money). After two nights of disappointing experiences at the Mexican cantina, we tried the hotel's \"Italian\" restaurant as it was not more than a half-hour away via tram or boat. The pizza was mediocre, and when we inquired about a thin crust, the server responded that the crust was thin \"in the middle.\" (Yes, compared to the outside edges, I suppose any pizza other than a deep dish pizza would appear to be \"thin in the middle.\") The pizza was what could be described as tasting like an ordinary pizza, nothing beyond ordinary; however, the price was at least two or three times the price of mainland pizza. We quickly gave up on hotel restaurants and tried our luck elsewhere, which was a great idea -- restaurants away from the hotel have considerably better tasting food at significantly better prices. Since we had a rental car (part of the \"package\" for enduring the purportedly pressure-free time-share sales pitch), we eventually drove one or two miles away to King's shopping area where there was a Fish and Chips type place which was located on a lake (and also a Tiffany's and a Macy's if that is what you are looking for), but the food at the Fish and Chips was not particularly good. In the same shopping area was a Roy's, which was noisy and fairly good, with very good service. A 20-mile drive south back into Kailua-Kona there was a very reasonable harbor restaurant called \"Harbor House.\" Getting back to commenting on the Hilton Waikoloa, it took forever to get from the room to the tram or boat, and then one had to wait for the tram or boat, and then there was the lengthy wait and/or ride on either the tram or the boat just to get to the lobby from whence once could then escape this purportedly Hawaiian hotel, which wasn't Hawaiian at all (quite a bit of Asian art all over the place). Shame on this hotel for keeping its dolphins penned up in such a small area. There is no natural beach at this hotel. It takes forever to walk around this hotel, which is not good if one has, or is with someone who has, any sort of mobility difficulty. The maid service was not bad, except for the day that we accidentally left a do not disturb sign on our door most of the day and they never called our room and instead left a note saying that after 3:30 we were simply out of luck.I would wholeheartedly endorse most of the \"Terrible\" comments on this place, with the only exception being that we observed no ants or cockroaches in our room. We had everything else, including the noisy birds. Fortunately I travel with ear cancellation headphones and earplugs, so the birds were not a problem for me. I will say that I did not feel like I was in Hawaii while I stayed in this hotel. More importantly, even though I had paid for 6 nights at this hotel, we checked out after four nights (forfeiting two nights of paid lodging) and went up to the coast to another hotel where we had a beautiful Hawaiian experience. I will never stay at this hotel again, nor do I intend to stay at any Hilton hotel. ", " The layout of this hotel will ruin your stay. The cost will make you wonder what you are paying for. The remoteness to other attractions will force you to drive everywhere. The tacky rundown decor will make you cringe. HOTEL LAYOUT: It took us 15 minutes to get from the parking lot to our room, and we are fast, fit walkers. If we had waited for the tram it would have been over 30 minutes. The poor layout of this hotel means you have to walk a long ways to get anywhere \u2013 breakfast, the pool, the ocean side, the putting green, the lobby, the fitness center\u2026 they are all inconvenient. The tram is SLOW and runs only sporadically.OVERPRICED: Breakfast buffet was $30, \u00bd an hour rental of the kayak was $30, $9 cappuccinos\u2026. The $25 resort fee was supposed to include classes, but those too were $15. None of the facilities, restaurants or food items were worth the amount they charged even considering Hawaiian prices. The internet was slow no matter what time of the day you or from where you accessed it.REMOTE LOCATION: This resort is surrounded by nothing but lava fields. Most of the good restaurants, golf courses, attractions, excursions and scenic spots require you to leave the Hilton property and drive to them. We were here in the slow season, and traffic was bad then. It was 30 minutes to the airport. 45 minutes to Kailua-Kona\u2026. My 11 & 13 year old played for a few hours in the resort pool and Lagoon and then were ready for something else.TACKY AND RUN DOWN: The grounds have been littered with 100\u2019s of tacky statues detracting from the natural beauty of the area. Statues like rhinos and hippos do nothing to make this feel like a Hawaiian resort. The grounds are full of feral cats. Near the ocean\u2019s edge, the black lava is covered graphite created with white-rock, ruining the view. The room we stayed at in the Ocean tower had a hodge-podge of 5 different styles of furniture.VASTLY DIFFERENT ROOM QUALITY: Our first room was in the ocean tower. It had a musty, wet smell. The bed was creaky, even a slight movement made the bed shake. The fake woven-grass wall paper was warped. The door was so ill fitting we could hear everyone who walked by. The worst was the birds that occupy the trees in the interior gardens \u2013 they screeched from sundown to sunup, making it very difficult to sleep. We were moved to a room in the Lagoon tower. This had the interior quality I expect from a Hilton. It had modern, matching furniture. The bed was the comfortable. The towels were plush and the decorations tactful. However, it still had odd noises from the resort boat that cruises by.LOUSY HILTON HONOR GOLD BENEFITS: Hilton Honor Gold membership means practically nothing at this resort. I did receive an \u201cupgrade\u201d from a resort view to a partial ocean view. That room was so bad, I dread to think what the resort view rooms would be like. We each received a coupon for ONE bottle of water. We also received a $10 coupon towards breakfast. This was a joke, considering the breakfast buffet costs $30. This resort did not even come close to living up to the other nice Hilton properties I have stayed at around the world. If you want to use or acquire Hilton points stay at one of the condos nearby.GOOD THINGS: The rooms were large and clean. They had a small fridge. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. ", " I stayed at this hotel last May for a business conference and never will I ever return. The hotel is absolutely massive and it takes almost 30 minutes to walk from one end to the other. There is a tram service that is offered however it goes about as fast as a 100-year-old with a walker. After around 7pm, the place reminded me of an abandoned old folks home during the apocalypse. Minimal entertainment and lousy/expensive food. Need I mention the main attraction of this god awful place is a \"swim with the dolphins\" pen where about 20 dolphins are kept in an area no bigger than a backyard swimming pool. It's a real tragedy that a world renowned chain like the Hilton offers such an archaic activity. The captivity industry is fuelled by places like this. I urge you to avoid if you stay here! If you stay here, be sure to smuggle in some bottles of wine so as to not pay the $15 a glass at the bars. There is also NO beach access, the car rental service is double what it would be elsewhere, so if you're not willing to shell out the $250 a day for a car the chances of you seeing a beach are slim to none.My recommendation - stay closer to Kona, it's a delightful town with much more to offer!!! ", " I wish I could put 0 stars.. We stayed in both the Palace Tower & the Ocean Tower. I'm just going to list off the things that happened:- Upon checking in, had a rude front desk experience. Nothing was explained to us about the property layout, we were not given a map, or a DVD now card. The resort fee was not explained to us, but at least I expected it.- Someone offered to bring our bags to the room, he piled them up outside and walked away. I went outside to see who was looking after my bags. Waited for 5 minutes, no one was around. My husband and I picked up our bags and no one noticed. So I guess anyone could've taken them!- Palace Tower, walked into a musty smelling room, the smell never left! We kept the door open, tried to air it out, asked housekeeping about it, they said the whole building smelled the same.The positive about staying in the Palace Tower, it only takes 25 minutes to get to the lobby on the tram!- Ocean Tower, at least 30 minutes to get to the lobby on the tram. Yesterday, the tram got there, we sat in it, it didn't move for 12 minutes!!! Then move on to the Palace tower, 10 minutes!!! So 22 minutes just in waiting! But before it got to our tower, we had waited over 20 minutes. I have a foot injury and can't walk long distances, so I have to rely on the tram. - Pizza Delivery... 10$ charge for delivery! The food was terrible, and it cost over $50. - Room Service, even though they were very polite, the food was bland and I was not given any condiments.. so yeah, that dinner was horrible!- The pools are not the cleanest.- There's a tree in the center of Ocean Tower that hundreds of super loud birds congregated multiple times a day, including the middle of the night. Woke me up every single night we were here. I know it's hard to control birds, but coming to a resort to not sleep, not ideal!- Called for valet 5 minutes before leaving our room, took 35 minutes to get to the lobby, we expected our car there! Nope, were asked to wait another 15-20 minutes. Finally, at 55 minutes of waiting, our car arrived. We were visibly upset, the valet laughed at us! Thanks for that!- Sat in the bar outside the ocean tower, the tables were dirty and sticky. My mai tai was about 5 ounces, $12. It was terrible and I only drank about 1/3.THE BED IS HORRIBLE!!! The bed frame is in a diagonal in the corner of the room, the head board is about a foot higher than the mattress, so you can't sit in bed and read or whatever. The head board will drive into your back, try to use pillows, nope! So you decide to sit on the sofa, it smelled like my grand-mother's basement sofa that she hadn't aired out in 40 years. Disgusting!!!The shopping just outside the hotel is pretty great. If I were to come back to Waikoloa, I would definitely stay at the Marriott or find another property. We've been in Hawaii for 3 weeks, this is the only place we had issues. We loved every other hotel we stayed at. This place has completely turned me off of Hilton. ", " Our trip was for 2 adults + 2 kids 6 nights + 7 the night free w/luau. We got to the hotel and the front desk said it was for 2 luau only and we had pay $57 each for the kids to go. No where in our Expedia reservation did it say it was for only 2 luau's- and trust me we read the \"fine print\" thoroughly. The Hilton refused to honor this and we were forced to pay it. I was furious and we will never stay there again. Plus the $20 per night parking is ridiculous, shop around since most hotels don't require a huge parking fee. We also were not given a choice on towers as a few reviews said you get. They said our only choice was the palace tower or we could pay an extra $175 to upgrade to the lagoon tower. We are not picky guests and travel a lot, but the Hilton Waikoloa really disappointed us. ", " I booked my honeymoon at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I was never told until we checked in that the Wheel of Fortune game show would be onsite filming. They asked us to move rooms and pay more and we got a room with the game show lights shining in our room all night and all the horrible sounds of a game show! We couldn't sit on our balcony or even keep the door or curtains open because of the light and noise. VERY disappointed with Hilton!!! We should have been told when we booked so we could have chosen a different date. ", " Don't stay here unless you would like to be treated like an unwanted guest. My second experience at a Hilton and an awful one at that. At check-in, I was advised that I could not change rooms to be closer to my friends' rooms, who were in a different tower. My room was faux clean when I walked in. The table and phone were covered in cracker crumbs and the carpet had little scraps of tissue and trash. Vacuum ever? There was mold in the shower head, faucet (lots), and wall. The shower curtain was dirty. The refrigerator didn't work. The air conditioning was loud. I couldn't move rooms, so what a nice night I had. No one asked me how my stay or room was, and I was too disgusted to use the rest of the facilities. A complete waste of money. ", " Nothing says Aloha! like the extra $25 daily room fee or the $19 self parking ($25) for valet. The dining option are nice, but again the cost are quite excessive. They even know it since when you check in you can buy a \"discount\" card (for only $30) that gives you a 10% discount at their establishments. My wife and I come to Hawaii for our anniversary regularly, 9 times in the lat 17 years. We will never stay at this resort again. ", " Just came back from a 5 day trip at the Hilton Waikoloa. Slept in room with 1 king and a sofa bed with my wife and 2 kids. I slept in the sofa bed in the second night, and began to develop and itch all around my legs. Then turned to bumps. Thought it was just mosquito bites. My wife then slept in the same sofa bed second to last night. She started to develop itch and bumps on the way home. Got home, and she had bed bug bites all over. Called the Waikoloa front desk and they said management will get back to us. Sent an email to Hilton, with no response. 2 days has passed, and no response. We will report to the CDC and upload photos of bed bug bites all over social media. No rationale why management has no cares about future guests. ", " We spent a week at the Disney Aulani which isn't cheap by any means but felt like a good value. The Hilton was expensive for the sake of being expensive. The \"free\" DVD rental system was an exercise in patience. Most discs didn't work. The rentals kiosks barely worked (failed to read the card). Went through a couple sets of room keys - the front desk said we kept demagnetizing them but even fresh keys would fail.Hotel lacked an attention to detail that I would have expected for the price. Dirty / tattered elevator ceilings, same for the hallway carpets. Disliked the stay enough that I canceled and walked over to the Marriott after 4 nights. ", " This hotel is primarily designed for families. We were booked at this hotel as part of an extended stay from a Perillo tour. We visited Oahu, Maui, and Kauai first, and decided to add the Big Island to our package. Needless to say this hotel is a disappointment compared to the accommodations at the Hyatt hotels we stayed in on the other islands. The properties here are vast. It is crowded and service is not the Aloha feel of all the other islands. The rooms feel dirty and musty. Definitely not a place for older adults or anyone with a walking disability. The tram service they offer is slow, you can walk faster. Not the way I wanted to end my stay in Hawaii. ", " If you like having to ride a tram or boat to get anywhere on the resort, than this is the place. This place was poorly designed for elderly or disable. Rooms are out dated, and smell like wet dirty carpet. You'll need to walk a mile to find the 2 elevators per floor, and a map to find the one and only hot tub. ", " So if you are looking for a massive resort where you will spend a ton of time walking, searching desperately for a chair without a towel, standing in lines to ride a water slide, dealing with overworked unhappy staff, while spending huge sums of money on sub par food . . . then this is your spot!!On top of all of that, you feel like you are trying to figure out the nickel and dime game the whole time. Get that 10% discount card, but don't forget to bring it!! Buy the blue cups for cheaper refills, but they are only good at one spot. Don't forget your towel card! Need a nice spot to sit since every available chair is filled. Sure, the staff won't move those towels, but they will offer you a rental seat for $50. Etc., etc. Why can't they just charge a fair price and make it easy?Kona is known for coffee, but the restaurants don't serve it at the Hilton. There is a coffee bar, but it opens late and closes early. I guess I am the only guy that needs a recharge after 5pm??And on the topic of strange hours. The water slide closes at 6:30pm. The pool is jammed and my kid is 14th in line and they just turn the water off. No clue why. Certainly not demand.Rent a car, get out and enjoy what HI is really all about. The island is amazing and we enjoyed our time away from the resort. We will be back to HI, but not to the Hilton. ", " Hilton Waikoloa, the biggest resort on Hawaii (as they say) has no restaurant open after 22:00 except the chineese until 22:45. So if you're checking in late like we did, you'd better like cantoneese rice or wait for breakfast time...When we arrived in the room around 23:00 (took time with the train to reach the place), the sofabed was not installed, we had only 2 towels and 9 hangers for 3 people. The room was very small, furnitures & deco outdated and the sofabed matress comfort definitely not OK, clearly a not appropriate combination for that range of price. When talking with the manager, I've been told that I got what we paid for (!) and rooms are arranged upon arrival, so basically nothing to complain about (hopefully we did not arrive even later).Last but not least, to park your car, it will cost you min $17 per night, a perfect trap that makes a lot of money.No doubt, at Hilton Waikoloa, they know how to make you feel like at home ! Will be my last time with them. ", " We decided to spend part of our vacation here (1) out of curiosity about its famous size and having been carved out of a barren lava field , and (2) it's \"Solid Gold Value\" rating from Wizard Publications. We regretted it on arrival. The horrifically big parking lot screams inconvenience, crowding and hot cars. The lobby was a mess of unruly guests. Both rooms we tried had good ocean views that were marred by 24/7 mechanical noise from outdoors (water pumps, HVAC?) reminiscent of the hum one hears from neighboring apartment buildings in a big city. Room also had unpleasant smell and was badly dated. KPC monchong was good but mahi-mahi was too dry. KPC ambiance was inferior to other places we tried further up the coast--noiser, more people, less space. Layout is weird--one end of the property has multiple pools but no hot tubs. We swam in the shade of the grotto-like section of the Kona pool--fun feature but way too crowded. We knew it was a bad base for excursions but wanted to get out a little anyway--forget something in your room or at the other end of the property at your peril--you may feel tired, rushed or both. Hardly any of the art is Hawaii-themed; the designers seem obsessed with Nara or Kamakura, and even our friends from that part of the world found that aspect eerie and unpleasant. The kicker was the larger-than-life human-bodied, Chinese-zodiac-animal headed set of twelve statues spooking up the Kohala Pool. Dolphins fun to watch. Best feature is lagoon, offering quick access to snorkeling in protected water with sea turtles and a good variety of fish. Light pollution unfavorable for stargazing. Trams and boats mildly amusing for children but not pleasant--former feel cramped and have repetitive recorded commentary, latter have engine noise and smells and are tracked. Both are hardly faster than walking. Resort fee was useless to us, since we didn't even have time to arrange for the portrait and all other items it is said to cover were not of interest. Cockroaches in room. Huge cockroach flying around us in tram. Unconcerned hotel response: \"It's a tropical environment and they are out.\" Something is keeping this place in business, and this may be a clue: we encountered both (a) bands of roving teenagers at night, and (b) parents blissfully, almost proudly unaware of where their children's whereabouts. ", " Although undeniably beautiful, this hotel is so over-the-top and unnecessarily wasteful. it disgusted me. To begin, they have a pool where they keep 10 or 12 dolphins and use it to make pure profit with no consideration for the animals who are taken from their families and homes for the sole purpose of generating a profit. how is that justifiable? secondly, unless youre a million stay away, because on top of the insanely expensive nightly costs, everything there is more than double it should be.stay away if you have any morals and concern for the environment.theyre evil!!!!! ", " If you want to save yourself some time, don't read this review... just stay somewhere else. - Long Walk to the Lobby:The hotel is so large that they need transportation between the lobby, where your car is parked, and your hotel room but the tram is not always in service. According to my pedometer, a round-trip from our room to our car and back is just about 1.5 miles! It's okay to walk once or twice a day but if you forget something in your car or in your room, it's a miserable experience. Plan for an extra 30 - 45 minutes to get anywhere early in the morning or late at night when the transportation is out of service. Don't come here if you have any trouble getting around. Fortunately, my husband and I are not disabled but I can't imagine staying here if we were. Nothing is open late: We tried to get a drink at night but everything was closed at 11:00pm. - Restaurants + \"Luau\":The restaurants are super expensive but that's to be expected at a resort. What's unexpected, is the low-quality food even at the nicest restaurant at the hotel. The Luau was a joke. Do not go! Terrible quality food and not at all authentic.The service overall was average at best and the rooms were just okay. - Animal Cruelty:They have \"Dolphin Quest\" at the hotel. Look this company up for yourself. They have a terrible reputation. You don't have to be an animal lover to feel sorry for the way Hilton and Dolphin Quest treat these animals. We will never stay at another Hilton again because of what we saw. The living conditions are horrendous. The \"kiddie pool\" is larger than the facility which houses the dolphins. After the dolphin facility was closed in the evening, we sat at the restaurant nearby and watched the dolphins swim in small circles over and over while they practically beached themselves trying to get around in the shallow body of water. It's unnatural and just sick! These animals belong in the ocean or at the very least, in a much larger facility. In case you don't care about animals: I'd just barely give this hotel 3 stars if it weren't for the dolphin facility. - Hawaii Overall:The trip to Hawaii was absolutely wonderful overall and I'm so glad we came to the island but next time we will stay elsewhere... probably at a hotel in Kailua-Kona. It's a fun little town with a ton of great restaurants all within walking distance. I loved this place! I can't wait to come back. :-)Have a great vacation! ", " This place is gigantic. It has a train that is supposed to take you from one end to the other but it's pretty useless because by the time it comes around and makes all of it's stops to get you to your location, you could be in your car and driving off already. The room was hot and smelly and we had to crank the AC to 60 to make it tolerable. The toilet didn't work. We called someone, twice, but nobody every showed up. So we had to turn the toilet on and off ourselves just to not hear the god awful noise it makes. The room needed some serious updating. We had a view of someone else's balcony. And the parking... We got a card to swipe in and out of the lot but it NEVER worked. We had to call someone every time we wanted to come in or out. Good luck finding the pools and stuff. You can seriously get lost here. The entire decor of the property is all Asian inspired. Even the architecture. I don't know about you, but on my visit to Hawaii, I expected to see more things Hawaiian and Polynesian inspired art and decor. There's a dolphin tank that's smaller than my house. Dolphins have the roaming radius of the entire planet not covered in land. They have no business in a little tank like that. Breaks my heart to pieces. Honestly if I would have known that, I would never have given them my money to stay here. This place was built to pack in as many people as possible to make as much money as possible.My husband and I went to the luau at the marriott and this place was very nice, quaint, on the beach with a pool that you could clearly find and didn't need a compass to get to; we were kicking ourselves for not staying here. We wish we would have known before we booked our stay just how ridiculous this hotel is. ", " I surprised the family with a Hawaiian vacation for Christmas, and as a Hilton HHonors Diamond member, I chose the Hilton Waikoloa Village. The property is definitely beautiful, but it is absolutely HUGE. They have a tram to shuttle you around the resort, but it is really slow and makes multiple stops adding 30 mins each way to whatever you want to do. Breakfast was only served in one location, so it took us 30 mins to breakfast and 30 minutes back to room after to change and get your stuff for the day. This completely wasted the morning.The most important thing to know here though is that THERE IS NO BEACH! The photos show a \"beach\", but it's a tiny strip of sand on their own small \"lagoon\". The resort map even shows a white area that looks like a beach, but when you get there you find out that it is actually just rock. They get away with making it look like a beach on the map by saying that it is actually coral and not rock. Yeah, I'm sure that's why they made it look like a beach on the map.I complained to management about the breakfast location and also asked why they don't clearly indicate that there is no real beach here. They totally blew me off without so much as throwing a free drink my way or anything. I was pretty shocked by this as I was a Hilton HHonors Diamond member (their highest tier). They gave me some BS about how this property is the highest redemption property for HHonors members as if that somehow made it better? It is the highest redemption property because they completely mislead you about what you are getting.Needless to say, I will never stay here again. On top of that, I have since switched allegiance completely away from Hilton and will take my substantial business and personal hotel stays to a competitor. ", " Terrible service, dirty rooms with roaches and AC that did not work. Staff that was understaffed and could care less. Seems like everyone was going through the motions. If you have a choice, stay somewhere else...unless you like no AC, roaches, terrible service, dirty common areas and transportation that does not work! ", " THIS PLACE IS FOR THE BIRDS! Let me preface my review by saying that my family (hubby, me, and 2 kids) stayed at the HWV as part of a corporate event. The company covered the cost of the room and basic meal costs for my husband and me during the days of the event. We arrived early so we did pay for many things on our own.  We spent 6 exhausting and expensive days at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Let me fill you in on some of the disappointments we experienced: -THE BIRDS! Our room was on the 5th floor of the \u201cOcean Tower\u201d (no ocean view) which was located directly across from the tops of the trees that grow in the courtyard of the tower. In the tops of these trees live birds. Lots of noisy squawking birds. The night we arrived it was super windy and I just assumed that the birds were upset that their homes were swaying so violently because every time a huge gust of wind would come up the birds would begin their screeching and squawking. It went on like this for most of the night with a brief period of quiet and then they started up again at about 4:45 am. I was so tired and angry the next morning and we called down to see if we could get another room, but nothing was available. We had to stick it out in that room for the next 4 nights, which were no different, and get ear plugs in order to keep our sanity. My 8 year old lost his ear plugs EVERY NIGHT and I would give him mine, so I got to listen to the bird racket all night long. I think that it would be a nice touch for the management to provide a complimentary slingshot with some large rocks in order for guests to feel like there is some solution to this problem. I absolutely LOVE animals but I think something needs to be done to relocate these creatures to somewhere where hundreds of people aren\u2019t trying to sleep. When we asked the concierge for earplugs, they didn\u2019t ask why - they obviously didn't care.Our room- It was small and dirty to begin with. It had 2 double beds. What? I can\u2019t remember ever staying in a hotel that didn\u2019t have at least 2 queens. Maybe I\u2019m spoiled because I normally sleep in a king at home but I think that child sized beds are unreasonable, particularly in a resort. We did manage to get a rollaway bed for one of the kids, but I still got to \u201cenjoy\u201d snuggling with my snoring husband all night in our small bed, which I really wasn\u2019t in the mood for after listening to hours of bird screeching. The d\u00e9cor in our room was old and tired. The wallpaper was peeling and the lampshades looked original to the construction of the resort. There was a thick layer of dust everywhere, including all around the base of the carpet. The sofa was so dirty that I wouldn\u2019t let my kids sit on it. The safe didn\u2019t work. The faucet handles kept falling off in my hand. There was mold in the shower. The water tasted like it was pumped directly from the shower or toilet. There was no way I was going to make coffee in that room and was forced to purchase coffee from the coffee shop every morning at $6+ a cup. The sheets and towels were dingy and didn\u2019t look or smell clean. I could go on and on\u2026-The Grounds \u2013 I will say that the grounds were nice and clean and well manicured and had lots of interesting (quiet) birds and even the occasional mongoose. I heard a few cat-haters complaining about the feral cats that roam the grounds. I have never been to a tropical resort that did NOT have cats. Cats = No rats. They are fed and cared for and some of them are friendly. Someone should find a way to get the cats up to the tree tops and introduce them to the birds.  -Food/Beverages. You might want to consider selling a kidney before coming if you plan on eating here. As I said, we were part of a corporate event for our visit and some of our food expenses were covered by the company. If we wanted a \u201cbeer\u201d you could choose from Bud of Michelob or a mixed drink with the watered down liquor they have. On a few occasions we opted to pay an additional amount to upgrade to a \u201cpremium brand\u201d liquor\u2026.for $8 a drink. I cannot imagine how much they would cost if we were paying for the entire amount! The on-site food is OK. When you\u2019re in Hawaii it\u2019s hard to resist the temptation to go to a Luau, right? Resist you must !! We got in mid-day and I saw the little brochure and thought it looked like fun so my dear, sweet husband booked a reservation for our family that night. As I mentioned, it was terribly windy and the whole experience was a nightmare. It was cold and everything was blowing everywhere. People\u2019s food was blowing off their plates as they served themselves in the buffet line and drinks were tipping over at the table. I had to eat with one hand on my cup the entire time. My kids were tired and cranky and cold and I decided that we should just leave early and get to bed. My husband was resistant to this idea but ultimately gave in. It wasn\u2019t until later that I understood why he wanted to stay. The Luau for 4 cost (you might want to sit down) - $458. I\u2019m not kidding. Had I known that, I would have stayed to the very end and froze my butt off and gotten every penny out of the experience. I love my husband but sometimes its Ok to tell me no. Really! Let\u2019s see\u2026breakfast buffet $95\u2026taco lunch for 4 $120. Seriously? There were several times we wanted to eat onsite that we couldn\u2019t even get a seat at the restaurants unless we stood right next to a table and stared at the people that were currently using it like vultures waiting for them to die. We ended up eating at the little Italian restaurant with a pizza and salad buffet just to get some food. We had a decent meal at Kamuela Provision Company but had to wait for 45 mins for a table despite having a reservation. Do yourself a favor \u2013 dine off site. We ate at Tommy Bahama\u2019s and Merriman\u2019s and had really great meals and excellent service. Well worth the drive!On to the pools! There are several small pools with a few chairs and slides and one large one with a really fun slide. If you plan to swim, plan to claim your chair Hunger Games style . If you\u2019re there when the pools open and make a mad dash to the cornucopia ( I mean the towel desk) and have your entire family lay on your chairs to claim them you might get a seat or two. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to be standing at the pool and watching your kids swim while jealously eyeing the chairs that are just sitting there with towels on them, but no one apparently using them. There\u2019s no pool service so if you want a drink or some food be prepared to nominate someone from your family to go get it. DO NOT ABANDON YOUR CHAIR!!!! We got up to get a quick lunch one day (because I figured it might be irresponsible to leave my kids alone in the pool) and I came back to find some jerk had taken my towels \u2013 WITH my belongings (sunscreen, googles etc) and balled them up and thrown them off to the side and taken my chairs. The pools are really cold by the way. I only ever got in up to my waist. I did enjoy sitting at the bottom of the slide and watching the folks that had not been in the water yet enter the pool and gasp and scream because it was cold. I know, I\u2019m evil. I\u2019m ok with it. The Tram - The tram takes FOREVER!!!!!! Please, if you have somewhere you need to be, plan on walking and wear comfortable shoes. This is not the time to break in those cute new shoes you got for your vacation. It\u2019s a good long walk from one end of the resort to the other (like 20 minutes) but think of it this way \u2013 you\u2019re saving yourself from getting robbed to use their gym. :)The Beach - We had a great time at the beach! What beach, you ask? Not the beach at the HWV!!!! They have a little lagoon area that is crawling with people that doesn\u2019t even face the ocean. No thanks! We loaded up the kids and took a 15 minute drive or so to Hapuna Beach and had a great time. Warm water, lots of space. No chair service but we didn\u2019t have any at the pool either so didn\u2019t feel like we were missing anything. Speaking of chairs, there is a guy that will rent you a beach chair on the side of the road before you get to the beach.Those are my major complaints about the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I left feeling exhausted and disappointed. We ran up a bill of over $2000 (which did include a few nights at the kids club) and that was with the company paying for the basics. I assure you that we didn\u2019t go crazy at the bar or restaurants. I would suggest that you simply do not stay there. If you must, like we had to, plan ahead and you may end up having a better time than we did. The island itself is amazing and beautiful so rent a car if you can (and plan on paying the $17 daily parking fee) and get out and see it. I want to add that we have stayed at plenty of fabulous and not-so-fabulous hotels and resorts. I have NO problem paying more for quality and service, but we didn\u2019t get either of those things, or even the basics like cleanliness and quiet. This HWV is huge but it lacks the ability to accommodate all of the guests that it can squeeze into it\u2019s many rooms. That is just unacceptable to me and I will NEVER come back. ", " This hotel was not what was expected when we first arrived. First of all, if you do decide to stay here ask for a room in the Lagoon Tower. The rooms at the Palace Tower and Ocean Tower are extremely dated. I was told that the Lagoon Tower had been renovated. When we arrived, we were taken to our room at the Palace Tower. We were surprised by how dated the room looked so we asked for another room in another tower. The room just looked dirty even though it was cleaned. We were then taken to the Ocean Tower. Not that much better but we were tired at this point and could not get a room in the Lagoon Tower. When we got to our room at the Ocean Tower, there was mildew on the tub and shower head. My son found used baby food packets underneath the bed. We called immediately to have the room cleaned. They took awhile to clean it.As others have said this is a huge property. There is not really a beach just swimming pools at Ocean and Lagoon Tower. Be warned the pools are COLD. I mean really cold. My son did not even want to stay in the pool for more than an hour.The service was slow and unfriendly at times. Also BE WARNED if you stay in the Ocean Tower, there is Bird Noise at night.We will not be coming back to this hotel again. ", " After checking in for my brothers wedding they put us in the wrong rooms on the wrong side of the resort. Due to some event they had on there was nowhere to eat we were actually told by the pool staff that they could no longer service us as they were to busy. The breakfast reminded me of something that i had seen on a prison movie....slops i think they called that. Worst food ever!!! No help from any staff. Do yourself a favor and never go there!!!! ", " I have stayed at Hilton Waikoloa during Spring break, reserved one of the nice Makai rooms with Dolphin/beach view. After flying for almost 15 hours, leaving from Miami, and having a 6 hours time zone difference we finally arrived at our room. When we were going to bed, at around 10:00pm local time(04:00am for us!), We realized our sheets had a big BLOOD STAIN and hair all over! I called housekeeping and asked them for a clean sheet set.I explained that I had a long flight and if they could expedite the sheets delivery, since it was their mistake to leave the bed like that. They told me they were very busy and that I would have to wait. After 40 minutes and no sheets I called again and they told me it was on the way.Half an hour later no sheets! I called again, spoke to Jean(if that is really her name) and told her my frustration and irritation on waiting for over an hour for clean sheets. MY MISTAKE COMPLAINING, I had to wait another hour for Jean to send the sheets!On the plus side the property is huge and nice, with a nice breakfast. They should focus on bettering service ", " Let me start that the bad experience start from check in..-Inexperienced staff at check in ,she is standing HHONORS check in desk.She does not ask for HHONOR number to be added to the reservation.Does not give any information about the directions to room .Hand over some maps.- Gold members does not get complimentary breakfast at this property.- This is not BEACHFRONT property,it is OCEANFRONT property.They have their own small lagoon beach but in Hawaii you are for ocean beach not the hotel created artificial beach.will likely be checking out and moving to Marriott hotel- which is beachfront property and standard rooms are much better. ", " I stayed here with a number of co-workers. Four of us had roaches in our rooms at different times throughout our stay. I came home with about 3 dozen bed bug bites (see photos). I hope I didn't bring any home. Won't be going back to the Hilton Waikoloa...ever. ", " This week end was saposed to be an awesome experance. My family and I don't get to vacation much. Let alone get a day off. Due to my husband and I owning and running a business. This weekend was not exactly that. Arrival was great we were able to check in early and the staff in the lobby was awesome. After we got settled we went to the pool for sun and fun. And we're greeted with a roach in the pool. Understanding that things like bugs aren't to be helped in a tropical location we simply found a staff member and asked if he could remove it. His responce was \" that's not my job\". Shortly after we were met with a woman sweeping the water on the only working bathroom at the pool. And all was fine till the moment I tryed to step out of her way. I guess I was disrupting her because I was rewarded with toilet water being swept onto my legs and feet. I'll Stop at there and leave with saying the only thing good about this vacation and experance was having the family together. Next time were taking our vacation else where ", " We always stay at the Marriott Waikoloa Next to the Hilton. But had heard a lot of hype about the Hilton next door so we gave it a try.. First bad was we had the \"pleasure\" of walking by the open service door everyday as we walked to our room. Viewing dirty laundry and house cleaning supplies does NOT elude to a luxury experience. Can't they simply SHUT THE DOOR!We did NOT enjoy the long train ride to our room nor the \"Disney-esk\" aspect of the property.. Tropical resort? Or Disneyland? Not for us. It took 20 minutes for our transport to our room.Eating on property was expensive and sub-optimal.Waiting for your bags? It took three phone calls and over an hour for our luggage to arrive after check in. On check out they were able to estimate that our luggage would be available within 45 minutes of pick up at the front desk. We recommend bringing your swim gear in your carry on to alleviate 'waiting\" to begin your vacay. And self-transport back to the front desk on check out.This hotel may ne perfect for thosee seeking the Disney experience (a line to a line to a line) but it wasnt for us. ", " We have stayed here before maybe 6-7 years ago. My kids loved this resort and both my husband and I also liked it, a very expensive price to pay. Well my son pasted away a couple months ago, we just thought it would be nice to celebrate his birthday at his favorite place to be. We booked a room which was nice but we have been infested with roaches. I complained twice to the front desk, they said they were going to take care of it. But the next day again roaches on the desk in the dresser. I had a bunch that was in my purse, which I was so disgusted, I threw it out..I was so paranoid of leaving anything out.. I had my husband go to the desk to complain. He spoke to a manager. He had the look of shock and said that he was going to send someone there to take care of it. He didn't offer anything like change our rooms or anything other than free breakfast? We just ate as we told him.. And that was the only thing he was willing to do for us. The next day as we began to pack our things up, I had to make sure we weren't bring any of the roaches home with us. They were coming out during the day, all over the place,I don't know what the heck they did, but it made it worse. I was so disappointed, this hotel/ resort is so expensive, a charge for everything plus service fee..and the rooms had roaches.. Never ever staying back there again.. Even my daughter that loved this placed in the past would not return..would not recommend this place unless you want to bring home some tiny visitors from Hawaii.. ", " This resort is basically a 'disney' type of resort. There is nothing romantic or natural about it. It is all very contrived. Don't waste your time or money while you are in Hawaii, in fact, staying here you won't even feel like you are IN Hawaii. This is more of a compound where you are encouraged to take trams, very limited beach access. ", " We have stayed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and really enjoyed it. We had heard that this Hilton was even nicer. It was a great disappointment. The hotel in in bad need of an update. Our first room was dark, had no view and several of the appliances did not work. After complaining and a long wait, we were given a second room that was worse. The desk staff that \"served\" us consistently broke promises of help and only when we got the name of the manager, Debi Bishop, were we properly served. After a half-day wait, our third room was acceptable.The grounds are very nice but there are so many problems with this place that we will not return.

We were billed incorrectly which leads me to belive they do this all the time. We would never stay here again or reccommend. Beach towels are really little bath towels.

The hotel itself was very nice BUT. BAD- very expensive and can definitely get better value for money- isolated and have to drive minimum of 20 mins to go anywhere- food was horrible in every eatery except KPC but very expensive. $250 dinner for 2- beds were 2 doubles (barely doubles) with no other option. After complaining they did comp us 2 roll away beds for kids but wanted to charge $30 each per night.- messed up dates of several reservations we had- kids club was about $135 for 2 kids for 5 hrs.- hiring of all water equip was very expensive- service was definitely not what you would expect from a Hilton- village too big and 10 min walk to get to lobby if you are in end towers. They do have trams and boats to get you around but long waits, slow & boats often not running.GOOD- facilities but once again expensive to do anything.We never write reviews but wanted to warn others of this place as it pretty much put a massive dampener on our holiday. Very nice place but I would shop around and look for something in town for half the price and closer to everything. Stayed here for 5 nights and could not wait to leave then stayed at Hilton in Waikiki for 5 nights and not impressed either. Have not stayed at a Hilton before and will never again.Big island itself is a big let down in our opinion. Lots of lava rock and nothing else. ", " The ocean view was not ocean view. Resort was so big that I should walk a lot. Room condition was not so clean, Workers were not kind. despite the complaint, they were neglected. It was uncomfortable, unkind, unpleaseant, unclean, expensive resort. ", " Outside area is nice, staff is unfriendly; they act like they're doing you a favor by answering questions about the hotel... the rooms, they are so ran down you might as well stay in a Motel 6! I would never take my family to a Hilton hotel again. ", " Hilton has a timeshare property near the hotel and they offer a \"discount\" on the hotel if you consent to attend a presentation on the timeshare. We got snookered by the discount. The main problem with the hotel is that it is located far away from most of the beautiful spots on the island. So you will spend a lot of time on the road. There are no good restaurants nearby - just chains like Macaroni grill. If you are not into golfing there is little else to do in the hotel which is in the hottest part of the island. There is no direct beach access unlike other resorts and the pool water is often too cold (due to some malfunction). The service is not the best and there are all kinds of additional charges for parking, resort fees etc. Staying at Kona and at Hilo for a few days would be a better way to explore the island and will provide more bang for the buck. ", " DO NOT STAY HERE! The property is fine (if you like an imitation Disneyland in Hawaii), but the service is terrible. If you want to stay in a building with any amenities (e.g. a pool or restaurant or a room that doesn't have feral cats trying to get in), expect to pay for it! ", " TERRIBLE. This resort is good if you want to just hang out at the resort and enjoy man-made attractions like the lagoon or the fake canal with the boat. Or you could just go to Disneyland; airfare, food and lodging would be much cheaper. When I go to Hawaii I want to see nature, go where the locals go, eat where the locals eat, and play where the locals play. I don't want to take a boat ride in a fake canal or swim in a man-made lagoon or sun tan in a man-made beach.Let me count the ways I hate this resort:1. LocationThis is my first trip to the Big Island, so I wasn't familiar with the different regions. Waikoloa (with the exception of the tiny actual Waikoloa Village, 6 miles up towards the mountain) basically is full of resorts, and Hilton Waikoloa Village is one of them. The airport is 19 miles away. Kailua-Kona is about 30 miles south. The next town up north would be Waimea (more inland, towards the mountain) about 15 miles away. In other words, Waikoloa is in the middle of nowhere. Food is scarce unless you want to go to Macaroni Grill, Ruth Chris, or expensive but sucky hotel restaurants. Many end up buying food from the local grocery store, which is decent if you don't care about good quality food.If I ever come back to the Big Island, I would definitely stay in Kona area. That's where most of the excellent snorkeling spots are, as well as local restaurants and shops. You can get a meal for as low as $9.50 in Kona (example: Da Poke Shack, yum!), while in Waikoloa you'd spend at least $20 for something similar with only 10% of the choices you'd have in Kona.There is a real local town, Waikoloa Village, which is 6 miles away from the resort. It was a good breakfast place and a couple of restaurants that have decent prices. But for a 10-day stay, we wanted variety and end up driving to Kailua-Kona almost every day.2. Resort size and ease of getting in and outThe resort is HUGE! And whoever designed the resort is a moron because it takes forever to get in and out. Let me elaborate. There are I think 5 different buildings. When I booked I had no idea I would end up at the third building. The tram that goes back and forth from one end to another runs every 20 minutes. TWENTY MINUTES! Who has time to wait that long when you're on vacation??? So we end up walking the 0.5 mile 90% of the time, with our snorkeling gears, backpacks, groceries, etc. I am just glad I don't have young children to tow like some of the other families do. I am a fast walker and it takes me approximately 5 minutes to walk to and from my building and the main lobby. But wait, that's not all, there is more walking to be involved.To make matters worse, whoever designed -- at least my -- building, was a moron. So you get in the triangular shaped building. The elevators are on the far end of the building, not near the entrance like you'd hope. You enter and either walk straight to the center of the building through this humongous garden at the ground level towards the water fountain. Then they force you through a path to walk a perfect half circle around the water fountain (you choose to go left or right) then merge again to walk straight towards the end of the building. But that's not it, you can't get to the elevator yet. You have to then walk towards the corners of the building (again, you can choose to go left of right), THEN you can walk towards the elevators that are in the center of the far end of the building. It's DUMB DUMB DUMB. I just end up walking to gravel, sometimes almost tripping myself because they are quite wobbly, especially when I'm carrying so many things with me.As if that wasn't enough walking, then there is more walking to your car. Valet parking is $22 but they are slow slow slow. You cannot call ahead from your room. So you have to go through what I just described, then 20 minutes later arrive at the lobby to ask the valet to retrieve your car. So if you're lucky you could be out within 30 minutes. But if you want to self-park, it's $17, and there is more walking, at least 5 minutes. There is a beach parking across the street but the gates close at 8 PM and open at 7 AM, so you have to make sure you come back before 8 PM and leave no earlier than 7 AM. We go to bed early and leave at 7 AM every morning so that works out for us.Make sure you have EVERYTHING you need before you leave your room. We made the mistake of getting to the lobby and forgetting something. I told my son to run back to the room while I go get the car from the parking lot, and I would pick him up at the front lobby. We met 20 minutes later. Imagine if you were at your car then realized you forgot something in your room, it would take you at least 30 minutes to go back to your room and back out to the car again. One time we forgot something while we were already on the road, and we just decided to go to the store and buy new instead of spending the time and dealing with the ordeal of trying to go back to our room. Seriously, going to a hotel room while on vacation should not be that difficult.3. Room qualityWe stayed at the Palace Tower. Apparently that's not the most expensive room, but still I'd expect a high quality space. Wallpaper peeled off everywhere. Black mold in the bathroom. We have a king size bed (remember I said whoever designed the hotel was a moron) and the bed is placed diagonally in the room, reducing the space available and narrowing the space available to walk between the bed and the TV. I don't get it. It's an awkward layout that so does not improve the aesthetic of the room. Whoever designed the hotel must have think \"Oh let's create a huge garden and force everyone to walk around and around in a maze every time they come in and go, and let's do something creatively dumb in the room layout\".4. ServiceSaved the best for last. I had the modem making a loud buzzing noise at 4 AM, waking me up while on my vacation. I called the concierge, got no sympathy at all, as if I was just calling to ask about the weather. Then the next day I was offered to move rooms, so I asked if I would get any compensation for the inconvenience. Moving rooms would mean packing and unpacking, and would take me at least 1.5 hour, ruining all my plans for the day. Oh and they wanted me to go to the concierge to pick up the key to the new room (remember what an adventure getting to the main lobby is?) which I said no way I would walk all the way to the concierge. Anyway, I asked if I would get anything for the inconvenience if I had to move rooms. The response I got was \"No ma'am, we are giving you the best accommodation available\". I was furious and said \"You guys are not doing me a favor, you are supposed to be trying to fix a mistake, so don't tell me you're giving me the best accommodation available.\"One more thing, don't bother asking the valet any area information. There is a beach next to the resort, Anaehoomalu beach, which the Big Island Revealed travel book describes as being connected to the resort by a walkable trail. So I asked the valet about that, and he gave me a confused look as if I was asking if it was possible to swim to Japan from the resort. I said, my guide book says there is a beach nearby. He says, yeah but you'd have to jump over rocks. Idiot. We found the trail, and it was an easy and fun trail to walk, only 10 minutes away to the beach.Lessons learned:1. Do not stay in Waikoloa on the Big Island. Stay in Kona instead.2. Do not stay in big resorts when visiting Hawaii, especially not this one. Renting condos would be much better: cheaper, more convenient, parking is included, and you can cook and do laundry. I usually rent condos but this time wanted to try a resort thinking it might be more convenient having someone clean the room everyday. I'd rather make my own bed and be able to walk straight from my front door to my car. ", " What a frustrating resort and a total waste of my precious vacation time! First of all, there is no parking in front of your building. To make it worse, it is $17/day to park there or $22/day for valet parking. They say the monorail runs every 15 minutes, but if you miss it, you have to double that for it to come back. To go somewhere just done the road (less than a mile) we had to leave our room 45 minutes ahead of time just to make sure we would be one time. We were not only at the furthest tower, the Ocean, but we were also dead center of the circular tower making it the farthest walk to our room once we got off the elevator. If we walked fast, we could make it back to the lobby in under 10 minutes. This is okay if you are not dragging luggage or carrying groceries/purchases. If you forgot something in your room, too bad. There was no way I was going to waste another 30-40 minutes of my vacation to go retrieve the hat I realized I had forgotten once we got to the lobby. I am a beach person, so I cannot critique the swimming pools, one of which was closed. We did, however, try out the lagoon on our very first day. The water was cloudy and disgusting. You could see a film of sunscreen oil floating on top. When snorkeling, the water was blurry on the top 12 inches. All I could think of was getting out and taking a shower! They really need to urge people either personally or with signs, to NOT enter the water until 20 minutes after applying sunscreen. Not only is it bad for the water, but for the marine life as well.As for the room, it was loud. The path to get to our room was brick, making all the carts being pushed quickly down the path sound like thunder. Did not appreciate the 7:30 AM or 10:45 PM cart races. Then there were the Myna birds. I felt like I was in a Hitchcock movie. They didn\u2019t not chirp all night long, but they would continue their gatherings throughout the night without warning. The water in the shower was very inconsistent going from cold to almost scalding. I had to put a towel in the shower to stand on so I wouldn\u2019t slip when running from the hot water. (There were no tub matts to stand on). I was shocked that there was no microwave provided. There was a mini refrigerator, however, which came stocked with leftover food from the prior guests. The only place to charge your phone was either in the bathroom or at the desk. NOTE: if you charge at the desk, be sure to turn off the desk lamp via the lamp and not the light switch when you enter the room as this will cut your power off. The bed had a big, scratched up, wooden headboard that had the alarm and light cords hidden within, so there was no way to conveniently charge your phone right by the bed. The bed was too soft as were the pillows. I had to roll my pillow up to get neck support. I felt every time my husband moved on the bed. The lanai consisted of 2 chairs and a lava bed just outside the railing that had no plants although it had a watering spout. Spider webs with large spiders had made their home there making it an undesirable place to be.We never ate at the resort except for the luau. The food was mediocre and the show was too touristy and corny at times. Not the traditional large, local men that I was used to. A lot of the dancers were young. I felt like I was watching a group of kids performing at a 6 flags show. I\u2019m happy we didn\u2019t pay for it (we did a timeshare tour) cause it is too over-priced at $109 for general admission and $135 (I believe) for the \u201cAlii\u201d front row tables. Fish was dry, pork disappointing and desserts just okay. This is an insane price to pay for a meal, anywhere! The pictures they took cost $42 which we did not buy.In conclusion, I would say staying at this resort is a total waste of my time. My vacation time is too precious to waste an hour of my time commuting back and forth to my room. We made sure when we left the room we didn\u2019t return until we were done for the day. I would not recommend this resort to anyone! But I strongly urge anyone with disabilities or pain when walking for long periods of time, to RUN from this resort! Even if you are the type of person who wants to just stay at the resort, I honestly can\u2019t see why you would choose this one. There is no convenience in anything at this resort. The engineer who designed this should be fired! ", " Where is the Aloha in Hawaii when you reach your hotel and have to pay for parking to stay there. Really north Kona Hotels how can you possibly justify paid parking for hotel guest and other visitors? With your already outrageous prices.Or expect anyone to visit or stay in your property when they are greeted by pay parking stations with no posted fee signs until you reach the valet desk.And then it's posted on the ground,for the people who only look down. $17.00 a day for registered guest. 3.00$ an hour for others. Yes you can get a validation after eating or drinking in venues.But how would anyone know as it's NOT posted at entrance. And No one wants to pay for parking to stay in their already expensive hotel. When I called the executive office to say how offensive this pay parking is, with no signS. I was told it's because locals park there and have friends drive them to airport so they don't have to pay airport parking.BEYOND rediculous excuse. With $17.00 fee for registered guest. By the way no one greets your guest or visitors with the word Aloha! Not the valet,concierge, front desk, or housekeepers.however you hear many other languages used by your employees.For people who can't do the walk thru expensive property you are running only one tram or boat . So they are forced to spend their time waiting at stations for long periods of time when they could be at outlets spending money. Overall picture,over kill with parking fees!!!Really bad idea for gouging people and in very bad taste. No wonder occupancy is so low! No full service. No ALOHA!!!!! If you need someone to explain what that is Debi I'm available! Won't suggest family and friends stay there or visit in future. Obviously your not interested in locals staying there either. It use to be the splurge locals made. Empty hotel better then local business. You might attract some tourist from surrounding condos, if they weren't stop at pay for parking no posted fees! Wake up and find your ALOHA!!!!!! It's FREE!!!! ", " This hotel was one of the bigger disappointments in years of travel. The room we requested (two beds) had been guaranteed by phone and email. The Front desk at check-in had never been notified of our request or confirmation so they tried to put us in a king bed room impossible with my wire's handicap. The then put us in a room with two beds and a wet rug. Finally, they got us into a room that other than the dirty carpet was dry and had two beds.There is no warning, if you are handicapped that the rooms are very far from the lobby and even after traveling to the last stop on the train, the walk to our room had my wife in tears.Service in the restaurant was unbelievable, I ordered a beer and after watching it sit on the bar for literally over 5 minutes, I walked over to our waitress and asked if the beer was warm enough yet to serve. All she would say was that a prior guest had stiffed her by walking out without paying (I think I understand why but that was wrong!).Last comment - never again - makes me wonder about what is happening to Hilton in general. ", " Back on Nov 18, 2013 we decided to check out the Hilton Waikoloa Village for a possible future stay. We drove to valet parking and read the sign stating $3/hour. We told the valet, Sheldon, that we would only be an hour or less. Less than 1 hr later we returned and submitted our ticket to the cashier. She said, \"that will be $22\". Initially we thought she had read it incorrectly so she rechecked it and said, \"no, you owe $22\". We pointed to the 1st and 2nd lines on the Parking Rates sign directly in front of the cashier. It read: Each hour $3. Daily Maximum $17. She claimed that was for the Self Parking rates. We challenged her and said that is NOT what the sign reads. At that point she called over Sheldon. She seemed perturbed with him and we got the feeling this was not the first complaint. We reminded Sheldon we originally told him we would only be there for an hour or less. Sheldon argued with us and pointed to the bottom portion of the sign. It read: Registered Hotel Guests (per day)Self Parking $17Valet Parking $22We said we are NOT registered guests and that the top portion of the sign should apply. The top portion does not specify Self Parking and seriously, we are standing in the Valet Parking area, not the Self Parking area anyway. Even one of the other valets asked the cashier to just charge us $3 but apparently that seemed impossible to the cashier. The nice valet (sorry didn't get his name) apologized and seemed to acknowledge we had a legitimate complaint.If the Hilton staff reads this, please also be aware that we toured 2 other high end hotels on the island that week and used their valet parking for less than one hour each. Their charge: Gratuity Only (definitely NOT $22/hr!) ", " This hotel is not a four or five star hotel. The service is terrible. We find the walk to the rooms are ridiculous. The front desk does not explain it was easier to walk to our rooms verses catching the tram. Once we got off the tram, we had to walk three times the distance to our room. Also, the tram conductor shuts the door right on us. She just laughs at us. I prefer catching the Wiki Wiki bus at the Honolulu airport then having a robotic tram conductor that does not care. The management should consider having the tram not to be on a automatic timing schedule basis since the tram is empty. The luggage to our rooms took over ONE HOUR and twenty minutes. They are super slow. We cannot reach the operators, perhaps we called when they changed shifts but this is still unheard of. They need more staff members at their hotel. You can get more value out of your dollars elsewhere. This hotel is too large and is very impersonal. If you want the true aloha spirit, you should go elsewhere. ", " Upon arrival, we used the bell captain service to deliver our baggage from the valet parking lot. It took them 1.5 hours to deliver our bags to our room. The bell captain desk manager made excuses and said they were very busy and I have to just understand that. He never apologized. One of the staff members from the bell captain staff finally delivered our bags and said they were very slow and could of delivered our bags in 15 minutes. He said our cart with luggage was just lying around. He then said the front desk staff forgot to notify them and that is why our luggage was not delivered quickly. No one owns up to the problem, they do not teamwork and just lie.I was told that the front desk manager would call me. We never received a courtesy phone call.The staff does not teamwork well together. On top of that when I tried to call the front desk at 8:00 am. no one answers the phone. It rang 20 times and I tried calling twice. We do not plan to return to this resort. The general manager needs to stay on top of things better. This hotel used to be packed and the grounds were more beautiful. The best part of our visit was having breakfast at the buffet restaurant. The hostess and our server provided excellent service. ", " I was in Waikoloa for a week long family vacation that we had been planning to take for a very long time. We had a condo and I flew over two days early to make sure all of our reservations were in order and to set-up our scuba diving, etc. So for the two days that I was there by myself I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I travel a lot for my job and therefore have been a Hilton Diamond member since 2000. I stay almost exclusively at Hilton chains. With that in mind I was expected a very nice room and an upgrade above what I had paid for. In two days I had to change rooms three times! First and second rooms were in the Ocean View Tower. I had paid for an Ocean View already and was expecting an upgrade to a small suite or something very nice. But my first room had only a partial ocean view and was very dated, in need of much renovation. So I complained and they moved me to another room in the same building. This room had a GREAT ocean view (what I had previously paid for) but there were hundreds of tiny ants around the night stands and throughout the bathroom. Not good. So I complained once again. This time they agreed to move me to the Dolphin/Lagoon Building. Before I go on please keep in mind that this is a VERY LARGE complex and getting from a building at one end of the resort to a building at the opposite end of the resort is no easy task, especially with any luggage. So I arrived in my new room in the new building. Room was quite nice, had an obstructed ocean view, but was newly renovated. But it was not clean. My bathroom looked as though it had barely been wiped down. Sink handles were dirty (had to clean them myself). Sticky stuff on desk and night stand as well. But at this point I just wanted to sleep. The only reason they moved me to the \"NEW\" building was because I went down to the lobby to check out and go to another hotel. They stopped me and put me here (where I should have been placed in the beginning). But this took until 11pm to get the room! Then that night I had people checking into the room above me at 2am with screaming kids jumping on and off the beds! What a nightmare! Why would any parent allow their children to do this? It only teaches them to behave badly. Then the adjoining room next to me had babies crying at 3am, then 4am, then 5am. I realize that the baby can't help it. But why would the hotel put me next to them if they knew my request was for peace and quite? I'm up at this point, but with no sleep. So I asked to be moved once again. This time they finally put me in a corner room that was quite. So I did get one good nights sleep, just in time to check out! They have a tram and a boat that will transport you from place to place within the complex. But it only runs every 20 minutes or so, much too long to sit and wait when you have a limited amount of time on vacation. Needless to say, I will NEVER go back to that Hilton again. I won't let my family or friends go there either. If you want to experience Hawaii then I suggest renting a house or condo. You will save money, get more sleep and peace and quiet, yet still be able to go to all the sights and can do so without walking three miles to get to your car. You can still go there to do Dolphin Quest (which we did). It is the only thing worth while. ", " If you don't plan to leave the hotel the entire time, don't mind spending lots on overpriced mediocre food, don't care that there isn't access to a natural sandy beach of Big Island, but do care to stay in a nice hotel with nice amenities, nice view, friendly staff, then this hotel is for you. The hotel is about 30 minutes from Kailua-Kona airport so that's not terrible. It's about $55 one-way transportation for the 2 of us. Hotel has pools, quite a few restaurants and bars, good view, not terribly far from civilization like Waimea. They do have luau so that was convenient. And the show is pretty good. I have nothing to compare to, but I was entertained.Now I'll talk about why I say it's \"POOR\" for me. 1. It has no access to natural sandy beach. It has a man-made cove / sandy area that is hotel property so it's only for hotel guests. But I'd much rather stay in a hotel that has direct access to a natural beach like Mauna Kea or Sheraton. Something is better than nothing. You could go to other public beaches but you'll see why it's inconvenient from this hotel later...2. Everything is expensive and boring. Breakfast buffet is $30. I made a mistake of ordering coffee before an a la carte meal, the coffee was $6. A simple meal would have been $14, and at this point I might as well order buffet. And I did. But the buffet selection is also limited. Doesn't even taste all that better. A total waste of money. Then we tried a \"steak\" restaurant, ergh... so so. And don't expect to find Kona beef. They get it from the mainland. I don't know if Kona beef is better but I want to try local food! Oh, and that was like $50 a person with a glass of wine... Totally get on trip advisor and find yourself some local cuisine outside of the resort. Drive to Waimea. Drive to Kona. Try the local cuisine; it's much better.3. This is the worst part.. The resort is pretty huge and you have to lave your car outside of it. You can either valet and tip every time you get your car or you can spend forever time to get to your car. So you can't drive in the resort. If you get a room in Ocean Tower, which is at the far end, good luck. You can do a 10 - 15 minute walk (one-way) or you can take a tram. A tram that shows up every 15 to 20 minutes. And the tram is super slow. I think we spend at least 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours everyday just waiting on the tram. Sometimes we just walk. They also have boats, which is even slower and less frequent than the tram. The 2nd night we were there, we went to get a case of bottled water and beer. Got back to the lobby to find out the tram was down that night. So we had to carry a a 24-bottle case of water and beer over at least a mile walk back to the room. Seriously, my time can be better spent on other things.4. The birds go crazy around 4am Hawaii time. And I mean they really really go crazy. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.In summary, hotel is not bad. It's what you would expect from a Hilton. But unless you plan to stay here and don't mind the inconvenience, it'll probably work for you. But if you're like me and rather spend the time and $$ on things that matter (experiencing Big Island and its culture), STAY AWAY! ", " My wife and I stayed here for 8 nights in August. I was there for a work conference. After having a long day of travel check in went pretty well for large resort. We took the monorail out to The Ocean Tower. Just for reference it is a half a mile walk from the front desk to the ocean tower where we stayed. The room was nice, a little older, it could use an upgrade. But still the room was very large for a standard room and very nice. We were unsatisfied with a few things and made a call to the front desk. Mainly the planter next to the balcony was bare and it looked like it had exposed wires in it. Also our water glasses where completely filthy. So I called the front desk and asked to be moved and nothing could be done.We went on with our evening and called it a night just exhausted from a long day. The next morning we wake up and upon a little further inspection find stains on the bed sheets. At this point we were just fed up it all. I took the half mile walk to the front desk and explained what had happened. There was a nice girl at the front desk that was happy to move our room just a few doors down.So we packed up our stuff and headed to the new room. After unpacking we headed to the pool for the day. We arrived back at the room to get ready for dinner; I went outside to hang our bathing suites out to dry and discovered a pair of women\u2019s panties hanging from one of the balcony chairs. At this point I was fit to be tied. I called the front desk to explain what had happen and I spoke with a gentleman who was completely aphetic to my concerns.who said they were sending up a house keeping supervisor. 10 minutes later a house keeper came to remove the used panties. She was not a supervisor and just directed us back to the front desk.At this point we went to the front desk and I explained the whole situation. The front desk person literary said what would you like me to do? I told him that my wife would not say in that room. Due to what we found she was concerned of what else was missed in the room. When relaying to the gentleman what we had experienced he chuckled about the panty issue. Not once was there any concern that moving rooms three times in 24 hours. It was almost like he was doing us a favor for moving us. I had to tell him that we would not sleep in that room. It was almost like the front desk staff did not feel that our experience was a big deal.I am sure he was just doing what he was trained to do. This has been very trying and nothing was done to truly rectify the situation. We were given the new room begrudgingly and there was not one apology. We are staying at the hotel for 8 nights and at this point our experience has not been great.That evening after dinner I was still upset about the whole situation and I emailed the hotel manager Debi Bishop. I explain to her exactly what we had experience. The following day I received a call from the action Manager asking me if she could send up and amenity to apologize for the troubles. I asked her if she read the email. She said no and that she only saw the pictures. I began to explain the whole story to her and she asked me what she could do to help. At this point I wanted an upgrade of some sort. She said that she could not give me an upgrade but she ended up giving us a couple massage at the spa.I know that the acting manager did what was in her power but it really felt like they could care less about my experience. We had to pack and unpack 3 times in 36 hours because of bad housekeeping. It seems as if there really is not any customer service at this hotel. They have you there, it\u2019s a small island and you have to deal with whatever is thrown at you. It is a beautiful resort and it would have been much better if we had better service. I will not go back to this resort and we are planning on going back to Kona in the near future. ", " Very, very, disappointing at the Hilton. We stayed here for 3 days out of our 6wk summer vacation. We first checked in a little early which was fine and they said that our room was not ready yet but that we could check our bags in and they would call us when our room was available. After dropping off our bags we proceeded to the pool that was the closest to the Palace Tower (where they first told us our room was at). Our kids played and we enjoyed the sun. Around 2:00 we received a call telling us that our room was ready and to go to the Palace Tower and to get our room number. We decided that this was a perfect time to drop our things off in the room and then go get something to eat. When we arrival at the Palace Tower the front desk receptionist gave us our room number (4332) and wrote it down and told us how to get there. We proceed up to the 4th floor, bags and kids in tow and was unable to find our room. We then asked a house keeper and he informed us that we were in the wrong tower.. At this point the kids were getting fussy and tired. We proceed to the first desk and ask the same person where our room was and she told us that room 4332 was in the Lagoon Tower (I was a little mad now because she first told us that it was here in the Palace Tower). Once again we get on the train to the other side of the resort, to the Lagoon Tower room 4332. At the Lagoon Tower we ask the first desk where to find room 4332, she told that we where in the right Tower and to proceed to the 4th floor and that our keys where already working. We again go to find our room (Kids and bags in tow). We get to our room and the key cards do NOT work. At this point the kids lost it and I myself did too. We went back down to the first desk of the Lagoon Tower and the customer service rep said that she would send someone from security to get our key cards to work. Back up to our room, the security asked for our ID to verify that this is our room and he informed us that this room was NOT assigned to us. Us being very confused showed him the room number that was given to us by the customer service rep at the Palace Tower. At this time we decided to leave (kids and bags in tow) and head to the main desk, back on the train again. Once at the Main check-in we asked to speak to the manager and it turned out that our room was in the Palace Tower and was room 4232 NOT 4332, so it was back on the train back to the Palace Tower. At this point it was close to 5:00 and we still have not had a bite to eat. Once in the room we dropped off the bags and left to get back on the train to get the kids something to eat. The manager did extend his apologies and paid for our dinner which was greatly appreciated. At this point I thought the disappointment was over and we could start to enjoy our stay here. I was completely WRONG! After dinner we took the train back to our room and started to get settled in. The kids started looking for outlets to charge their Ipads and my youngest found one next to the A/C vent. He needed a little help plugging it in and when I went to help him I couldn't help but notice the A/C vent was covered in dust (it wasn't just a little bit, it was dark and thick). I immediately had him move away and turned off the A/C so it was not blow all that dust in the room. I couldn't believe it so I took pictures of this and called my sis and brother and sent them the photos and asked them if I was being too anal. Both of the them agreed that I was not and to call the first desk and demand that someone come clean it which is what I did. 45mins later someone come and changed the filter, vacuumed the vent out, and left. By this point it was 9:30pm and I was done. The maintenance engineer asked when we would be out of the room tomorrow because he wanted to do some more cleaning. I told him that we would be out by 8am for him to do this. The next day I didn't hear from anyone regarding this and decide that the hotel manager needed to see the photos of the vent. All he said was that he was sorry.Will we stay here again? NO! Will I tell my friends and family? YES!! Will I show them the photos? YES! For a Hilton this place was very disappointing for the price!! ", " Recently stayed at this property and was extremely disappointed. This was our third and final stop on what was, to that point, a delightful trip to Hawaii. Upon arrival were we're herded like cattle, and waited to check in. This was a slow time of year, so said a manager later on, so it made no sense for the long check in, except they were understaffed. No warm Hawaii greeting from any staff. Given totally wrong information at check in about the resort. Took almost an hour to get our bags. No apology. Couldn't connect to wifi..no apology. Concierge was not around to assist with dining options. Manager on duty had few menus outside of the few very overpriced choices in the hotel. There were almost no choices to eat out outside of the hotel. And to make matters worse, our Lagoon Tower room, which was recently renovated,,had mold in the shower. Management didn't seem to care. You are a number at this place, like cattle. Do yourself a favor and stay closer to Kona, where all the restaurants and shops are. This place was the pits. ", " Maybe it was because I had such a high expectation of an expensive hotel on the big island but we really were not impressed. My husband and I went here for the first three days of our honeymoon.Upon check-in, the lady RANADA was unimpressionable. She asked if we were honeymooners because we couldnt stop the googlie eye stuff. We said yes and her response was something to the effect of \"that's nice.\" They did not upgrade us at all Now for the rude manager RYAN [--] we agree with earlier complainants we were treated like an inconvenience was rude to us and unhelpful. He insisted that people usually pay for upgrade to lagoon tower.(even though were Diamond Hilton because we stay there ALL the time). Even with the loyalty of 20 years.... that was a dissappointment. I assume they get honeymooners all the time and it just isnt a big thing for them to see or care about.... but I was still slightly shocked. They did, however, deliver a bottle of a dry champagne which was a nice touch.The room was nothing better than a Motel 6 as far as I was concerned. The decor had to at least be 20 years old, there wasnt a fan in the small bathroom, the tub was standard. The view was decent. We overlooked the golf course and the ocean.All the other reviewers said that same about the great resort.... it is a gorgeous resort! The restaurants are ridiculously expensive for mediocre food. Frozen drinks are delicious but for $10-13 for a small drink.... they are not good enough. I know that it is a resort but it is a little silly. ", " This hotel is old and the smell in the rooms are awful. We plan to stay there as a family for 5 nights, Wwe had to move to a different hotel after checking in. All rooms they suggested us had a damp smell. unpleasant experience. ", " Just checked in and did not have my room in the right tower, valet was rude when I asked about getting bags to room and then the room they did put me in doesn't even look at the water. Okay, stuff can happen, but as a Hilton Diamond Honors member they can't even find me a freaking room that looks at water at an ocean front resort surrounded by water?? Seriously? Plus the desk clerk told me to get off the train at the first stop, which wasn't even my tower. Guess she showed me! The only decent thing was Sheldon, the head valet guy who held my car for me when I had to dump my bags and go back to the airport to get my wife and daughters. Will post tomorrow and see if it still stinks! Going to ask the General Manager Sherri Bishop why they would treat a Diamond member this way. Maybe at a resort, customer loyalty is not really considered something of value. ", " Terrible place to stay. Been here 6 days. You walk and walk to get to the good pool and an epic walk to get to your car. 30 minutes to get from room to car if u take the slower then walking tram. Boat is always full. If you want to go over to the shops for some good food or to look around you have to waste 1 HOUR of your vacation day going to and from your car. You forget something in your car? Another hour wasted. Want to go get someone at the airport? It is an hour round trip drive. Plus another hour round trip from your room to the car. To get to the beach you need to move to the Marriott which is what I am doing tomorrow. Marriot is $50 cheaper plus does not charge $17 to park. Food is so so and overpriced.Lagoon is Murkey and cold. Why come to Hawaii to snorkel in a giant mud puddle? ", " The tram kept breaking down and the lobby is a three block walk back. Tram is slow. The whole place is overrun with young screaming children. They do not run the boats very often and want everyone to take the non working tram. With a mix of young and elderly family. This is not for couples. Everything is super pricy. ", " THERE IS NO BEACH at this hotel!! That was shocking! Why book a vacation in Hawaii at a RESORT with no beach? Sure, you can take a shuttle to a nearby beach or drive your car, but, most disappointing were the HOURS of vacation time required to hike from the room to the lobby to the parking lot - all of which took an average of 30 minutes one way. (There is only one entrance/exit for over 1200 rooms!) There are no carts that may be used to carry luggage and other gear to your room. You either haul it like an ox or make multiple trips. Of course, you could ride a tram or boat, but that might add another 30 minutes, especially if you just missed your ride. The boat passed us twice as we waited, and the \"captain\" shouted, \"Sorry, we're full.\" We chose to pay $17/day for parking after watching the lines of people waiting for the valets to bring their cars. I'm sure we were out of there way faster, in spite of the additional long walk to the parking lot. The night we arrived, the lot was full and cars were parked in the walkways and in the middle of the road, blocking other cars in. Staff said there had been an employee event and many of them had stayed over longer. There was a long wait to check in (only one staff member on duty). The property was beautiful, but unless you want to spend your vacation at something like Disney World, with hundreds of kids screaming everywhere you go, then STAY AWAY from the Hilton. Parents seemed to think since they are on vacation, there is no need to discipline unruly children. I watched one child run in circles around the lobby screaming at the top of his voice (with joy), but as the parents and staff watched, no one made a move to ask him to be considerate of other guests.Two other children stood on a sofa pulling on the tropical flower arrangement and bending and pinching the leaves and flower petals, but again, no intervention. It would have been quite appropriate for staff to gently approach the parents (or children) and ask politely for them to be respectful of others and their property. I suppose if you're the kind of person who prefers to relax (and stay) at a resort, this might be OK, but we actually spent very little time here, as we were interested in seeing as much of the island as possible during our week stay. We ate at Kirin, the Chinese restaurant, and the food was very good, as was the service. It was quite expensive. The drinks at all of the bars were all over $10 each, which is probably about what to expect these days. However, they weren't very good. ", " Well where do I begin. When you drive up to the lobby this hotel seems like it is going to be an incredible experience but how quickly things can change!!! This place is the most over the top obnoxious hotel I have ever started in. I am a huge fan of the Hilton and I have stayed at dozens around the world, this is the worst. The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful, the service is absolute rubbish and it is almost impossible to find anything. The hotel is way too large it is like a small city with none of the advantages. The pool staff were extremely rude and we paid over $30 for a glass of wine and a cocktail and they were both terrible!!! There are way too many kids here and even if you have kids as I do they are extremely irritating. The decor is very outdated and the whole place needs a facelift. It is expensive and extremely overrated. One positive was the food in the restaurants was very good however the service was an abomination so that didn't make too much of an impression. Overall terrible hotel on all fronts do yourself a favour save the $500 a night and go stay at the Kings Club or the Hilton Grand Vacation Club as they are both fabulous!!!! ", " Very disappointed. Service and attitude of employees was terrible. No one offered to help with luggage or directions of locating room on the complex. Breakfast was average. No Beach access and everything is overpriced (you even have to rent a lounge chair!). Found so much more service from other resorts in the area with better quality service, rooms, and food. If you want to attend a DisneyLand type facility this is as close as it gets with a lot of pools for the kids, but if you want to relax on the beach on your Hawaiian get away with hotel service, search one of the other local beachside resorts. You'll get much more for you money and be able to relax. Finally, if you have a family emergency and have no choice to check out early, forget getting a refund or voucher for a later stay. I was transferred to some person in India and told it would never happen. Thoroughly disappointed with Hilton after reading such good reviews. ", " Its more like a theme park minus the fun, were by the end you are tired from walking. It took me 30 mins from the car park to my room / room to car park every time. Plus i had to pay $17/day +taxes for car parking and an additional $25/day + taxes for resort fees for amenities i didn't use. No bottled water in the room as well. Everything in resort to room service is not worth the money. ", " Included all of the fee's when we booked the room, it was an unpleasant surprise to find out that we had to pay an addition $25 a night, for amenities that we did not use and poor internet service. We were not told that parking was an addition $17 per day on top of the $25 fee we were already being charged. Those things should be listed in the price when you book the hotel room. We got tricked into attending a time share presentation, it was a HUGE waste of time, not informative at all and seem as though they were not being honest and had been hiding the \"fine\" print. We had a terrible experience at the Chinese Restaurant, it was extremely overpriced for the size and quality of the dishes, we did not eat on the resort after our experience the first night. We looked at the menu for the Japanese Restaurant but instead ate down the road, where the selection was much greater and the prices were more reasonable. ", " The trouble starts at the hotel's Web site, where misrepresents its coastal location and water facilities. The front desk personnel are incompetent and Hilton Honors VIPs do not get any recognition and any complaints are treated with contempt or ignorance. Typical response: \"There is nothing we can do about it.\" Expect price gouging, even for Hawaii standards. There are many other options on the Big Island and you should seriously consider everyone but Hilton Waikoloa. Stay here at your own risk. ", " The rooms are worn with chips in the furniture, and frayed carpet. The rooms are at least a half mile from the self park, valet was rude, and the tram goes slower than walking speed. Do yourself a favor and rent a condo for over half the price. All the beaches in Hawaii are public property, so even the exclusive resorts like the Four Seasons are open to the public, so simply use the beach there. ", " Hotel is deeply standards of Hilton worlwide. Room was old (worn with use) and musty smell. Mould in bathroom.Mandatory resort fees 25USD/ngt - local calls and internet included but we didn't need anything, 17USD/ngt per car on self-parking.We were disappointed with hotel quality and its location. 6 miles from Waikoloa, without car you are not able to go anywhere. Rooms are old and need reconstruction. There is musty smell on rooms. Everything is chargeable despite of mandatory daily fee. Maybe good for families with children but not for couples. We got room with two beds instead of one king bed. We requested for change of room but without success. So room was not great for couple. ", " The rooms were only ok. The pool was nice, kids loved it. BUT - by 4pm the bathrooms near the pool became gross. No toilet paper left in any stall, paper and standing water on the floor. So disgusting, and it happened every day. Like no one went and cleaned them mid-day.The water in the spa near the pool with the big slide was yellow. It was so old and dirty. Won't ever stay there. ", " Very disappointed I have stayed here 3 times each time the property is going down hill. There are to many other resorts better prices and facilities I should have paid attention to the reviews. Food at the restraints was below average. ", " Walked in through the doors of the hotel, and the door greeter asked \"Are you sure you are at the right hotel?\" Found out that I need to pay $17 for parking and $25 mandatory internet charge. I told them that I did not need it, but they forced me to take it anyway.There is no place to eat dinner late, and I have a meal that I need to microwave, but none can be found. I called Dominos and they are not allowed to deliver there. They force us to buy their crappy over priced food. So I walked over to one of their restaurants, which was closed. As I was walking back, I saw these grown men running through the hallways spouting racial slurs to me, and one almost ran me over. His response was, \"You'll get over it.\"I paid almost $300 to starve and be racially attacked. Again, worst place to stay in on the Big Island. I would never want to stay here ever again. ", " We were so disappointed: It was very old and run down furnishings in the rooms. It is very overpriced and not the place that you want to go if you are in vacation mode:: So spread out, and the walls are thin: we could hear the infant crying every night waking up our family, then when we asked to move rooms: they never followed up and we never got moved. Needless to say, it was a sleepless week for us. The spa was dirty, and you felt rushed, OVERPRICED as well.Sad experience from Oahu ", " I got married at the Hilton Waikoloa on October 27th. This was the day a tsunami warning was issued. I completely understand that natural disasters can and do happen, but the way the Hilton mismanaged the situation was abhorrent. I was in the middle of dancing with my father when an unidentified woman took the microphone from the DJ, delivered a terrifying message that an earthquake had occurred in Canada and a tsunami was heading towards Hawaii and we needed to get to higher ground. Then she left without instructions and before anyone could ask her any questions. Because of her odd delivery and out of the blue appearance we honestly thought it was a joke. But minutes later our service staff left as well. This struck immediate fear and panic into everyone present. 90% of us were from the mainland and not used to tsunami warnings. No one told us were to go or what to do. We had no idea when this was supposed to happen. No one told us the wedding was over. The Hilton Waikoloa Staff abandoned almost 60 guests at a wedding to save themselves. No evacuation plan shared, no directions to the lobby, no instructions on what to do if you are not a guest at the hotel - could they go back into Kona? Would they be able to get back to their hotels? No timeline of when the tsunami was supposed to come. NOTHING. There were people frantically trying to find exits and wandering around confused. Those who could not get rooms on higher levels were told to hang out in the hallways. As you can imagine it was a very scary and stressful situation. Most of my guests scattered and left. The older ones who needed help and those with infants stayed behind and decided to try to get a room for the night. Upon doing so the front desk agents asked them if they wanted an OCEAN VIEW (isn't there a tsunami coming?) and they were charged varying rates.My husband and I stayed at the hotel the next day. Not one person contacted us to see if we were OK or to apologize for the half wedding we had experienced. I had to reach out to our catering manager and the general manager. It was like trying to get into the Oval Office. Pretty impossible. When we finally spoke with the management team they were cavalier and trivialized our experience. They kept referring to all the other perfect weddings they have had in the past. - SO WHAT?? The Hilton said they would refund us for the things we didn't get. (DUH) Then they offered us a Dolphin Slumber Party - hotel stay, dinner and a dolphin experience. Give me a break. That is supposed to make up for my terrifying wedding night and having a reception that was missing the cake cutting, dessert, dancing, and talking to our guests? I would NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to anyone. They are the antithesis of hospitality, customer service and safety. On a smaller note: *Our minister (who the Hilton hired) was over a half an hour late and made no apology.*Because we didn't cut our cake we were told they saved it. It was given back to us in several boxes.*The pools are FREEZING and unheated. *It takes 15-20 minutes to get from the lobby to your room, and another 15-20 minutes to walk to your car. *The front desk is severely understaffed *The KPC Restaurant has super friendly staff and the manager is fantastic. *The Spa is nice *It's super commercialized and not the Real Hawaii experience one should hope for. There is no beach access anywhere nearby. ", " I guess you either love this place. Or you hate it. I was horrified. But I also saw people actually enjoying this place. So he, no hard feelings. People who love stay at theme parks will probably be happy at this hotel. Only, I had to stay there for four nights for professional reasons, and I suffered... The infantile tram and boat to the rooms, the bland to really bad food everywhere, the horrible cocktails, the plastic cups, cuttlery and smiles... Every occasion there was to flee this plastic world to real and beautiful places on the Island I was so happy and relieved. From now on I have a new vision of Hell : Limbo is having to live at the Hilton Waikoloa Village for the rest of your life... Hell is discovering you're still in Hilton Waikoloa Village after that. ", " We stayed here for one night and that was good enough for us. They've huge property (which is nice) but its pretty badly managed. Service is really bad. I'll just mention some examples of poor service:a. When we called Room service for 2 bottles of water, they delivered it 45 mins later and charged 30 bucks! Including 8$ delivery fee!! b. A/c in our room was not cooling properly so we called the maintenance and the guy changed the filter after which it was working better but I'd expect them to check this before guest checks in. c. We had to order some dinner in night (just a cheese sandwich) and it took 1.5 hrs for them to deliver the food and they were not apologetic about it either.The room was a big disappointment specially given the price they charged for it (we paid ~580$ for 1 night). I'd seriously discourage anyone who values service in a hotel. ", " I'm usually pretty easy to please but I hated this resort. The rooms are in dire need of renovations and my room smelled so musty and nasty I had to have it changed. It is so large and impersonal--you have to take a tram to get around. And finally, to add insult to injury, the breakfast buffet is $30pp-what a rip-off!! ", " Okay, this is a big place, so that could be plus or minus. It is something like a cross between a big airport and Epcot center. They have a captive audience because you are a long way from town, or even a fair priced grocery store. So the whole Waikaloa establishment banks on the hassle to leave the resort to find food or fun. It was about 20 minutes from our car to the room, with or without the monorail train ride. The food price and quality, and hotel layout is much like an airport, with multiple concourses and a train ride between each. Never found a restaurant we enjoyed and drink prices were frightening (like $9 beer or $15 margaritas).The worst part was the air conditioner made my wife very sick. I got suspicious when I realized her symptoms got better away from the room, but didn't find the source until my wife was losing her voice. I showed the front desk a picture of the mold and serious problems my wife was having. No sympathy, no offer to move us, no \"what can we do to make this right\" attitude, just a call to maintenance. This place really seemed to be all about the money and cranking the cattle through. In the spirit of full disclosure, this was not my first choice for lodging for many of the above reasons, but mainly the poor location for the sightseeing and touring we had planned. The only reason we stayed here was the discount package we were offered. Even with the discount, we paid too much and wish we had stayed closer to town. I've included a picture of the moldy mess I showed the front desk clerk. ", " Staying here now in the ocean tower. I laughed when someone told me the birds were so loud they would keep you up... Haha the jokes on me because they are louder than I could ever imagine! This hotel is terrible. The food is gross and cheap but costs an arm and a leg! Who do they think they are? The decor is creepy, cheesy and outdated. The hotel is all around crap and it's near nothing so you're trapped and forced to spend your money here. Avoid.One plus: the staff have all been very nice. ", " Millions of birds woke me up this morning at 5 AM. (Sunrise and sunset) We are currently staying in the Lagoon tower room 5353! Dont know if we can change towers or if the problem is there as well. Reading these comments I suppose the birds are going to do this for the entire stay of my vacation! Do not stay here! This is the hotel from hell!!!!! ", " This is the first negative review I have ever left for anything. This hotel was a let down. To be fair we just came from the Disney Resort - Aulani on Oahu and we had a great experience. If we we're only coming to this resort on our vacation we would probably think it's fair, but coming from a great resort we know better. The bad: Our room was in the Ocean Tower and is a very looong walk or a very loong tram ride to anything and everything. The A/C unit smells like a musty old locker room. Our kid (who can't swim on his own) was told he had to take off his flotation vest to use the water slides. That's when he should most have it on in my opinion. The bartender (Lawrence) is extremely rude. You can tell he's burnt out on tourists. Our room key stopped working after day 1 and with a sleeping kid in our arms after dinner, we were stuck outside our room. The food and drinks are more expensive than Aulani and not as good. The rooms are loud, you can hear people and carts rolling by etc.All in all not a great place. If you're looking for a great kid friendly place with top notch service, happy staff and an awesome resort pony up the few extra dollars and go to Aulani. ", " I stayed in April 2012 - so this way over due. While the grounds are lovely and there is a lot to do; would not recommend or stay there again. My first day had a massage, used hot tub + steam room in the spa. Ended up with a skin infection that required antibiotics both pills and cream. I reported this to the hotel. I was unable to go swimming etc the rest of my trip. It took several calls and a stop to the administrative offices to be able to speak with anyone. They promised they would remove the cost of the massage from my credit card. They failed to do so. The food in the restaurants is pedestrian at best. Had an ocean view that was nice, room itself was average; have stayed in better. Bed was comfortable. The customer service is not up to par with what a Hilton normally is. ", " The hotel is in a beautiful scenic location. Unfortunately, the fun is marred by the red welts and itchy skin you and your children will experience. The staff eventually admitted they have had similar complaints in the past. ", " This is a beautiful property, but between the cacophony from the mynah birds at all hours of the night and the poor customer service, we would never stay here again. \u00a0As a family of 4, we opted for the room with 2 queen beds, but this placed us in the Lagoon Tower which should be renamed Sleep Deprivation Tower. \u00a0These bird sounds are not a gentle tweet, tweet. \u00a0It is not at all pleasant or restful. Think Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\". \u00a0Not only were the birds intolerable, but there was almost no soundproofing between our room and the neighbors through the connecting door. \u00a0From my bed (and over the bird noise) I could follow whole conversations and hear every spit, throat clear, and pee taking place next door. \u00a0Bad enough if we had been on the same time schedule, but we were awake early and asleep early coming from the US and they were the opposite coming from Asia. \u00a0We asked for a room change, but they were unable to accommodate, put us on a waiting list, and we never heard back.Not only was the food overpriced (that's expected in any Hawaii resort hotel), but it was also of subpar quality. \u00a0We ate Chinese food at Kirin that was far from authentic and lacking in flavor. \u00a0Peas, cubed carrots, and corn in the fried rice? \u00a0Really? \u00a0More like 50's diner food! \u00a0Given that roughly half the hotel guests are from Asia, I can't believe they don't try harder. \u00a0The crab and corn soup was also poor. \u00a0It tasted like canned corn and old crab in a glutinous mass.Saying that, the Big Island is lovely, Kohala ziplining was fabulous, food off-site was creative and authentic, and the natural beauty was awe-inspiring. \u00a0Just don't waste your money on Hilton Waikoloa Village. \u00a0There are better choices. \u00a0Hilton is letting this one tarnish the reputation... ", " We pre-paid for 3 nights at the Hilton and checked out after 1 night, that's how much we hated it. It's just too big. It's a 62 acre compound with the pool on one end and our room at the other. Twenty minute walk each way (no joke!) or even longer if you wait for the tram. Hard to get a seat at the pool, very little shade there too. Breakfast buffet was way over priced and not good either. The Dolphin Quest looked cool, but was all booked up. We'd planned to spend the day by the lagoon but after getting off on the wrong tram stop, hiking all over, and the overwhelming number of people here, we decided our family of 4 would be happier at a smaller, quieter hotel, and moved to the Marriott. Additional random comments: the theme here is Asian, not Hawaiian. We walked out of the Chinese restaurant after finding fried rice for $26 was the cheapest thing on the menu. We had a good pizza at the Italian place downstairs, but someone here picked up my room number and name and started charging to it! 3 false charges on my bill (2 posted AS I was checking out!) this was handled very professionally (security sent to try to find the people doing it) and I wasn't charged for it, but check your bill! And then expect to stand there for 10-15 minutes if they have to research anything for you.Overall this was just too much of a complex/compound, and not enough of the laid back Hawaii feel we came to the Big Island for. So far, the Marriott is a better fit for us. ", " We received an unsolicited offer from Hilton Grand Vacations for this property. I requested a contract to see what we would receive and what our commitment was. We never received a full explanation of what our obligations were nor did we receive a full explanation of what were the obligations of the property. Our discussions with a representative as well as her supervisor indicated that we would have to pay additional fees for parking, a luau. This had never been explained before our calling. Don't get taken in by these solicitations. ", " This was our second time staying here and we will not be returning. We reserved and paid for an ocean front oceanview deluxe room and they put us in a terrible room in the lagoon tower at the very far end of the hotel. There are thousands of mynah birdsthat will wake you up at 4:00am each day. (The bartender at the Cantina bar) said the birds were so bad last year that they had to close the restaurant for 3 months. (But the birds are still there). To get to the main swimming pool and hot tubs is about a 25 minute walk. The slides and part of the pool were closed because someone \"pooped in the pool\" for 1 day. There is no security to keep out \"non-guests\". The boats were running every 35 minutes and the trams were always packed. I think the hotel is just now based on \"time-shares\" and some sort of \"point\" system. The service is terrible, our room was not cleaned, (only bed made, and coffee re-filled) but not cleaned. Lagoon water was really dirty with algae. Even our waitress at the pool talked about how terrible the japanese restaurant was and and that she will never go there again. Over all service, atmosphere and entire staff was really bad, and I am sorry that I booked this hotel for me and my husband. We will return to Kona but never stay here again. It is so over priced and not worth the money at all. I recommend staying in Kona where the prices are much more reasonable and there is much more to do!! ", " I live in waikoloa and got a room to spend the night of 4th of July, big disappointment! Our room was inside a construction sight and to walk to the pool, we literally, had to jump saws, tools and interrupt the construction workers. The beautiful pool was abandoned, nobody collecting the dirty towels, empty plastic cups all over and because of clogged drains, the chairs sit on a big puddle of iaky water. ", " We first spend a week in Maui and to finish our wedding anniversary vacation with our 4 kids, we got to the Big Island and booked 2 rooms for 3 nights in the Lagoon tower. I felt that the kids would have a great time here, but it was a huge disappointment to say the least. The management got their priorities completely wrong, they forgot that this should be all about their guests, but clearly along the way got totally off track. We had rooms on the 6th floor and carried our luggage, to find out that the elevator was out of work, so we had to walk back and the the staff got our luggage to our rooms. Then I injured my foot on the razor sharp edge of one of the stairs - please keep this in mind when you walk bare feet in this hotel. Do not assume you will relax or sleep beyond 8 am or go for an afternoon nap. This clearly is a construction site, non-stop. It is July 4th today and what is supposed to be a day of celebration is just another regular day on a construction site - sound of saws, hammers and so on. I love Hawaii and will come back to the islands but never ever again to this hotel - this is a hotel that is out of control (too big?) and got their priorities wrong - this is not what you would expect, very disappointing. I travel very intense year in and year out and have been in many hotels, this is the first time I felt I had to write a review to share my experience. ", " This was such a bad experience that I\u2019m not really sure where to begin. Breakfast seems logical\u2026 Our first morning we were very hungry so decided on the Big Island Breakfast. Big Island Mistake! Both my husband and I were ill within a couple of hours. We incorrectly attributed our discomfort to jet lag even though we both are reasonably intelligent and were familiar with how jet lag REALLY feels . Next morning, Big Island Breakfast again. Even bigger Big Island Mistake. I managed to dodge whatever nastiness was hidden in the food but my husband was even more ill than the day before. It took him three more days (all the while avoiding food at the resort) before he felt well enough to venture far from our room and then it was to head to Kona for medications! Our room was decent but in need of repairs\u2014the lampshade was nearly shredded, the safe didn\u2019t work, and the faucet in the tub felt as though it was going to fall off. The security person was kind and repaired the safe but the other items were still as we found them when we left after 7 days. Too bad we didn\u2019t learn our lesson from the breakfasts\u2026 after spending 3 hours with the Hilton Grand Vacation sales staff, I was getting shaky so we went to the nearest caf\u00e9. I ordered a corned beef Panini\u2014not only was it overpriced (but not surprisingly so) it was so tough that I could not get my teeth through the beef. The best I could do was rip off pieces and try to chew them. I finally gave up and ate the bread. Lesson finally learned! We found that the pre-packaged sandwiches from the ABC store were tastier than anything we\u2019d purchased on the resort. From that point on, we made ourselves picnic lunches from the grocery store\u2014not at all what I\u2019d expected to do on our trip to this interesting island. Good thing there was a Macaroni Grill nearby for breakfast. We had planned to try the Japanese steak house but were too fearful of a repeat of our previous experiences. I finally had the good sense to begin searching Trip Advisor for restaurant recommendations.Our \u201cdeal\u201d included a rental car for the week. Good thing as it took about 40 minutes of driving through black lava fields to get to ANYTHING! We spent a tremendous amount of time in the car. I suppose I should have done more research on where this resort is located because once we left the carefully (and beautifully) constructed grounds, there was nothing but black basalt and scruffy brush for miles and miles. My recommendation is to avoid this place and take your money elsewhere! ", " I recently stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village hotel (Jan 29 - Feb 6, 2012) and there are some of the issues that need to be addressed in my opinion at the Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island in Hawaii: Parking We stayed at the Ocean Towers, which is a very long way from the parking lot. It's at least a 15 minute walk at a very brisk pace. The trolley was NOT acceptable (see next). We could not drop items off at our room or take a quick break in our room because of the distance from the parking lot. And they charge for parking. Valet would not have helped. Unfortunately, we were late to a couple of activities and always felt rushed when trying to get to our room. This made our hotel-experience very stressful and uncomfortable. We therefore stayed away from the property. And they make you pay for parking that's so far away. Terrible. Suggestion: ask for a room close to the lobbyTrolley The trolley system is terrible. It is very slow. Did I say slow, I meant old-man slow! We heard from other guests that have stayed with you previously that the \"new\" trolley is 4 to 5 times slower than the old one. Many times we left our room and we were able to catch or pass the trolley while walking. Additionally, the trolley did not come often enough. Many times, the wait time was 15+ minutes. This is really bad when you have a 15 minute quick, pace walk or wait 15 minutes for another 15 minute trolley ride. 30 minutes to get to my room from the lobby of your hotel is unacceptable. Suggestion: figure out how to not use the trolly or boat or have to walk 15+ minutes (room close to lobby)Welcome message and UpsellsOn our first morning, we received a call at 6:30am \"welcoming\" us to the property and reminding us about our \"free\" gift.On one of our last evenings, we received a call at 10:30pm. It was a voice mail from the managers about offer to stay again, but it still rang in the room. Very distributing when trying to sleep and then seeing the flashing red light on the phone. Not a pleasant night's sleep. Suggestion: Ask front desk to NOT call before 10am or after 8pm ", " We travel a lot and specifically to Hawaii every year for a conference. We have enjoyed every Hawaiian island and hotel that we have stayed during our trips to Hawaii since 1992. I can not begin to descirbe the massive size and breath of this isolated 'compound.' It would be better as an all incluslive resort compund in the impoverished Caribbean islands, but not well suited for Hawaii. This ginormous resort does a tremedous disservice to the beauty and activites on this island as it is so difficult to get anywhere - within the resort as well as the geographic location of the resort.It was a 25 minute walk from our room in the Ocean Tower to the massive parking lot which charges $15 per night to boot. The monorail was SOOOO SLOW, waiting for several minutes at each of the 4 stops to get to the main lobby. The boats only ran 1/2 the day with at least a 15 minute wait for a boat to arrive - extremely frustrating to simply get from your room to the parking lot....I was not at all impressed. The quickest way to get anywhere was simply walking and not the monorail or the even slower absent boats. We kept discussing how much it must cost to maintain and run this monorail system for 1 resort - quite an endeavour.The resort prices were overwhelming, mixed drinks are $12 compared to other similar resorts on the Islands that charge around $8. We avoided every restarant and bar as we spent $125 for a mexican meal, no drinks for 4 people at the Boats Landing on our 1st night - gasp...The resort was bulit in the late 80s and feels a little dated, but is well maintained. The rooms are clean, large and we had an awesome balconey with a view of the ocean. We changed rooms as our 1st room was infested with little bugs - the hotel quickly resolved this for us.I could only recommend this massive resort if you plan to stay in 1 spot on the Big Island and do not like to explore beyond the walls of the resort. We spent everyday traveling to different spots on the island and this hotel added an 1 hour for inside the resort walking time and then 45 minutes each way to get to any area that offered something interesting.There is no accesible beach in front of the hotel, but a short walk to the south takes you to an amazing small, sandy beach with lots of turtles. The pools are fun, but the water was SOOO cold we could not stand swimming in the pools for longer than an hour.We will avoid this complex in the future and I will not stay at this resort or on this part of the island again on the future. ", " If you're looking to just stay in a hotel and never see another part of the Big Island, this is your place. We were disappointed in the mega-complex and artifice of it all. If you're looking for a more personal, Hawaiian experience, stay away from Waikoloa entirely. ", " I would ONLY recommend this to people looking to stay at their hotel. This may have been our own fault, but anyone with a busy schedule or planning to leave their hotel daily should go somewhere else. We were busy with scuba diving and almost missed our boats because we had to take a shuttle from our room to the lobby and it took FOREVER. This novelty wore off quickly. The food inside the hotel is not good and there is a jungle in the courtyard that had a hundred birds squawking at us all night. Even for families, id recommend going somewhere else. ", " I stayed for 2 nights with my children (10 and 13) at the Waikoloa Hilton. Checkin went reasonable. The room was clean and appropiate furnished. Maintenance: the toilet kept running after every flush and was not repaired despite reporting it, but hey I know how to make a toilet stop running till the next flush without tools.All staff we encountered was friendly and helpfull, but could do nothing for us.The best we received was...\" Oh, that programm was moved to Wednesday...ignore the TV schedule it never gets updated...\" The normal answer was:\" I am sorry, I don't know where that is. Please check the map on the TV or at the train station.So none of the advertised programms my son wanted to do were available or findable even with staff help, but staff was well trained to point us to a chargeable activity. But this was not the worst. When we came back to our room from the pool the first night, we discovered that our cash ($ 58.-) was gone. If you are in a similar situation count your blessings and move on. IF YOU REPORT IT...a very nice security person will have to go through everything....I mean everything in your room to verify that you did not hide the cash somewhere and made the story up....excuse me misplaced...Every suitcase, dirty laundry, bag drawer, space under bed etc. the lock was only checked when requested.4-5 hours later we had a piece of paper that we reported a theft from the room and we were invited to spend some money in the hotel for the dinner we had missed. Breakfast should have been good the next day. Except we took joghurt and when opened it had a furry top. Yes both of them. The waitress was shocked too and very friendly and that was it. It was probably 5 star mold and we did not appreciate it, because yes we were not offered replacement joghurt without mold...so what we had on our table must have been special...noone took it from us.So we went swimming. The pools are not very clean. Swimming bandaids( 5! ) by 11 a.m.One of the two jacuzzy had a slightly green color. But that is nothing to the surroundings of the kona pool. Flying paper plates with mustard and ketchup in the wind. Emty cups, wrappers...No mexican resort looks like this. They try to keep it clean. The Hilton is truly unique.When you sell food shouldn't someone clean up after your costumers? If I did not want it on me I had to put it in the over flowing trash, which shows that some costumers tried. When I requested at the restaurant that someone empty the overflowing trash cans I was informed that it will be done tonight. That is pool service! When I wanted to adress some of these experiences and little annoyances like wrong charges on the check out bill (not from the restaurants-they were accurate) I was told to wait. I checked in every 30 minutes for 2 hours and then I left with a friendly apology from the receptionist who invited me to wait. I believe she was very sorry. She informed me the manager was still talking to other complaining guests!AHH, but at home a survey waited in my email and guess what, I told that survey some of my feelings and received the following email:On behalf of the team of the Hilton Waikoloa Village, please accept my sincere apology for the challenges your experienced during your stay. Our goal is to do whatever we can to ensure our guests leave wanting to return, and obviously we were not successful in our service delivery to you. I have to admit that I am left with more questions than answers at this point, but wanted to reach out to apologize and hopefully have an opportunity to speak to you about your stay in more detail. If you are open to having a conversation about your stay, I would appreciate you responding to this e-mail with convenient days and times during which I could call you.I appreciate your time and candor, for both contribute to helping us improve our operations. I thank you for your consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.I did respond and yes you guessed right heard nothing from them so I wrote this review.Now they do know how to use a phone and an answering machine and email. They left 2 daily marketing messages in the hotel and have been emailing offers quite often ( I imagine staying at a timeshare must feel like it... no other hotel has realy done this to me before)The grounds a beautyfull and clean and large. The staff is friendly. The art is great, but I was glad to leave. It felt great to leave, as if I had managed to get of the hook. The big island is friendly and georgeous. The Mauna Kea is a great hotel, where we never had anything but relaxation. There a lovely condominiums.There are great restaurants and hikes and beaches. The Hilton was the only place that left a bad feeling and gave me a feeling of being trapped. ", " We went during the alchemist festival. Needless to say my three kids saw naked people and people smoking pot. Security came up to us because they thought our kids were too loud in the pool We asked them if they had seen the several couples in the next pool having sex in the pool. It was so large it would take 45 minutes from the parking lot to our room. You needed to take a tram from place to place. We complained and complained and not a single person cared. ", " Start with the infrequent monorail- due to our \"ocean view\" and the train schedule, it's at least 20 minutes to get to your room. You forget something in your room? Delay everything 40 minutes. When we returned with our 6 and 8 year old boys after 10pm, it was more like 40 minutes to the room since the trains are less frequent. The rooms are like any Hampton Inn, though our view was lovely. In a 7+ night stay, not a single employee asked how things were going.This hotel exists for people burning their frequent hotel stay points or on vacation packages. We have met a few people staying since it's featured on Wheel of Fortune. Awesome.Never again. ", " Our room was located in the (basement) of the building at the end of the tram, by the adult pool. The hallway door was filthy, there was a large stain on the carpet in the hall, paint was peeling on our door frame. At night you could hear carts rolling overhead and people's shoes as they walked. We waisted so much time waiting for the tram, and then waiting through all the stops along the way. If I wanted to ride a tram I would have gone to Disney World! They did not have a beach on the ocean, we had to go out and find one. Food was very expensive, the buffet breakfast was $25. per person. There was Japanese artwork all over the place, not Hawaiian, no music at pool, and the adult pool closed at 5 o'clock. Self parking was $15. a day and the lot was a distance away. There were no free ammenities, exersize room, internet - you paid extra. The only positive thing I can say is that the landscaping was nice. ", " I attended a conference at this Hilton the first week of November 2010. Generally speaking the experience was less than good. In fact, it was awful! For starters, You MUST take a monorail or boat to your room. It sometimes took more than 30 minutes to get from the front desk to your room. The food was overpriced and very forgettable. How about spending 12 dollars on one cup of coffee? The internet was spotty and they charged you as much as $12.95 per day. The monorail train was not tall enough for me to enter. I hit my head numerous times. I am only 6'3\"!! Drinks at the many bars on site were watered down and tasteless. Service was slow and snooty. The second morning of our stay my wife and I ate at a Mc Donalds which we considered better than the hotel food! Even if you are attending a conference or a meeting at this hotel resort, AVOID staying there! It is not worth your time! By the way, the luau held at this Hilton was also AWFUL! That was some of the worst pig I have ever eaten in my life!! I wish I could give this hotel a negative score! ", " The ocean tower has thousands of mynah birds nesting outside of the rooms. My family was a wreck due to no sleep. The screeching all night long was insane. The hotel was not able to give us another set of rooms that were equal in size. They offered us smaller rooms with smaller beds in a different tower. We tried to leave but American Airlines had no seats. We toughed it out because we had no other choice. We tried to meet with the manager who was always in meetings or on the phone. They provided no solution for us while we were there. The Hilton has a serious problem with these birds which my kids called rats with wings. They are a nuisance and this hotel has to realize that they can't expect people to put up with it let alone pay good money to stay here. I spent a fortune for 6 sleepless nights here. Don't make the same mistake. ", " Hilton has just ruined my vacation. We're here now, and ended up being put in a Hilton condo with no emenities. no service, no nothing. Miles from the spa and resort hotel. You could imagine my shock at check in! So mad I want to cry. Ruined my vacation, and I'm just mad and sad. Such BS. Never again staying at Hilton. ", " After reading many reviews we chose the lagoon tower because of the location for our young children. First room 1313, had a lot of small cockroaches they sprayed and said come back in an hour...they were much worse!! Moved to another room in front of dolphins, 1326, it was filthy! The floors were white tile and very grimey, baseboards were covered in layers of dirt and the corners of the room were a line of caked on dirt where they must mop and miss??? There was apparently a past water leak and the wall next to the tv looked like it was patched by a 5 year old. My daughters feet were black when she had just taken a bath, the whole room in the bottom floor (cabana rooms) are tiled this way. This is NOT a good choice, especially to pay more???? The manager said this is the last tower that needs an upgrade other towers have already been done.... they need to speed it up and stop charging more for these rooms in the process!!!! BE WARNED. We moved to the Palace tower and had no problems, also my sister was in the Ocean tower and it was clean and nice. Other then that, hotel is beautiful and both mangaers and all staff I delt with were terrific! Okay maybe NOT the housekeeper that was cleaning room 1326 she might need a new job and I asked her supervisor (housekeeping manager) to come and view the room (she did not show). They did send a guy to come and deep clean because I did not want to change rooms again, he wiped a few baseboards and said this is neglect It will take me hours to clean this. I did take pictures to show hotel manager after he cleaned and threw in the towel... I wish I could find an email address to email the Hilto Corporate office how bad the room looks, maybe they might speed up the upgrades! This hotel is way to beautiful to have rooms looking like this!!! ", " My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and had so many issues that we decided to leave a few days early. Pros: wonderful massages, housekeeping staff is very professional, valet staff is exceptionalCons: every restaurant we tried was awful, horrible service from waiters/waitresses, front desk staff is incompetentI would not recommend this hotel to anyone. We enjoyed our stay in Kona and Volcano and thought that the big island was a great experience except for this... ", " Having traveled to Hawaii 20+ times I was looking forward to another relaxing and fun filled vacation. I knew traveling with our infant daughter that the relaxing part might be a stretch but staying at the Hilton made it even worse. This place is a facade. It is trying to be Hawaii in the middle of Hawaii! You could take this resort and plop it down in the middle of Orlando or Las Vegas and get the same feel. Everything here is mass produced and not geniune. You feel like you are on a cruise ship, walking miles to eat and swim, or waiting half an hour for your luggage etc. While the staff was nice and the rooms were large and clean you just dont truly feel like you are in Hawaii. I know everyone says this place is like Dsineyland and it's true. I mean come on a tram to your room? Who wants that feeling when your in such a gorgeous place as Hawaii? While some people may like this disconnect from the true Hawaii, it was not for us. There are so many better hotels to stay at (kauai marriott, kauai grand hyatt, four seasons on maui etc.) I would take a hard look at what you want out of your vacation before staying here. If you like loud, over the top cheesy, and feeling like a cattle then this may be the place for you....on a side note the hotel workout area is awful. For a property that large to have such a small gym with half of them not working is a shame. Also the golf courses on property were in horrible shape. You can tell that they are cutting corners due to the downturn in tourism. The greens were horrible and the amenties were slim to none. Spend a little more and play mauna kea or hapuna much better courses and way prettier.Also the fact they charge you 21 bucks a night for valet and 14 for self park is a joke,that is a cash cow for them and just a way to gouge you, most people have cars and they should give you the option of free self parking because there is no free parking at all around the area!!!!! ", " Read many reviews on trip advisor that said this place was great, somehow I dont think my family and I stayed at the same place. From checking in to trying to get a towel at the pool, nobody cared that we even existed. Drove up and stood around for a half hour because nobody wanted to help us with our bags. Finally got checked in and got to our rooms which were dirty and old. Thought we had got on a time machine back to the 1970's. Right outside our room was a huge flcok of birds which did a great job of waking us and our two children up at 6 A.M. These birds are not the migrating type,,,in other words they will always be there. Not a few but like hundreds in the trees in the middle of the resort. Very Very loud. Not a big fan of that on a vacation. Also all rooms on the lagoon tower are outside rooms. In other words all the doors exit to the outside. No hallway. So you are going to hear alot of outside noise. The food was shabby to say the most. They didn't even give the standard complimentary glasses of water with room service. And there is none in the room to drink. Since we were up early we tried to get a head start at the pool. Went to get some towels, but the resort didnt have any, although this is included in your resort fee that you pay for every day. Told us the dryer was broken and \"oh well\". The tram and train take a LONG time. We were lucky when we first got there to catch the train but every time after that we just walked. From the lagoon tower it wasn't the worlds longest hike but If we had stayed in the ocean tower (which were were supposed to origninaly) it would have killed us with two toddlers. The boat always said arrival in 20 min. Talk about waisting your vacation time. No thanks. We had that sinking feeling, and after being there for almost a day, we decided to cut our losses. We checked out and went to another resort on the island only five minutes away (Fairmont Orchid)...less expensive, service was a million times better, pools were awesome, has a great beach for kids, food is better...etc etc etc. Not enough room here to write how much better it is. Lesson learned! Bottom line is ...dont waste your time at the Hilton Waikoloa! on a side note I will say that we went back to do the dolphin quest WEE Tots program. We already had a reservation and wanted to experience the dolphins. They were great. Totally worth the money. Do it if you can. Otherwise this hotel is a zoo ...literally ", " Waikoloa is beautiful, and the Big Island is one of our favorite places. We chose the Hilton hotel to get married at because of this. From the start they seemed great. They provided a wedding planner (Heather) and assured us that they could do what we wanted. After a year of planning, they screwed it all up. Heather decided to go on vacation for the week of our wedding but did not tell us. We found out when we arrived for the rehearsal. They 'forgot' to turn on the AC in the ball room until after the ceremony. They messed up the Ice sculpture. (not even close to the picture we sent) We paid for everything 5 days before (over 20k), and we were staying in the hotel, but they still felt the need to have my wife sign off on some receipts during the reception dinner! The alternate wedding planner must have had a date or something because she could not be found to explain why this receipt was so necessary and could not wait until tomorrow.A week later they sent an evaluation form via email so I informed them how it turned out, and how upset my wife was, Hilton did nothing. Not even an apology. There are better places in Waikoloa, consider yourself warned. ", " I was appalled by the capture and treatment of the dolphins. What a disgrace, making dolphins, one of earth's most intelligent creatures, do tricks for tourists. ", " Is in the worst place of the island, where more wind.No Beach. No Beach.Swmingpools small, with a lot of people, bad level.Room dirty, with bugs.Service is bad, because is very little. This is not a hotel is a fake, you have to walk every day to everything.Bad taste. Go to every where, near is Mauna Lani for example. ", " First of all if you\u2019re going to travel to this resort and don't want to hire a bell-man pack light, as this resort is huge and getting your bags from the reception desk to your room is a major feat. You will need to drag them for miles, or wait for the extremely slow and busy tram, or the boat.After checking in we spent hours wandering the grounds to explore the resort and only saw a small portion of it. After all that work we got back to our room for the first time after check in to get ready for dinner. That was when my wife found the toilet full of urine and cigarette buts... :( The bathroom had obviously not been cleaned upon the last check out, and overall it was very dirty.After two calls to the front desk housekeeping came and swished the bathroom. We asked to talk to a manager about our displeasure that night and again the next day and it never happened. It is obvious that these people just don't care...We were so mad we lugged our four large suitcases to the parking lot ourselves, and it seemed a mile away. After we checked out we left for Kona Village Resort down the road. Now that's a place to stay if you want clean rooms and good service... ", " We have returned from Hawaii's Big Island only a few days ago...and i really wish we picked some other place.Hotel was Hilton Waikoloa, and that place was clean, but extremely overpriced (small tiny hamburger was 14$ and plain bagel 5$).Restaurants are at least 50 per person without wine,drinks or dessert. If you don't have a car, you are sentenced to stay there with no entertainment, rude employees and nothing to do or see. If you do have a car, you will have to pay 15$ daily. When I complained about that, reception clerk told me that this is Hawaii and that everything is overpriced ??!! If you go to the city, 23 miles away is almost the same thing, and the only thing worth (or not worth for that money) of being in Hawaii are spectacular sunsets, black sand beaches and flora. Hawaiian hospitality, and I am saying this seriously, is only a myth. Next time, Mexican Riviera Maya where we went last year, is all inclusive, cheaper, closer and with extremely kind employees. Or some other, new place but not Hawaii... ", " |My wife and I recently stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa on a package that was sent to me by Hilton Honors. I bought the package because I wanted to see the big island and perhaps purchase another time share. I have to say the Hilton was an unbelievable disappointment from the very beginning. We did not feel welcome at all, To start our room, which was supposed to be an ocean view king, did not have an ocean view but a view of the Palace tower. When we attempted to use the gym we were told that there is a fee of twenty dollars a day for access. When I discussed this with the desk they told me that I could join a group that would give me access to several discounts, including access to the gym for four dollars and fifty cents a day. I asked hy they did not offer that first and I was told that it was theresult of a class action lawsuit and they only had to sell \"so many\" of those group things and then it would go back to twenty dollars a day. This is on top of the 21.00 a day for parking. The visit went down hill from there and the icing on the cake was when we attended the time share presentation. We made the mistake of mentioning a few things that were not satisfactory and we were told \" Well, if you pay more you get treated better\". I almost fell out of my chair. I can't believe that this is the Hilton or anything close to the best they have to offer, but I can assure you I will never go to the Hilton Waikoloa again. ", " Been going to the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, which became the Hilton Waikoloa, almost every year since 1985 - shopping and drinks and dinner at the Kamuela Provision Company. Free parking and reasonable prices. Had not been there for five years and went there today. Wow, what a change! Now is costs $15 to self-park. The shops have little selection and some were closed. The restaurant was not open yet at 4:00 PM nor was the bar. The menu is now such that it would be difficult to get out of there for $70 per person. If they are trying to discourage people from patronizing their facility, they are doing an outstanding job. Looks like they have taken to gouging the public to make up for high vacancy rates. We have dumped the Hilton from our list.ScottySept. 23, 2009 ", " What a let down this place was!! It is huge and you can't get anywhere except by train or boat where you're crammed in with load mouthed convention people and screaming kids. This \"resort\" is everything you're trying to escape when you go on vacation: crowds, long lines, no or very poor service, rip off prices, stress and aggravation.. Prepare to spend a good chunk of your time waiting for transportation and waiting on transportation.....oh, and you'll need to kill some pretty large cockroaches. The rooms and old furniture are dingy, rugs and curtains very stained. Very impersonal and about half of the staff never learned common courtesy. Forget getting help from the concierge.........it's a front for their condo sales teams who are relentless in their shameless sales techniques........you'll just be another sales lead at this place. You can't even use their facilities, including gym, without paying for it!! The main pool looks good until you try and go in and find that it's freezing! That's if you can even find a seat by the pool. We've been to a lot of luxury hotel resorts and even at capacity, they seem to manage to accomodate their guests. Not here..........they've overbuilt the place and at full capacity, don't have the resources or staff to handle the crowds.....nor do they seem to care. ", " We had booked this as part of our honeymoon and it was totally unsuitable. There were drunk people and huge families shouting at each other all over the resort. You couldn't find anywhere quiet to sit unless you rented a cabana at $150 per day. You were expected to wear a wristband so that you wouldn't nick the towels. The beds were painted but the paint was flaking off to reveal white plastic beneath. you struggled to see the ocean from our ocean view apartment. Only 2 of the 3 restaurants were open- we went to the chinese and 4 dishes with 2 cokes came to $120 and we were sat next to a table of 10 teenagers. It was just so unsuitable for a honeymoon it was unbelievable! Not entirely the Hilton's fault, we were seriously mis-sold this by our travel agent. We managed one night and then paid a significant sum to get out! Fine place if you have children but not a place if you are adults wanting to relax. For such a massive resort they cram everyone into the smallest spaces. It was as though Benidorm had found it's way into the middle of the Pacific. ", " The last time we stayed here, there was nothing negative that I could have written. This time things have changed. As a result, I would not recommend this hotel, nor would I stay here again. The lagoon water, which my family has always considered a highlight, has become murky. We have definitely noticed a change in upkeep of the property as well. The rooms are dated and could use a renovation. (Think 1970s ish hawaiian hotel theme complete with the big tv in the big tv hotel cabinet with drawers.) There is no wi fi in the rooms, but there is corded internet service. There is public wi fi but we didn't find it. Also the hotel charges extra for everything. Internet service - fee. Gym (treadmills bicycle) - fee. Valet and self parking - fee. Gym classes - extra fee in addition to gym fee. Newspaper - fee. Bottled water - fee. Forget to turn in your pool towels? There's a fee for that ($25/towel). And on top of this the hotel charges, yes, you guessed it, a resort fee. I just feel that the hotel has lost its appeal to us considering we used to stay here when things were different. It almost appears as if the hotel may be getting ready to be sold. It just had a completely different vibe to it. I definitely would not recommend it anymore. ", " From the time we arrived, the service was awful. At the check-in counter, they had one person checking people in. We waited over 20 minutes to get up to the counter and we were the first people in line. That didn't leave a good first impression, but it went downhill from there. Every meal on the property was an ordeal. One night, we went to the Japanese restaurant on the property. We couldn't get a reservation until 8:00, but when we got there the place was half-empty. We figured it was because they were understaffed. After being seated, no one acknowledged us or offered us water or anything to drink for about 20 minutes until we got up and left. The meal service elsewhere at this resort was similar.The room was not as we had booked. We wanted a separate sleeping area for the kids, but they provided a standard room with one king bed and a small twin sofa bed, then tried to charge us $45.00 per night for a rollaway bed (we got them to waive that) They offered to upsell us to a larger room later which wasn't a good option for us. Of course, when they talked to our travel agent, they lied and said they offered the Presidential Suite at no additional charge (of course we would have taken that!). All in all, they have decent amenities and it is attractive property, but the bad service all around was frustrating and I would recommend avoiding this hotel. ", " Extremely expensive. Had to pay for everything. Self prepared in-room coffee $3.95 per one cup package if you used the service. Food cold and poor quality. Pool water so cold our 4-year old grandson couldn't stand it -- I barely did. Had to pay for water sports equipment. Little or nothing to do at the resort if you are not into sun bathing. Will not go back again. Few TV channels, most were advertisement for the hotel. No ocean beach. ", " We travel extensively, and this was unquestionably not one of our favorite properities. With the exception of housekeeping and valet parking, staff are generally indifferent. With the exception of the ocean view restaurant and some items on the Chinese menu you are much better off to dine elsewhere. Several restaurants were closed down. We had a pre-packaged breakfast at one of the poolside cafes, and it was $35 for sub-par Jack-in-the-Box egg burrito and coffee.This might be fun if you have small kids, are not terribly active, or this is your first trip. There is great SCUBA diving and other activities both north and south, and much nicer accomodations for substantially less cost.By all means don't up-grade your room. We paid for an ocean view and had a great look at another hotel with palm trees somethat blocking that view. Nothing anyone could do to fix it.Great area: sub-par property and management. This is apparently well known in the area, as we received great recommendations for other hotels. ", " Friends, my wife and I have been going to the Hilton Wiakoloa for 20 years. In the last few years the hotel had started to go down hill in all aspects (service, maintenance, cleaniness, etc.) We were disguisted with our entire stay this January 2009. From rude TV production personnel closing off areas of the hotel and grounds. It appears this place is in a downward spiral! Go to the Four Seasons! Don't waste your time or money here!MIke and CarlaP.S. We are Hilton HHonors DIamond Members which entitles us to the best room available and Executive Floor benefits. Needless to say our room was not even near the best. Other than free breakfast, all the benefits are gone!!!! The Hilton Wiakoloa eliminated both the Diamond and Gold HHonors rooms. This is now a 2 star hotel at best! ", " Food: Go to the lower lobby, ask for the tram to Queen's court. Go to Macaroni Grill. Ask for Romeo, Tell him the Hungry People sent you. We're DONE. If you stop reading now, you'll be FINE here.However On-site food was my BIG issue:Coffee: No Starbuck's. And that isn't good. Even if you hate Starbuck's, it isn't good. Kill it down with sugar and half-half.Snacks: Figure twice greedy Theatre pricing, dubious shelf aging. No newspapers from anywhere but here. 99cent corkscrew seen in Queens villiage, is $3.99 here.Chinese Restaurant For Two: Ick shrimp, ate two (they took full plate away, discounted IT 10%, whoopie!), heaved same 12 hours later. She kept hers, Figure ~$90 to keep something down from here.Room service For (Relatively) Healthy Wife: $90 and about an hour gets a CHEESEBURGER and ONE 750ml Chardo. Burger good, Chardo slightly better than $6 water at The Orchid Cafe.Italian Resto: Too sick, Mother Nature forces us to cancel. Hug your Mother.Dolphin-Side Grill Place: $17 gets $2.45 San Jose \"White Truck\" Burger, Fries. Everything Zipped cold by wind blowing through whole place. I don't eat cold fries, can't comment on quality. Looked good, tho. Honestly, I didn't mean the Dolphin. Watching her eat a big Ahi Steak sandwich here was just freaking SPOOKY, and how would I explain this to the kids?. Big, HOO-RAY LUAU!!: Moved to basement ballroom 1.5 hours prior to showtime. I'm NOT kidding. Smelled of musty conventions with people Mom would pull me away from. Those people weren't there. Wife was behind another sheep, just like me. Sheep food seems to have no ambient olefactory component (OK, I can't smell any good food while waiting). I'm hungry.Plates dirty, old food clings openly to ALL...Desperately pushed ahead but a trusting cow, I select blind and proceed to load up on the tasty morsels seen (over and OVER, over and OVER) on the room's closed circuit TV. I am SO hungry, this IS day #4.Not ONE dish from the obviously old footage is here. We got some potato salad, Caesar, Some Hacked Up Chicken, and oily-looking veggies in Oil Sauce.The Fabled BBQ PIG of Hawai'i is a big serve tray of pulled pork, shredded beyond recognition. But plenty of yummy Oil Sauce is here!It's PICKED over. We're 4th or so table from the last for call to serve (it's a \"buffet\"), I look about for attendants with fresh trays of ready, NICE looking food.They AREN'T coming, and it's obvious. I make it to the end of the line, I've now also got a cold purple-colored dinner roll, and some ice cold butter pat to go with it. Darn, no nuke to heat this old roll here, even?We sit down. Not Don Ho tiredly starts his reluctant dinner show, and really, if he could have a hug, it could be a good evening. Were out of hugs, too.The \"Dinner Show\" is one like I haven't seen before. Brave, Talented (I could see this, but with a seven-foot ceiling, , well, come ON) performers, all without direly needed props. Nobody is drinking their \"free\" Blue \"drinks\"...hoisting them helps it go un-noticed. A bit. Wifey sings along, evidently hugging me back alive this morning has given her some special powers. I hope she hasn't consumed the Blue Kool-aid.With us is a sweet family from New York, and isn't it cruel this will be \"Hawai'i to them\". They seem to have brought along enough hugs for the family. They nearly shared with us. A glance around at malingering, hugless staff could tell anyone thist would be foolhardy.I've confirmed Oily Sauce is not on the Send a Case Home List. Hacked Chicken IS, by contrast. I had this chicken once at Jantzen Beach. THIS chicken, tho. He probably knew my Dad. I love animals. This one was OK, and I was in no place to give him a hug. Poor Hacked Chicken, we hardly knew ya.I've found a chunk of something NOT on the TOP of my plate, on the BOTTOM of my plate. Ooh, ick. I had NO plan to harm anybody today, but...The table helper asks is everything \"alright\"...I hand her my plate, tell her to watch her fingers on the bottom, and ask can we start this over. Politely.My plate is whisked away. I sit there, wondering. I walk back out to the \"buffet\" tble, it's being cleared. No dinner for me. I'm hungry.No bother, I couldn't eat now anyway. Let's say I seen/tasted Jail food, and well, I was being harsh. Sorry, Cookie.Thinking of the dirty plate (the show is no good distraction), my Hacked Chicken changes his mind about our realationship. I'm hugging him, he 's not having it. I take off to the bathroom. Not Don Ho is in the dusty foyer, I'm sure rehearsing sounds just like muttering in true, native Hawai'ian. What a Trooper.Back at the table. Wifey has valiantly stood for my honour, however my return has somewhat unraveled her story of my imminent death. Now I need a hug, and I'm still hungry.I went to bed, she saw an abbreviated fire show outside. Sounded Kinky.She told this story better, got the $190 back. Nice. 20 year old place, looks it. No bugs seen. Not going back, was insulted by the price gouging. This place, is NOT Hawai'i. ", " I stayed at the Hilton to attend a wedding. This is a beautiful place to be but the customer service (when it's actually available) is awful. You can walk around the hotel grounds for 20 minutes and not ever cross paths with an employee. The wedding service was absolutely horrible and lacking. From the moment I arrived at the hotel it was nothing but problems. As soon as my boyfriend, his daughter and I arrived, an employee at the front of the hotel took our car and left. We were not provided with a valet card, parking ticket or anything else which would indicate where our car was and what the cost of parking would be. I was checked into the wrong room and tower. When I asked employees questions about the Hilton's shops or restaurants, all I ever got was \"I don't know.\" Never a \"let me check on that for you\", nothing. Our room phone kept blinking with messages and they were all from hotel employees trying to sell us hotel services. It was ridiculous. ", " This review is for a day pass only- I was so grateful we weren't actually staying here!! We took the kids here to have fun on the water slides- which they did. When we asked the front desk about a day pass we were informed that for a family of 4 it would be $160- which included a room for day use until 6pm. However, we were a family of 7- and we didn't want a room! They insisted that this was the only way we could use the pools, and that we would have to buy 2 rooms- $320 to use the pools! Finally for some mysterious reason the woman at the front desk relented, and let us have the one room for $160. Thank goodness! So that was one good thing. The day room was in the Lagoon tower, and was a regular guest room. Very small and dark. I would have been very sad had I been checking in and this was my room! The other thing we noticed were the smells- and not good Hawaii ones either. The hallways outside of the elevator stunk like sewer, the room smelled, around the pool smelled, a strong stench of chlorine mixed with sewer- yuck! Add to that the way the Hilton is decorated in a pseudo-museum style, and the fact that it has no beach- it made me wonder why anyone would bother to fly all the way to Hawaii when the could have easily had this experience for much less $$ in Las Vegas- and Vegas would probably be cleaner!! The positive reviews astonish me, and frankly sound fake. All of us (except for the 4 year old who LOVED the water slides and wanted to move there permanently) agreed that this was the absolute worst of Hawaii- very expensive, no beach, and absolutely no soul. Sad! ", " We have just left the Hilton Waikoloa 7 days earlier than planned. We had booked a 9 night stay however after experiencing the complete lack of service and terrible food in their restaurants, we packed up and moved to the Mauna Lani Resort just a few miles away.This was our second stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. The first stay was 5 years ago. The property was and still is a beautiful property. Very big and beautifully landscaped. The service was great and the food was very good. This experience prompted us to return for a second visit. Wrong decision!This time however we were in for a big surprise which I sensed the minute we checked in. We were in the Lagoon Tower with a beautiful view of the ocean and dolphin lagoon. The problem with this location is that the nearby pool has no shade. There are no trees, umbrellas or cabanas to protect you from the sun. If you are looking for a cabana or some sun protection, the only pool that has a handful of cabanas is the Kohala pool by the Ocean Tower which is a fifteen minute walk from the Lagoon Tower. Very inconvenient. I had requested the Ocean Tower when my reservation was made knowing this distance issue however the Ocean Tower was sold out and the Hilton did nothing to try to accommodate me despite my Gold Hilton Honors status. So, we walked to our cabana of which Hilton charged $50 a day . We soon discovered that there was no poolside service. No one asking you for drink or food orders. NOBODY! You had to get your own. I am sorry but if I am staying at a resort, which this property supposedly is, I expect a little service. NOTHING!! We were told by a staff member that the pool service was discontinued but we could order room service if we wanted. We did and waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to have cold pre-made salads delivered to the cabana. The salad was awful on top of it all.There is a snack bar at the pool with sandwiches and beverages but the hours have been reduced from 10AM to 5PM and now is only open from 11AM to 1 PM. Outside of those hours you must order room service but you have to figure that out for yourself. There are no menus for room service to be had at the poo!That evening we ate at the Kamuela Provision Company on property which we liked during our previous trip. Again, I sensed staff issues at the restaurant.The meal was terrible. We both ordered a local fish dish which was dry and tasteless. The waiter tried to make up for slow service by offering a free appetizer but we were not pleased overall.I was totally disappointed the next morning when we decided to look for another property. We checked out.The bottom line:We were informed by hotel staff that the hotel staff has been reduced by 50%. This was very obvious.The staff with whom we had contact did an excellent job at their tasks; however, the difference is that when the staff was reduced services were simply discontinued as opposed to being assumed by other employees.Do yourself a favor. Avoid the Hilton Waikoloa at all costs! ", " First of all, they should indicate it is a 10 minute walk from the lobby to the hotel room. Yes they have a ship or train to take you but they are so slow that walking is quicker. Then they block off most of the carpark for their ADP convention that other hotel guests have to park at the furthest 2 rows at the perphery of the lot. That takes an addition 5 min walk. Food in the executive floor equates to free breakfast at Econo lodge food plus some fresh island fruits. We paid $400 a night for this. The room is dated with wear and tear. Even the marble slab in my sink has a chunk missing from it. I asked the front desk if the room was not renovated and she said they already been renovated. This room is truly nothing special.The resort are really good for family with young kids only. It is not for family with teenagers. Even my 12 year old wanted to leave early but we prepaid for 4 nights.What can say about this hotel?? I guess the linens are soft. Too bad I forgot my digital camera but you truly don;t want to pay $400 a night to stay here. Even the Hilton people admiited that if it was not for the convention, there were hardly any guests. Don;t waste your money, look somewhere else. ", " We are veteran Hawaii vacationers and have stayed at the Grand Wailea, Embassy Suites and Weston in Maui and Royal Hawaiian in Oahu. This hotel was the worst property we have ever stayed at in terms of service and value for the buck. The restaurants are very expensive for mediocre food. The property is just too large. So there is too much walking or waiting for the tram/boat. Also, we were repeatedly incorrectly charged at the restaurant and parking when we had already pre-paid these expenses. The room we originally received was a view of the roof when we paid for a golf view. Though the staff tried to make amends, it seems this property is VERY POORLY MANAGED. We will never go back nor stay at a Hilton property again! ", " Wow. . . I couldn't WAIT to get home to write a review about this place! My husband and I were fooled into booking a room last August through a \"deal\" with Hilton Grand Vacations. What a mistake. After paying over $1700 and having to listen to ANOTHER two hour presentation for the \"ownership rip-off\", we found that other Hilton guests were staying for less than $100 per night. Upon arrival after a very lengthy trip from Cleveland, Ohio, I had to call security twice because local residents were staying at the hotel for the 4th of July \"special\" of $99 for the week-end. Huge numbers of families (children AND adults) were running up and down the hallway, screaming and laughing far into the night. We believed that by Sunday night, the only guests using the resort would be tourists. WRONG!!! The Hilton has a public parking lot where anyone can pay to park (we had to pay $12 per night - and no, this wasn't for valet), and there is no one monitoring who is using the facilities. All of the pool areas were crammed each day with locals and their families who were not paying guests of the hotel.Now, let's talk about the room and the parking. Seriously, how could anyone describe this Hilton as a four or five star resort??? Our room was TINY and crummy. We would have done just as well at a Motel 8. To walk to the front desk or the parking lot took us 14 minutes unless we chose to wait for the boat (which was often too crowded to ride) or the train that had signs stating all week that the \"air conditioning is broken - sorry\". These options of travel only ran once every 15 minutes and you had to hope that the vehicle was going in the right direction or the wait would be even longer. Once we made the trek to the parking lot, it was always a guessing game where we were parked. Like I said, anyone can park in the lot, and the employees always took the spots that were closest to the entrance. Sometimes, we had to walk about 6 - 7 minutes through the parking lot to our car. Keep in mind, that we just walked 14 minutes from our room. This was loads of fun when we had to take our luggage to our car! Now, why did we rent a car if we were staying at a resort? Because the prices were OUTRAGEOUS! A small bottle of Diet Coke was over $2.50. A sandwich plus a bag of chips cost $14.00. No kidding. Every day we drove 15 minutes to Waikoloa Village to the grocery store. We couldn't stock up on cold food items because the OLD ugly brown refrigerator with the broken and missing metal shelf bar only held two bottles of water and three cans of Diet Coke. Also, since we are a couple without children, we were in for quite a surprise to find out that the one and only \"lounge\" closed by 11:00pm each night. Oh, and a beer cost over $5.00. While there, the Japanese restaurant called Imari literally closed its doors forever. That's how wonderful this resort is.Overall, I highly recommend that anyone planning on staying at the Hilton in Waikoloa either look elsewhere, or take advantage of the incredible rates that all of the other guests who weren't screwed over by Hilton Grand Vacations received. Did I mention that we had been promised a two-bedroom condo last August for the price, but when I called January 3rd to reserve a condo, they were already all booked? Do the math. Six months ahead of our vacation and NONE of the condos were available? So for the same price, we were stuck in a small, out-dated hotel room with tons of locals. Nice.P.S. I would share photos, but I only took them of the BEAUTIFUL Big Island that we plan on returning to some day and stay somewhere that does not bear the Hilton name. I was too heart-broken and ticked off to actually preserve the memory of the \"resort.\" ", " I'll try to be short with this as to explain the true horror of this place would take too long.The rooms are outdated and poorly maintained, they're tatty and pretty grubby, our room smelt like it had been flooded and then left to dry, it was musty and horrible, we stayed in the Ocean Tower. The corridors are open air on the side we stayed on so that you can hear the constant noise of birds/people/whatever all day and night.The restaurants are a joke, you need a reservation to eat at any of them as one particular evening we walked to all of the restaurants on this 22 acre property and all were full. There is nowhere off site to eat unless you pay $2 each to get a trolley bus down the road to a food hall. If you do have the joy of eating in any of the restaurants we found the food to be well overpriced and poor. We made the mistake of going to the buffet breakfast one morning and were charges $60 (for 2 of us), the food was completely geared towards american living and we found that we couldn't eat a lot of the food. We also found that there were basically no vegetarian options other than cake, the whole place was steak or some form of meat on everything!Talking of eating a lot of the places to eat were open air, this is a nice idea except for the constant birds flying in and out. This would also be fine if we didn't notice that birds were basically fouling on the tables and chairs, when people were getting up to go and get a drink birds would go on their tables and walk on their food. We were frequently sitting on chairs or tables full of bird poo that no one appeared to be bothered about or attempted to clean up?The idea of tipping in the USA is fine, we get that, what we don't get is why at the Hilton Waikoloa you are expected to pay a 20% tip? At the end of the day any tips are discretionary? So the more you spend the more that you have to tip regardless of the fact that we found the majority of the staff to be incredibly rude, unhelpful and basically racist towards the fact that we are English to the point where some of them were telling us they couldn't understand us???? We were speaking English?? We found ourselves repeating any requests at least 5 times which is ridiculous.To top this off in the Mahalo lounge (i think that's what it was called) we paid our tab after eating there, when the waitress returned with our change she had helped herself to a 20% tip?? We explained to her that it was up to us to decide what tip to leave, to be honest we felt that this was pretty much akin to stealing.If you are American then I am sure this place is ideal, it has the food you like, the people you like etc etc. For anyone else we felt that we were basically discriminated against because we were not American. I won't give you all of the gory details but my husband was told on at least 5 different occassions that he couldn't be understood. We asked to use a PC and were told that there weren't any, when we found that there were we were treated like dirt by the lady there and observed her quite blatently treating an american gentleman that walked in in a helpful manner. I was subject to abuse by a gentleman at the pool because I have a tatoo??This place seriously needs to get a grip. It is obviously geared towards american tourists which is fine, and to be honest I doubt that they could really give a fig about anyone non american because not enough of us visit the place to make it an issue if we didn't visit! By all means visit and make your own mind up but be prepared! ", " Although we had paid Hotels.com the higher rate for an ocean view room with king-sized bed several months in advance of our arrival at the hotel, when we arrived at the hotel, we were told they did not have any such room available. Instead, they had only a room with two double beds overlooking a driveway. When I stated that we not only had reserved the ocean view room in advance, but had actually paid the entire fee in advance for such a room, they only repeated they had no such room available. They did eventually offer to comp us for the first night in the lesser room, but since we were only staying in the hotel for two nights, their selling of more rooms than they actually had available resulted in the ruin of half of our stay. It should be noted that the hotel's assistant manager tried valiantly the next day to fix the situation, but of course, the damage was done. It should also be noted that Hotels.com also refused to help fix the problem, even though we had actually paid the advance hotel fees through them. ", " First, let me say that I have never written a negative review about anything, much less a hotel. I always try to find something to like. But from the moment I arrived at the Hilton Waikoloa, I was disappointed. The person checking us in was incredibly rude and could not find our reservation, so we asked if perhaps it had been misspelled. She insisted it was not. She then goes to her manager to see if we can STILL stay at the hotel (it is now 8 pm), manager says \"yes\", but she then informs us that we will have to pay for two rooms if there is indeed a reservation under the wrong name (which would have of course been the hotel's fault). Whatever happened to Rule #1, the customer is always right? Well, guess what. After our insistence that she try multiple spellings of the last name, she finds it, but is still rude about it. And folks, I am a nice person. This transaction left us exhausted. We go to the room where we see this cute little stuffed dolphin on the bed that my son immediately hugs and wants to keep, only to discover it will cost $15! He is in tears. So the fun just keeps going. It is a long walk to anywhere, although you can wait for a tram or boat. There is nothing as far as entertainment at night, with the exception of a jazz singer (who was lovely) and the bars close at midnight on a weekend. Did I mention that the water in the pool was FREEZING? Too cold to swim in. Our mantra during our 2 day stay was \"we're never coming back, we're never coming back, we're never coming back.\" ", " Wow. The property is simply beautiful. We stayed in the Ocean Tower on the 8th floor and the view was incredible The pools, canals and rooms are really great. It's easily the nicest looking resort I've stayed at. The only thing that marred this experience was the lousy food, weak service and gouging. Each of the buildings is quite beautiful. Unfortunately, they each contain a bad restaurant, a really bad snack bar and an incredibly overpriced store. The snack bars basically serve up food that makes you long for a Jack In The Box. Imagine a regular Jack In The Box burger with curly fries, now burn it a bit and charge $13.00 for it. Don\u2019t forget to add $4.00 for a fountain soda. The breakfast buffet was edible food, about what you would get from a Denny\u2019s. The only difference is that it cost you $28.00. per person. A cocktail in a throwaway 8oz cup at the bar will cost you $10.50. If you plan to have a few drinks by the pool and a snack bar lunch, plan on bringing about $60.00 per person. Dinner and a few drinks will be closer to $100 to $150 per person. A 20oz bottle of soda will run you $4.00 at the little store in each tower. The coke machine on each floor seems to offer a deal. It\u2019s $1.50 for a can of soda. Sadly, it simply took my money and didn\u2019t provide soda. An offer by the front desk to drop a refund off at my door never materialized. The correct response would have been to bring a few cans of soda promptly.I would recommend that anyone staying here research other places to dine. The food and drinks are dramatically overpriced and the quality is non existent. It\u2019s a shame the such a beautiful place has such horrible offerings. ", " My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa for 2 nights in December 2007.The grounds are beautiful and there are lots of fun activities for kids if you have kids (although you need to pay extra for them), but the service is terrible and that completely ruined my stay. Let me explain what I mean by terrible service:1) We arrived late at night after a very long trip (we flew from the East Coast). After taking a 15 minute train-ride, we arrived at the room and found out that the key was not working. We went back to the lobby to reprogram the key, with an assurance from the desk agent that the key would work. The key did not work once again, so yet another time we went back to the front desk \u2013 this time, though we were initially told to try the keys again, we insisted on another solution. The clerk called for security to come to the room. After a 30 minute wait, security finally comes and opens our door with a master key. As the security guy is about to leave, we have to explain to him that it does not really solve our problem b/c we still don\u2019t have a key that works and won\u2019t be able to go back and forth to our room. The security guy looks surprised, he thought he had solved our problem by opening the door. We ask him to call the manager. He tells us the manager is somewhere else on the property and will come later. We ask for another room, thinking that might be faster. We were told we needed to wait for the manager for that as well. We waited for the manager to come. The manager finally arrived and rolling her eyes at me and pointing to my husband, she says: \u201cHe wants another room,\u201d as if to say: I don\u2019t understand why that annoying guest wants another room. The least she could have done was apologize for the key, but she did not apologize. She gets us another room with a key that\u2019s working. Finally !!!! Overall, it took more than an hour for us to get a room with a key that was working! This is really annoying when it\u2019s late and you\u2019re tired from your trip. The crazy thing is that they could not have cared less and did not bother apologizing or saying anything nice to make us feel better.2) The next day, we go to the pool. There is a pool with a small slide and I used the slide several times in the morning, which was fun, and then I wanted to use it again in the afternoon. As I come up to the slide in the afternoon, a staff member tells me I cannot use the slide. I ask why, she tells me I don\u2019t have a wristband. I explain I used the slide before in the morning and was never told about a wristband. She tells me I absolutely cannot use the slide without a wristband to show that I am a hotel guest and \u201cfor security reasons\u201d. She was so unfriendly that I did not want to use the slide anymore. I tell the story to my husband and he says he will get me a wristband. 20 minutes later, I see my husband coming to our seats with yet another staff member. My husband tells me the staff member did not believe that I existed and therefore did not want to give him a wristband without having seen me in person, which is why the staff member followed my husband to our seats!!! Accusing guests of lying is just terrible customer service.3) I went to get towels at the pool. I was told I needed to sign a paper. The paper said that you need to return the towels together with the receipt (for verification purposes) at the end of the day, otherwise you are charged $35. $35 seems a lot of money just for not returning towels on time, but anyway I sign the paper and proceed to take the receipt. The woman starts yelling at me that I am not allowed to take the receipt with me. I tell her that I just signed a paper saying that I need to return the receipt together with the towels to avoid the fee and therefore I want the receipt. She tells me a very complicated story that I barely understood all the while yelling at me so I end up taking the towels without the receipt, worrying about being charged $35 at some point. What shocked me about this experience is the complete lack of concern for customer service. The woman was unfriendly and rude and could not have cared less.4) One more thing, my husband went to get a glass of tap water. He was told he needed to pay 26 cents for each glass of TAP water !!!All of this happened in only 1 day !!!! I don\u2019t know what else would have happened had we stayed longer than that, but needless to say, I was very happy to leave this hotel. I understand that some guests might like this hotel b/c of the nice grounds, but to me service is important and the service at this property was just awful. One staff member told us that the staff does not work directly for Hilton but works for another company to which Hilton outsources. This might be the reason why the service is so bad. ", " We went into this hotel with rather low expectations because we had read several bad reviews and we do not expect a lot from a Hilton property. (What could we do, the Four Seasons books early!) However, this property is so poorly run that we could not help but laugh at the absurdity of most situations. We stayed at the hotel ten years ago and they have really let it go!! We tried to book a Presidential suite, but we were told they were booked, so we settled for a suite in the Palace Tower and a room across the hall for our nanny. The suite was moldy and threadbare with a peek a boo view of the ocean. All for several thousand per night! We quickly learned that it does not matter how much money you spend, who you are, etc. because nobody at the Hilton Waikoloa cares!! We periodically received cards and gifts from a \"VIP Manager\" named Chastity, but I do not know what she does all day because she never returned our phone calls or made any efforts at \"VIP\" service. And as for the general manager Dieter, he was at the Hawaii game in New Orleans....pretty bad for Christmas week which is traditionally one of the busiest times of the year! As for the rest of the staff, it ranged from pure indifference to a few who tried to do a good job, but were frustrated by bad management decisions. Overall, the staff was not very happy to be there.We started to question if the management was trying to lose money because there was so many poor decisions. For example, there were no drink servers by the pool! As the drinks were about $9 each, it would be an easy way for the property to generate profit. However, some genius decided it would be too difficult to employ a pool wait staff. Another poor decision was the arbitrary closing times of certain restaurants. The casual grill next to the Dolphin encounter closed exactly when the Dolphin encounter show ended! What???!! There were hundreds of people at 5:30 with their kids and the nearest bar and restaurant closes just as the show ends!! Hundreds of people were milling about looking for a place to spend their money, but they were turned away! The bartender at that restaurant told us it was a crazy decision from the \"people upstairs.\" We also learned it was necessary to bribe hostesses to obtain tables at the \"fine dining\" restaurants. We learned this after we waited an hour and a half for a seat at the Imari sushi bar. We ate there our first night and spent about $250 for two. We retuned the next night and were told a seat would be a \"few minutes.\" We watched the seats remain empty at the sushi bar. When we asked why we could not have the remaining seats we were told it was a \"service area.\" (They were actual seats, they service area was a few feet over....) The hostess told us she would check with the manager to see if we could sit in the open seats, but she never returned and we never saw a manager. After waiting for an hour at the bar, the bartender was buying us drinks and apologizing for the unacceptable treatment. Finally, at closing time (9:00), we were seated. We quickly scarfed down $200 worth of sushi and tipped the sushi chef $50. Unfortunately, for the sushi chef and wait staffs, they did not receive any big tips the next night because the same hostess tried to shake us down for a bribe to receive a seat at 9:00. (The restuarant was empty) We walked and bribed the hostess at the Italian place instead! (Seriously, we gave the hostess money for a seat in a empty restaurant. She told other parties around us they were \"completely booked.\") So if you want to eat at the Waikoloa, be prepared to pay a hostess!!As for the other fine dining restaurants, it was comical. Worst food of our lives and a weird robotic waiter who should have been at Denny's at 4am. The best food we had was at the casual Boat House. Great grilled sandwiches!!Also, the pool was freezing. Our children were shivering and it was really sad. Again, it did no good to complain because nobody cares!!! Also, the elevators are extremely dangerous because there was no sensor that stopped the door. Our nanny was almost chopped in half trying to save our toddler. We talked to others that almost had arms, legs chopped off as they left the elevator. We really started to dread the elevator experience each day!As for other amenities, we played golf and the boy \"in charge\" there engaged in a screaming match with several parties before they got to the first hole! We were so shaken that we did not calm down for about four holes. He was totally insane. He placed us with two men from Tokyo who were clearly upset that they were stuck playing golf with a woman. They also were very upset by his brusque behavior.I guess I could go on forever, but it really was a pit. And it really does not matter what I write because they really don't care at the Hilton Waikoloa. I guess I need to put my energy into securing a place at the Four Seasons. It does make me angry because a lot of people work hard to take a vacation in Hawaii and if they treated us so badly, I can't even imagine how bad it must be for people that can't bribe the employees. ", " Beware this hotel.It is a veritable disaster area. Nothing good about it. Imagining a poor weary traveller who chose this so called \"resort\" for his vacation, I decided to warn as many people about this terrible hotel.A Christmas construction Zone awaits and a never present manager (Dieter is probably on vacation at a Four Seasons). A call to front desk for bottled water gets you referred to a nearby SAFEWAY after 10pm which is when all the flights arrive, or room servic can deliver two 6oz bottles in under an hour, or perhaps you want to walk 1000 meters to the lobby where the ATM machine is empty and must be something like arriving at Ellis Island in 1913.I had reserved for two nights in a suite ($579 plus tax), and after my first night and upon awakening to the loudest construction noise, I called to the front desk and told them I was checking out early, hoping to be offered another suite, and was greeted with an \"OK\". I finished my business early and got the AA red eye at 1155pm back to LAX, and I am praying that some poor unsuspecting family don't get that room thinking they are in Kona for a fun vacation. At 8am expect the Lagoon Suite to begin trembling form the noises of MAJOR construction (see photos and be prepared to tremble). You shouldn't open the doors on your balcony either. Not at this RESORT(?)It is far too dusty and noisy. Perhaps Cleveland is a better idea.How can they call this a resort? A Village? It is like a prison without a warden. Stay away. I am Hilton Diamond member, so if this is the way they treat the 100 night a year blokes don't expect any fun with this management team at the helm. Save your family from this place now. DO NOT STAY HERE!! ", " First of all I would like to state I'm a Diamond Member and HGVC Owner, so I have stayed at many Hilton properties and enjoyed almost all of them; that said My review of the Waikoloa Village and my stay at this Hotel was surprising. I was Disappointed from beginning to end, here is my story. My wife and I spent a week at this resort and I have never been ready to leave Hawaii in the past. This resort changed that for me; by the end I was running for the car. I have stayed in Honolulu for years, my wife and I love the HHV in waikiki. I know some people think it's to busy and crowded or have had other problems, but we have enjoyed ever minute in Honolulu. I was very disappointed with Waikoloa, we arrived late Sat. on the 6th of Oct. dropped the bags off at the front desk while my wife checked in I drove back down the hill to self parking. The parking lot is spread out and is a long trek to the lobby as I have read and now found out for myself; we walked back and forth a lot in a week and my feet are still swollen and sore. We got to our room 4276 in the Palace Tower. The room was nice but my wife notice the floor was damp, thinking it was a carpet cleaning issue we went for a late bite and went to sleep shortly after we got back to the room that night. We woke up to a soggy floor from what turn-out to be a VERY LEAKY A/C unit.... My wife called and got little help from the front desk. At first they wanted to just do some work on it to try and fix it. We wanted to be moved the smell of a mildewy floor and squish, squish of the floor was not what I had in mind. So we waited all day for them to finally get us a different room. We had to call several times to finally get some help. This was not a good first day, because we did not get moved till after 3 pm. I think it tainted the whole trip and I will be writing Hilton an e-mail about that later. WE PAID THE BELL AGAIN TO MOVE OUR BAGS. We eneded up with a great room in the Ocean Tower 5072, but the day and the trip was spoiled with repacking and unpacking, paying the bell man twice to move bags. So we ended up walking even more because the tram did not run to the Ocean Tower the whole week we were at the hotel. So we either had to walk or ride the SLOW Boat around the resort. I know I'm on vacation but, still I would like to get around a little faster then 1 mile an hour. You can walk faster that the boat moved. Sometimes you had to wait 15 minutes for a boat. You could walk it twice as fast. I don't wear a watch on vacation so I drove my wife crazy about asking what time it was everytime we waited for a boat or walked to the Palace Tower to get on the tram. I have little time for SLOW or useless things and this waiting for a boat or waiting for a tram was TERRIBLE! The resort is 62 acres for goodness sakes have some better ways to get folks around this place will you. I'm in good health but you get tired of walking sometimes. I thought I was in NYC walking 30 city blocks every time we went some where. Next problem the room key seldom worked the parking lot gate, so I had to get the guard shack to let us out almost every time what a pain in the butt. One guard lectured me for 10 minutes about getting my room key fixed. My wife and I had them checked 3 time in the week we were at the hotel. I was so disappointed I gave up and my wife had to deal with them. I called the Diamond help line to tell them I was so unhappy with my stay. I have never called the Diamond help line before about a problem at a Hilton property.....I forgot to mention the BIRDS, Oh my! They were loud and every morning even if you did not want to wake up at 6 AM you had to because of the noise of them squaking.....!!!!!! Also the noise of carts on the hall way from the maids servicing the rooms out side the room were loud. The walls must be made of paper because you could hear other guests and slamming of doors down the hall and alarm clocks going off and showers coming on and shuting-off. The best part of the trip was spent away from the hotel driving the Island. Checking out the beaches and the history of the Island. We took a plane ride to see the Volcano, that was fun. we had grat seafood all over the island. We drove up to Hawi and ate at BAMBOO'S it was great. We ate near the resort too, at the Big Island Steakhouse it was very good. We ate at Merriman's at the King's Shop's as well, it was good but limited menu items. Kona is the place on the West side of the Island to be. It has many local places as well as some better known chain spots. Oceans was very good local place. we tried Kona Grill it was good too. There is a Bubba Gump's and an Outback Steakhouse. We tried an Italian place that was new and local it was great food the server was rattled with a big party but, the food was great...La TORSCO I believe was the name, but don't quote me on that. We spent only a couple of days at the hotel relaxing by the pool which was good and laying in a cabana reading. We ate twice at the hotel once, at the boat landing near the Ocean Tower. We order Pizza it was very good. We also had luch one day and sat near the Dolphin Quest area to watch the dolphins at the Lagoon Grill, the food was good. The cost of the food as so many others have written on this site about this place are true. Everything does cost a lot more here at the hotel but, you know that going in. We spent most of our time away from the property enjoying the Island itself. We check out a local place on Rt 19 on the North end of the island above Hilo called Tex Drive-In, it was good and reasonable, for just a snack don't expect fancy here. We even went to Waikoloa Village to the little grocery store. We ate at a place called Sharky's it a great palce to catch a game on the big screen and have a beer and some comfort food, shoot some pool while your waiting for your food. SO, in conclusion go to the Big Island enjoy the sights and sound all over the island but, beware of the Waikoloa Village and all the possible problem you may face. Some people can go and have a great time walking everywhere and not worring about how long it takes for a boat or the other things I mentioned. My wife and I meet a couple that were unfazed by it all, I made a comment there is nothing you can do at this place that would be considered fast, and that couple pass us and said that's a good thing. Everyone has likes and dislikes I guess, this place I must say I don't like very much at all. I love the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu though. As my wife has told me go with what you know and stay with what you love best. I will stay at HHV from now on when we go to Hawaii. I will never go back to Waikoloa Village again, I'm sorry it is not my cup of tea. ", " I got married at this hotel. The scenery on this resort is phenomenal but the service was in sharp contrast. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed and upset I was with the Wedding Atelier services that were \"provided\" by this hotel. To date, it has not yet been resolved. The florist could not provide decent leis for the parents---had to change my order three times and on the day I arrived, they informed me that they still couldn't find/create the leis that I wanted! Even the matron of honor's bouquet wasn't completed because they couldn't find ribbon to wrap the bouquet (it was suppose to match her dress). I provided that, too. Prior to that, the hotel could not offer my families a group rate on 11 rooms---they gave me the price that was listed on Expedia. I ended up booking them at the Marriott because they gave us rooms close to kamaaina rate. The wedding coordinator then promised us, the bride and groom, an upgraded room. When we arrived, no upgrade! When I inquired, the front desk had no clue about it. On the day of the wedding, the hotel offers the upgrade (I was in the midst of prepping for the wedding which was two hours away) and was in no position to move so I had to waive the upgrade. I requested that adjustments be made to the final invoice but to date, that hasn't occurred. Also, because the resort is so huge, guests usually ride the boats or the monorail to get from tower to tower. The monorail was out of order and this was a great inconvenience for the older family members. For such inadequate services, I couldn't believe I was charged full price. I attempted to speak to a general manager but was sent to several different managers in different departments. ", " Agree with the same disappointments of the more recent reviews, unfortunately. We did feel hostage here and mainly felt it wasn't a money, but value issue as we have had no problems dropping a fortune at the Four Seasons.My husband and I visited in September 2007 with our 2yr old daughter to end our 2 week stay in the islands. The grounds are fabulous, that is what is not being renovated. Overpriced food and a \"nickel and dime\" mentality were the start of a stay that never got any better. By the way, if you have young kids, try to get in the room first and hide the $17 stuffed dolphin toy they leave on the bed, our daughter saw it and for 2 days kept asking where it was.For our entire stay, the tram was closed for servicing, so was our boat landing at the Palace Tower so it was a convoluted walk to get to the nearest open boat landing. The boats that are the alternative to the tram were slower than walking and the canal stinks because of the algae growth. Construction screens for the tram work obstructed views. The walk from the front desk to our room took about 15 minutes. Noises of construction could be heard (jackhammers by the front pool, grinders and compressors along the rail line, paint fumes). Speaking of noises, we were woken up a couple of times by the boisterous security people who were walking up and down the hallways at night. They have their 2-way radios on and did not hesitate to converse loudly back and forth (3:30 a.m.! and 11:45 a.m.) The parking situation was absurd! The self parking lot costs $9 a day, valet was $17. The self park lot was always full while we were there (and September is supposed to be the \"off season\"!) and the self park lot is a long walk from the lobby ( as someone previously said - about 1/4 mile!) and you have to go through the valet lot to get to self parking, just to rub a little salt in the wound. Be prepared for a lot of walking from your room to the car. Mauna Lani offers free valet and self-parking.The food we got at the various grills was usually warm, not hot. The grill at the Ocean Tower provides overpriced (Think $8 for a \"hot dog\") , sub-par, bar-type food and the Nachos and Chili-dog we got were both cold and tasteless. We weren't the only ones grumbling about this. People freely complained as they were walking in that area. The grill by the Dolphin Pool was better - not great, just a better option as we couldn't leave for every meal. The lower cost ($20/person) breakfast buffet at the Ocean Tower only provides cereal, yogurt and pastries and a small sampling for fruit, it jumps to $30/person if you want meat or eggs. Not all the food is bad though, my wife and a friend's wife made it to the on-site Chinese restaurant for dinner and reported it was their first and only delicious meal there and the service was good. We didn't eat dinner as we thought we could at least have one good meal per day, Tommy Bahamas north on hwy 19 about 5 miles from the Hilton was excellent as well as the Canoe House at the Mauna Lani!If you go expecting to use the spas or other resources, make sure you call ahead to see if they'll be open when you're there. Most of the spa facilities were closed when my wife went for her spa treatment, so many of the treatments weren't even available. She ended up with a massage and facial (which was about all that was available), after she was looking forward to the all day spa experience. As well, she thought they were just average for the price - again value. She came from having an amazing spa experience on Maui.If you have someone in a wheelchair or take a stroller with you for your child, much of the resort's gounds will not be easily accessible to you. We had to carry our daughters stroller up and down, up and down, up and down many stairs as we walked around the grounds.I wouldn't recommend this resort to anyone, family or not, in its current state. It sounds like they don't take care of their guests during low season. We booked during high season when we saw all the rave reviews. Our bad luck I guess.We did complain to the management because of all the issues and they offered us a $200 credit, although we heard from others they had meals comped for similar type problems. Kapule, the asst. manager, provided the $200 credit after a lengthy conversation. When he asked if there was anything else he could do, I said that he could help by at least having a positive end to our stay and comping our meal we had reserved for at their Kamuela Provision Co. restaurant. He replied by saying that now I was trying to take advantage! Unbelievable...Needless to say, I left a message with the General Manager about our complaints and how I was taken back by Kapule's comment. The Sr. Hotel Manager, Marco Reynolds, called back. I voiced my frustration with the whole situation in general. He appeared thoughtful and concerned and wanting to do something more. He did say he thought the $200 credit was fair. However, he was going to see about crediting me some monies for the spa experience and said he would call back in 5 min.'s Well, so much for follow through - he hasn't called back. Additionally, there were other things that went wrong which added to the frustrating and disappointing experience, but I think I have written enough.The friends we were traveling with had the same experience and also came away disappointed, but again got a $200 credit. Something to compensate, but not adequate compensation for a disappointing weeks stay. Frankly, we were glad to leave and sad that this stay was how our vacation ended. Oh well. Side note: We received a few calls prior to arrival and no one ever mentioned - they will be renovating during your visit and X, y, z might be a problem or will be closed. Why did they bother calling? ", " We expected our stay to be the highlight of our trip. We lasted one night, then moved to the Marriott down the road (so glad we did as the Marriott was EXCELLENT!)We are a family of 4 with 2 school aged children and travel to beach resorts mostly in the Carribean about once a year and are seasoned travelers.Everything you read about this place is accurate - it is huge, but very impersonal. We simply did not feel like were were at a beach destination in Hawaii - this resort could have been anywhere. This resort engulfs you and I overheard someone say it best - you felt almost captive. We were going to try and stick it out for the 5 nights until I awoke at 5:30 am by the sound of thousands of birds in the trees outside our room. If you want a beach vacation don't stay here. Stay elsewhere and stop by. Take the boat ride or monorail ride, check out the gigantic pool with thousands of people. If you do stay here - it really is 20 minutes to get to your car. The boats do come frequently, but they are very slow. It is a bit disconcerting to be so far from your car or the resort exit.The service was typical for a huge place. Although the line to check in was short, there was none of the personal touch one likes to see on vacation. Good luck if you do say here! ", " I agree with doc's review entirely (except for the roaches - only in that we didn't see any - thank God!).First, my family and I wanted to visit the Big Island, then Kauai on our trip to Hawaii (three nights on the Big Island, four nights on Kauai). I discovered that this Hilton was once a Hyatt, which gave me a false sense of satisfaction. Frankly, this Hilton property sucks!To qualify my hotel standard, I usually stay at Hyatts and Westins with an occasional Marriott stay and Ritz Carlton from time to time for special events. I stay at Hilton properties rarely, but travel to our home office regularly and stay at Embassy Suites when doing so. Over a five-year period of doing so, I built up enough Honors points for a \"free\" stay at this Hilton on the Big Island. Let me just say that I feel robbed even with using my points for this stay.The room? Very dated. What's worse is that I asked the valet about the different rooms in the different towers (we were in the Ocean Tower). He indicated that the rooms were \"updated\" not too long ago (?).The food? Bad! Bad! Bad! The quality of the food is poor and absolutely over-priced. Beware the Lagoon Grill where soft drinks are $3.91 each. My family of four with each of us having two soft drinks with our meal spent right at $32.00 for the Cokes alone. There are no drinks or prices listed on the menu and nothing to tell you that you pay by the drink (which isn't the case at other restaurants on the property as we later found out).At the Palm Terrace Restaurant (I believe it's called) located in the Ocean Tower, we had breakfast one morning. Oh, my God, the birds in this place were horrible. The hostess sat us at a table where I noticed walking up that two birds were sitting on the table - one on the utensils. We moved to another table, but I'm sure the birds had visited that table as well. The birds will fly around and land at your table while you are sitting there, as though they are entitled to join you for breakfast. The doors of this place can be closed, but are wide open. The waiters also bus the tables, which is part of the problem. Once guests leave, the food sits and birds swarm in large numbers to clean up. Gross - especially considering that the breakfast buffet is right at $30.00/person.For that matter, the food in this place is overpriced. I have been to Hawaii before and expect to pay more than I would at home, but this feels more like rape.And, finally, doc nailed it when he mentioned the lack of customer service here. These people don't give a you know what. They could care less that you are satisfied as a paying customer. It's almost as if they laugh at you for being dumb enough to pay these prices in the first place.Bottom line - I probably will never return to the Big Island again. Kauai is the island for us (and the Hyatt there for years has been the standard by which all other resorts have been judged). Not sure why Hyatt quit managing this property many years ago, but my guess is that the decline of this location can be linked with the decision to switch to Hilton management from Hyatt way back when.Do yourself a favor - if you do go to the Big Island, spend the extra bucks and treat yourself to the new Four Seasons property. You won't feel compelled after the fact as I have to get on here and warn people about that property.Aloha. ", " My goodness, I am writing to Hilton to get my money back. 6,000 for 5 nights, I just don't understand. Actually, I think I do understand. The staff appear to completely ignore and dare I say, hate the tourists that come and stay at the hotel and pay the fees that put the checks in their pockets to feed their families. The hote rooms are dirty, musty, moldy and roach ridden. I was moved between 3 of them.....I was \"upgraded\" to the ocean tower for my troubles...I got upgraded to smaller roaches in my room. The food prices were so out of control and the food was really bad. I was astonished and angered to think I could have eaten at the Four Seasons up the road for less money!!!!! There was a horrible smell coming of the body of water that circulates around the property. It obviously doesn't get circulated enough and it made eating in the cafe, which abutts the lagoon, impossible due to the smell.I think this hotels problems arise from management not caring or possible being offsite and not having hands-on time with the staff, beacuse they let them get away with alot of poor customer service techniques that would get them fired in any other hotel. Stay away from this overpriced, poorly run hotel. ", " We always dreamed of going to Hawaii and this year we were able to do so. For years I held a postcard of the Hilton Waikoloa Village and the Web site looked terrific. We originally booked for 8 days but decided to spend 3 days in Honolulu which was wonderful--we stayed at the Sheraton Princess. When we got to the Waikoloa resort we discovered it was a huge resort in the middle of no where, which was acceptable because it is like a self-contained city where all your needs should be met. It was absolutely breathtaking.Our 1st disappointment came when we found out resort was under renovations--something they failed to let us know when we revised our reservation.. The main problem beig that the Tram from the reception area was not running and we had to hike quite a distance to the next stop. My husband has no cartilage in his right knee and cannot keep walking long distances. I had a mobility cart (fold and go) but it did not fit on the Tram's ramp. The ramp was designed for wheelchairs and my tires were too close together, so he and the Tram operatior had to lift it up. Our ocean front room was changed to a closer one but it really made no difference because they only have the elevators at the ends where the Tram stops, so to do the wash, he had to take our elevator down and hike over to the second elevator as ours did not go down tot he basement . Then he had to hike back towards our room because that was where the laundry room was. They only had 6 units for the entire 3 circles of rooms (see their layout), so he had to spend 3 hours there.  I then ordered room service because we got in late. When it came, we got a soggy pizza, 2 12 oz cokes, bowl of soup and a turkey club for $70. We still can't figure that out because the most expensive thing was $13.00. The food was of poor quality--soggy pizza, a turkey club consistig of 3 ieces of turkey, mayo, lettuce & tomato slices. It was the size of a small piece of rye bread. The soup looked made up. It was suppose to be chicken noodle, but looked like won ton with added other chinese noodles and tasted like beef boullion cubes. Also, the public bathrooms may look handicap compliant, but they are not. The doors open in, so a person in a wheel chair will have to do their business with the door open for all to see. Luckily I can walk short distances with a kane because I had to park my cart out side the bathroom. If I took my cart in, no one would be able to get in as it would block the door.The next day we went to Kaila-Kona's town cener and booked in to a very lovely hotel directly on teh beach where we could hear the surf crashing on the rockes..Our holiday was saved and we enjoyed the rest of our stay there. ", " The Hotel had a number of issues during my stay that resulted in a less than satisfactory experiance. Specifically they seemed in the middle of a remodel of the tram and coffee shop and some retail outlets that made the experiance not pleasurable.They took the only coffee shop out of service after my first nite with no notice. Went down to get a cup of coffee and a roll and it just never opened. No sign, no nothing. They boarded it up eventually.The tram remodel means you are either waiting for a boat forever or doing some serious walking.My major complaint was the dive shop operation which I confirmed would be open and when I got there it was closed so the boat could be rebuilt. It was 30 miles back to Kona to an open for business dive shop.The service was uneven and some areas were clearly not well staffed. One could spend a fair amount of time either in line or waiting in the lounges etc.I actually registered my complaint with the manager but other than a sorry and a chocolate dolphin they sent up I was essentially out of luck.I will try the Marroitt or Four Seasons next time. ", " I\u2019d like to take a moment to [--] about the Hilton Waikoloa and to offer a tip or two. We were staying elsewhere, but we\u2019d heard about the Kohala Spa and decided to see if we could get a couples massage. There is no signage, so we inquired as to the whereabouts of the spa at the gate. \u201cIt\u2019s off the hotel lobby, come in, come in and just park anywhere in the self-park lot\u201d we were told. Little did we realize that we\u2019d just ransomed our car for the greater of a $50 purchase or $9.50 parking tab FOR ANY DURATION OF TIME. Do NOT do this. Instead, park in the shoreline public access lot across the street from the gate for free and walk over to the hotel. We wandered around the Disneyworld-esque common areas, complete with monorail and canal boat transportation, perusing the mostly unremarkable Asian antiquities until we found the spa. Unfortunately, it was booked up for the day however. While we could well afford the services, once we looked over the prices ($140 each for 50 minutes) we felt that there were much better values elsewhere. If you\u2019ve got your heart set on this spa in any event, prepare to pay a very premium price for any of their extensive services and be sure to make reservations well in advance.Before we learned that it took $50 in purchases to get back out, we had lattes at Kimos Espresso in the hotel, which at $4.50 per each rated as close to the worst bitter drinks we have ever had. This was followed by a marginally adequate breakfast of macadamia nut French toast, which was served with a remarkable lack of enthusiasm or interest. In fact, lack of enthusiasm and interest seemed to be the hallmark of almost every employee we encountered.We pity those poor people who think that the Hilton Waikoloa represents the ultimate in service and quality. We perceived it from outside of this illusion and see it as an elaborate means of ripping-off wealthy tourists who just don\u2019t know any better.By contrast, Trip Advisor has honest and highly dependable reports of many other places to stay in Kona, which represent good to stellar values. Our personal favorite has to be the Horizon Guest House, which might seem pricey at $250/night but isa far better experience at one quarter (1/4!) the price some people are paying to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. If Hilton was smart, they\u2019d hire innkeeper Clem Classen to revamp their entire operation before the truth about them spreads.operation. ", " The resort boasts the highest restaurant prices that I have ever seen. Don't even think of ordering half a papaya via room service - it costs 9,50$. Internet service is 16$ a day. The layout of the property is such that leaving it is a big problem. Getting down from your room takes 5 minutes, waiting for the train or boat another 10 minutes, taking the trip on the train/boat takes another 5 minutes, and walking to the overpriced parking lot takes another 5 minutes. Also, the resort is located as far as possible from any Big Island attractions, except for the overpriced helicopter tours which are so much cheaper from Hilo. Guests seem to be imprisoned in this property, but if your goal is not to visit Hawaii but simply to swim in a pool and pay 80 for one meal per person then the place will serve you well. ", " As the \"#1 TOP FAMILY RESORT IN HAWAII\" we were really looking forward to staying here. I'd love to love this property but with all the problems we had it was a very mixed experience.The problems started when we arrived and ended even worse. What we didn't know was that the main pool, which was the reason we brought the kids to the hotel, was shut down for two of the four days of our stay. We should have been notified of this during our reservation which was only two days prior to our stay. This is unacceptable.The property is so large that walking from our room at one end to the restaurant at the other is a 15 minute march. Thankfully the property provides both a monorail service and canal boat service. Unfortunately, the monorail track on half the property was under construction. Worse yet, one of the monorails broke down during our visit so the wait times were overly long. Thankfully there was the boat service as a backup -- too bad they only had two of about ten boats running most of the time. Standing around a resort waiting for transportation is never a fun way to spend your vacation.During our stay we ate at three of the restaurants on the property. Here are reviews of each:The Kamuela Provision Company has an incredible view, menu and service. I can't thank the manager \"Lance\" enough -- the guy is awesome and took VERY good care of us.Donatoni's Italian restaurant was a FANTASTIC experience with a very romantic ambiance, excellent service and top notch food. Our server \"Cornelius\" really made the evening.And then there's Imari, home of the worst New York Steak I've ever had, the most boring Teppanyaki presentation I've ever seen, and the best place to find food poisoning in the resort. Yes, it really was that bad and at $50/head you'd think they'd do better. Pathetic. No, I didn't bother complaining -- when it's that bad you figure the manager is either clueless or knows of the problems and chooses to ignore them.So how do you rate a property like this? I'm REALLY easy-going so I chose not to cause a fuss over the construction, broken-down transportation, etc. so that my kids would overlook the problems as well. As the guy paying the $2,000 bill for three nights -- I'm more than a little disappointed -- I've been ripped-off by Hilton as they knew of the construction issues but chose not to tell us. Buyer-Beware -- Hilton promises much, delivers little and once you're at the resort, what are you going to do about it? You have no choice but to move hotels and it's too late for that.I really wanted to love this property -- Hilton made that impossible. ", " i stayed at the four seasons hualalai and am having my weddign there, but wanted to check out nearby hotels for guests attending my wedding. We found the Hilton Waikoloa awful, the hotel is extremely old, very ugly, and service is pathetic. The themes are also very cheesy, the walkways aare very dark and i hated waiting for the monorail. Rooms are over US$300 bucks, they are old, ugly and the bathrooms are very crummy as well. What bothered me the most was that you spent lots of time waiting for the train, and if you didn't want to, you'd walk like 7-10 mins to get to the lobby.Restaurants were awful, we ate at Imari and the food tasted nasty and was very expensive. The chicken terriyaki for ex was like 40 bucks and was very hard and not tender.Pools were ugly, most were being renovated, and no activity items are included with the rooms. You have to pay for the kayaks, bicycle boats, and lounge chairs. Worst hotel I stayed at in my 2 weeks in Hawaii. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE> Yes they have a dolphin area, but you can just visit that without staying.Check out the Marriott next door which is brand new, just renovated, and much more modern. My guests will be staying there for our wedding if they do not want the four seasons. ", " We stayed at this resort 2 weeks ago after receiving an offer from their 'vacations club'. The resort is a bit far, so you will need a car without exceptions. At arrival time their 'valet' personnel immediately instruct you to go park, without letting you check in, unless you want to give them your car keys and pay the $16 plus tip, BTW parking yourself is $9/day!. This has been the only place in the world that I have ever experienced that. The valet employees must be paid very poorly since the are the rudest people we have encountered in the Island.Make sure you are ready to be nickeled and dimed, water is $4.50 for a small bottle. Breakfasts are mediocre at best and they will set you back $15 per person (rubber eggs, burn hash browns, no toast unless you pay for the extras). We constantly saw people bringing groceries from outside. The only worth while and enjoyable (very expensive, about $60 per person) dinning is their Italian restaurant, Donatori's. The facilities are absolutely beautiful (the large pool is under construction and another resort being constructed towards the back) and it seems there is always a chain saw running. Be prepared to walk a lot, distances are ridiculous between the parking lot/reception and your room. If you have reserved anything outside the resort give yourself at least 20 mins to get to your car. Yes, they have a 'train' and a 'boat' however, it seems they are always going the opposite way from where you'd like to go.Day management is unresponsive if you ever need anything. If you can catch the night manager, she is much better. The rest of the hotel personnel need serious training on Customer Service.If you have kids and want to be corraled in this resort (and have a huge wallet), then this is the place for you; however, if you are trying to have a nice romantic time, are retired or don't have kids with you, I would avoid the Hilton Waikoloa Village at all costs. My boyfriend gave me a short trip and it was supposed to be a relaxing time, but they managed to ruin our vacation (management, resort salespeople and valets) and my first time visiting Hawaii. We will never go back there again and will advise our friends the same. ", " I was brutally attacked at the Dolphin Quest Encounter at the resort. The resort and Dolphin Quest has refused payment of $20,000 in medical expenses incurred as a result of their error. They were experimenting by putting a new mother Pele and her baby dolphin in together in the encounter. If the dolphin attacked my child, they would not have lived. I was in surgery and physical therapy and affected for over a year. They have done nothing to reimburse or stand by their error. ", " Some reviews are much more difficult to write, and this hotel has me completely at loss for words. I think what makes this hotel fall so short is it's location. If it were placed in a city that didn't have a lot to offer, it may be easier to give it higher reviews. However, to travel here and stay at such an incredible place as the Big Island in Hawaii, this resort clearly does nothing to blend into the rugged, breathtaking beauty of the Big Island.When we pulled up in our humble extended mini van from the rental car place, the valet service actually called our car a \"[--] van\". My children heard it plane as day. \"Mom! Did you hear what he said?\" I was shocked.We were then greeted by the gross site of a large tram that runs constantly throughout the resort. It would not be attractive anywhere. I don't work for Disney, but I'm sure they would not have it, and neither would Chicago. The tram goes one way, so, there are two trams running in opposite directions. What a mess this makes for walking around the resort. It passes by the little rivers and ponds which are in need of a complete cleaning.We ate at the italian resturant and I cannot remember the name. But I do remember sitting in overstuffed chairs, with a table so big that my children's chins could rest on the table. The entire resturant reminded us of some creepy halloween haunted house, we felt like we must be on candid camera. The staff was sooo stuffy, and yet it was written up as a great family place. Surely this must be a joke of some kind?I really don't mean to offend anyone, and I think you should be able to enjoy anywhere you go if you have the right perspective. I know that no place is perfect, and some people might be looking for something other than a quiet beach resort. However, if you are like me and your house is surrounded by Hawaii travel books and your family is saving all you can to visit this beautiful island, in my opinion, this would be one place you could avoid staying at, and if you want, come and visit during the day. ", " Where do I begin, Whoever said this is a Disneyland is wrong. At Disneyland they are friendly and clean. We arrived @ the Hilton on Sept. 25 we had reserved an ocean front room for 325.00. The rude girl at the front desk, said there was not direct ocean available she would give us a discount for partial ocean view. When we asked what the view was like her response was,\"sir ther are 1200 rooms here I have not been in every room\" \"maybe I am making this to complicated for you\" I think she was way out of line. Anyway we went to the filthy room, which smelled of must and stale water, and called the Mani lani down the street. A five star hotel, could not have been more accomodating. For 25.00 dollars more a night we went there, talk about paradise. Think twice before going to that flea bag HILTON motel!!!!!!! ", " It was amazing how uncaring the staff was. I felt like it was such a slap in the face to be paying such incredibly high prices for food and drink and to have staff not even look you in the eye. I was stunned after a woman at the front desk asked me what my other problem with the hotel were after I had one very small complaint. I feel stupid for holding my tongue while I was there. Also, the \"locals\" were there over the weekend for a craft fair , which made for some loud, obnoxious times in public areas. let's say that the beer cooler locals were not of the same class as the guests that had been there all weekend. I was happy to leave when I did, and had i not prepaid I would have left and gone to the four seasons or the mauna kea property.  I warn you again..only come here if you want horrid service, VERY overpriced food and beverage (GOD...the FOUR SEASONS BRUNCH WHICH IS EXQUISITE FOR THE SAME PRICE FOR GODSAKES) ", " We just returned from a 3 week vacation in Hawaii. We started on Oahu, then Maui and then the Big Island. We stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Waikoloa and it was the must disappointing 4 nights of the whole trip. We had high expectations of this hotel (we expected it to be the best) and it was our biggest regret of the trip.Our first night we decided to take the tram and then the boat around the complex just to see where everything was located and to get ourselves familar with the grounds. That was the only time we used this transportation. it was faster to walk the 20 - 30 minute hike than to take the transportation. We stayed in the Ocean Tower and to get to the Kona pool, the lobby and god forbid the parking lot, it was a 20-30 minuted ordeal. 30 minutes to get to your car and they still charge you $7 for parking per day.Our first trip to the Kona pool which our children thought was the \"coolest pool\" we walked our 20 minutes to get there and asked for towels and we were told that they were out of towels. I then asked when I should check back to get towels and was told that they wouldn't be getting any more that evening. This was at 7:00 pm and the pool didn't close until 11:00 pm. I guess if you want to walk 20 minutes back to your room dripping wet that would be acceptable. But since that didn't sound appealing to us, I tried a third time with the ever so rude employee by asking what exactly did she need to do to get us some towels since the guest service seem to be lacking from her respnoses. Her response was \"you will just have to go back to your room to get towels there is nothing I can do for you.\" I'm sorry but a 40 minute round trip walk for towels was not the answer I was looking for. It gets more ridiculous....read on.After that encounter we decided to just return to our room for the evening get some rest and the next day had to be a better experience. On the way back to our room we saw an ice cream counter and the base of our ocean tower and so we thought we would get some ice cream since we didn't get to go swimming. So we started to order from the list of 10 flavors to find out they only had two flavors in stock neither of which sounded good, probably why they were the only two flavors left. The girl working the counter said they had a shipment coming in on Tueday if we wanted to come back then for an ice cream (it was Saturday when we inquired) or if we wanted to walk over the Lagoon Tower that there was an ice cream counter over there. The poor girl had no idea we had just walked our 40 minute round trip to and from the Lagoon Tower to attempt going swimming and that we weren't about to walk back to get an ice cream. Because with the way our evening was going we were pretty sure that the Lagoon Tower ice cream counter would probably be out of ice cream as well. Just a guess...starting to see a pattern. Read on .After a good night sleep until the birds woke me at sunrise. Ok I know this sounds funny. I read this on another review. But if you are staying in the Ocean Tower. The birds in the courtyard outside our room (our room #was 6029) go absolutely crazy at sunset and sunrise. I laugh at this one, it seems minor, I don't mind getting up early but if you plan on sleeping in, it won't happen in this room unlesss you bring ear plugs. Anyway after sleeping on our experiences of the night before I decided to start my day with a new attitude, the eveing before must have just been a fluke or maybe I just reading too much into the evening. So we decided to go back to the Kona pool for the day, I burn rather easily so my husband and I found chairs under the waterfall where is was shaded right next to the little walkway bridge in the waterfall. There were kids jumping off this bridge into the pool most of the day while we were sitting there and our 9 year old asked us if he could jump off of it too. We told him no because we didn't think that is was something that was allowed, it was our first time to the pool so we were going under our own assumption. After a couple hours of watching child after child (oh yeah and some adults too) our 9 year thought he would try us again and asked us if he could jump off the bridge. Considering we had been watching people jump off it all day we told him we thouhgt it would be alright. Each time he jumped he asked us to watch and see if anyone was swmimming under the bridge before he jumped, so we would tell him when it was ok to jump or if he needed to wait until the people under the bridge cleared before he jumped. After awhile the RUDEST employee we encountered at the Hilton( I will refrain from putting her name in this post to follow the post guidelines but I will be naming her by name in my written complaint to the Hilton) told our son that he wasn't allowed to jump off the bridge. So we said our first instinct was correct so he stopped jumping off the bridge and we continued to try to enjoy our day and swim at the pool. We had been at the pool for a couple of hours and our son went to turn in his wet towel for a dry towel and THAT LADY ( I will refer to the obnoxious employee as THAT LADY because I would not be following the guidelines of this post if I referred to her the way she behaved) decided to yell and lecture my son some more about jumping off the bridge. My son came back and told us about the conversation but none of us could figure out why she was continuing to badger him because he hadn't jumped off the bridge anymore after she had asked him not to, even though we had continued to sit there and watch every other kid in that pool jump off of it. So I decided to go over and talk to THAT LADY to find out why she had decided to single out my child to be the ONLY child she spoke to and why she continued to badger him. She told me that someone had complained about him jumping on their leg. I told her that that was entirely untrue because we had watched every jump he made. She wan't interested in my side of the story whatsoever, she believed what the first guest had told her and that was that. So I suggested to her to stay over by the bridge so that she could tell everyone else jumping off the bridge that is was not allowed becuase if wasn't fair that my child was the only the person in the pool that day that wasn't allowed to jump off the bridge and she told me that she didn't have the time to do that. So at this point I told her that she didn't need to tell my son anymore, he hadn't jumped off the bridge anymore and he continuing badgering was unneccessay. So much for starting fresh with a new day...I really did try.The next day we decided to check out the Big Island so we didn't spend much time at the resort that day. I think we needed some time away as much as we wanted to explore the island. Best day there!! The next and final day at the Hilton we went back to the Kona pool and we sat at in a different area so that we didn't have to watch everyone except our children jumping off the bridge. We were having a enjoyable day at the pool and we decided to go on the water slide and ran into THAT LADY again. We stood in line for about 10 minutes and THAT LADY didn't talk to anyone in line in front of us other to say to them that it was ok to slide. Until my 9 year old got the front of the line and you guessed it she started in on him again. She started lecturing him on pool rules AGAIN, ok now I have gone from you are ruining my vacation to I better go get my blood pressure checked. I just couldn't believe that 2 days later and he had not done anything wrong since the first conversation with her and she was going to start harassing him again. This now was just down right harassment. After a heated conversation between THAT LADY and myself we decided to formally complain about THAT LADY, we had had enough. My 9 year old is now crying, my blood pressure is sky high (and I don't have blood pressure problems) so my husband decides to make the complaint. In his conversation with THAT LADY's supervisor he does find out that the employess at the pool do not work for the Hilton, they work for another company hired by the Hilton. Just a suggestion, maybe it's time for a change. Thank goddess it is the last day at this place. I can't believe we have paid this kind of money to be harassed.I stopped at the front desk to get some stamps to mail the post cards I had written that day. Of course, that were out. Suprised? you shouldn't be.Oh I almost forgot, we decided to go back to the Ice Cream shop that evening because it was Tuesday and there were getting there shipment in today. You guessed it, already out of the flavor we wanted. Just for laughs, (at this point it is getting comical to us), I asked the fellow working the counter if they got their shipment in today and he said they did but they were already out of that ice cream.After leaving the Hitlon we drive to the Hilo side of the island and check into the Hilo Hawaiian Hotel for one night. That one night was 10 times better than the four nights at the Hilton Waikoloa Village. Our 5 nights at the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach on Oahu was great and our favorite 5 nights of the trip was at The Embassy Vacation Resort on Maui, I suggest that the Hilton take some pointers from them. Such as the free parking and a 2 minute walk from the parking garage to your room (at the Hilton you will pay $7 and walk for 30 minutes). Also the Embassy employees are supberb, maybe the Hilton could send their employess to the Embassy for training. What a difference!!!!If you haven't figured out, I will NEVER stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village again. I will NEVER suggest that anyone I know stay there and if I were you I would look elsewhere. If you do decide to stay, a couple of suggestions. You can ask for a refrigerator to be sent to your room that isn't fully stocked. It wasn't exceptionally cold, so be careful with that. If you are staying the Ocean Tower, stop by the Adult poolon your way to the Kona pool to get your towels and wrist bands and you won't have stand in the long lines at the Kona pool for them. We drove to Kona for dinner everyday, it was worth the drive. We paid a third of what we would have paid at the Hitton for dinner. We went grocery shopping in Kona ate breakfast and lunch in each day. After seeing that the Hilton wanted $37 for their breakfast buffet. I'm sorry but I don't know anyone that could even eat $37 worth of breakfast so eating cereal from the grocery store was fine with us each morning. I do have two compliments for the Hilton, we were able to check in early to our room upon arrival and the give you four pillows on a king sizie bed instead of the standard 3. That's it, I try to look at the positive in every situation and that is all I could come up with time. Better than nothing I guess, but not enough to out weigh the negative.The Hilton has a beautiful grounds but I think the complex is too big for them to manage. They really really need to work on their customer service skills. ", " I want to share my experience because I found that I was not the only one who shared these same viewpoints about this property. The service at the Hilton Waikaloa is the worse I have EVER experienced. The staff are rude and lazy. I went to order lunch at the lagoon poolside restaurant and the worker came to the counter of the bar and said, \"what do you want?\"..and the staff at the pool- where I went to purchase swim diapers were equally as rude and unhelpful- that encounter with the staff member got me so upset I was telling my husband about it and other guests listening to me, interupted in agreement-and shared their stories.The only nice thing I have to say about this hotel is the property is beautiful, other than that, I would not spend money for serive that was unacceptable. ", " I am a frequent Hilton patron, and use them for most of my business travel. This one takes the cake for worst service, and worst value. After paying a very high rate (it was $400 a night for an unremarkable room with a garden-view, and a rental car) we were nickel-and-dimed to death. Here is an example - they wanted to charge us $4 for delivery of a knife and corkscrew to our room because it had to come from the Ocean Tower to our Palace Tower, next door. Restaurants are the most expensive on the island. The tv movies didn't work, outlets in the wall didn't work, one night we got turndown service, next night none. Most of the employees here were extremely rude, as if asking for something (like ordering a coffee at the coffee shop) was putting them out.Be aware also - there is NO BEACH HERE. This is an expensive place to stay to hang around a pool.The Disneyland-esque element of boats on tracks and a rail around the complex would be fine make believe for Las Vegas or Arizona. . .but not for a place like Hawai'i where the natural elements are so outstanding. There are a lot of activities available, but these are extra and can be done by non-hotel guests. ", " We stayed at this hotel just recently February 13th through February 18th. This is my fourth trip to Hawaii so this was not my first trip to a large resort/hotel but it will be my last to a Hilton owned hotel. First off the hotel does not provide a single shuttle from the airport so make sure you absolutely rent a car. It is a 50.00 taxi ride. Also if you decide to rent a car from the Budget inside the hotel, book it way ahead of time. They did not have a single car to rent the whole week we were there so we had to pay for two 50.00 taxi rides. You are going to get a major work out walking from your room to ANYWHERE!! It was a hike just to get ice for our room. When we first arrived we had to carry all of our luggage to the room since it was a 2 hr wait for them to bring it up, then to top it off when we finally arrived at our room with the 6 pieces of luggage we carried neither of our keys worked. This hotel is huge and beautiful I want to add but next time I would want something a little smaller. Next up valet lost our car and nobody knew where it was. We had to call down to valet multiple times and everytime the same exact girl made me explain the same story every single time. Then the parking lot was constantly full so we were forced to pay valet. Eventually we complained to the right person and were comped. ( By the right person I mean they gave us the run around over and over for a manager). BEWARE the coffee is not free. They fail to mention that they charge 6.00 a day for your coffee so imagine my surprise when I received a 30.00 bill! I have stayed at many hotels and I have never paid for coffee! If you want to go to The Kings Shops the hotel has a complimentary shuttle that is suppose to run every 10 minutes. It sure DOESN'T especially during dinner time. We would wait sometimes up to 30 minutes in fact one day we got fed up and walked.(I felt the hotel does this on purpose to get you to eat dinner at the hotel) On a side note I must add if you have a car take the 30 minute drive to Walmart and Kmart to stock up on snacks and treats. The Whalers General Store in Kings Shop is 5.00 more for everything and after awhile it starts to add up. Very last but absolutely not least The Hilton's customer service.....Awful everytime we tried to eat in that hotel there was never a clean table so we would have to sit at a dirty one and hope someone would come our way to clean it. Once you received your food you never saw them again. I expected alot more since sometimes I would pay up to 30.00 for just breakfast. Asking your waitress to smile was like pulling teeth. During the time we were there I did realize that they had multiple conventions going on, it was Valentine's day, etc, but I feel as a paying customer (especially when you pay this much) they need to make absolute sure they have enough staff members at the times when they know they will be busy. This is not a new hotel and they should know by now how to operate it! For a first time visit to the most beautiful island of Hawaii (hands down) Please do not waste your money here. You do not get what you pay for. If you do choose to ignore my warning make sure you ask how many conventions they are having while you are there and how big. Don't forget to get a rental car at the airport and do not miss Hapuna Beach! ", " the Hilton Waikoloa at Kauai(? I forget how it suppose to spell). It is supposed 5 stars hotel, but we just did not feel the service up to it. First of all, we had to wait about 45 mins in line to check in. Then the Japanese receptionist just couldn't handle our registration (as we have parties of 5 families). He was all confused. It took about another 45 mins to have get our rooms. I have to admit that the Rooms were very very nice, the Beds was perfect. So we thought that the waiting was worth it. Then we immediately without wasting time, rush to the pool and the kids had reserved the Dolphin Quest event. It was good. Then it was about 5 p.m, so all of us kind of relax at the poolside, unfortunately, there was a lady came by said that the Pool closed and we had to leave at once. So we leaving the pool area and went a little bit further enjoying the breeze and the remaining sun.. we saw a few people went into the pool and sit there (same as what we did), without chasing away by the staff.My sister went and asked why they can sit there, but we can't. The staff gave a dirty look. There were other events also giving us the feeling of \"discrimination\" definitely. As all the people that treated well was non-asian, let's put it that way.Well, we had put these all behind us, and decided that we will never never never go back to the Hilton.I hate it, hate it, hate it. ", " Started our Hawaii trip early June with the Kahala Mandarin on Oahu, then on to Marriott Beach Club Kauai then Hapuna Beach Prince on the Big Island. All very enjoyable experiences. Then the nightmare started with the Hilton.*First we had booked and paid for 2 double beds. At 11.00 pm when we unfolded the sofa bed our 2 children were to sleep on, we discovered it was a single. On contacting the front desk, after some stonewalling they finally offered us the room we had reserved and paid for: twin doubles. But it was up to us to move our luggage. Anyone who knows the distances at this hotel would realize what really, really, poor service this was. We were not offered any assistance to cover their mistake, or even an apology.*They nickel and dime you. The Hilton was the only hotel we stayed at that charged you to use the in-room safe ($4per day) or the Fitness Center ($11 per visit) or the coffee that comes with the coffee maker ($3.25 per cup).*The rooms were definitley 3 star and no higher. There was no room to put your own beverages into the room fridge and there was a warning that only the Hilton was licensed to serve alcohol at the hotel.*The last straw came at breakfast. We went to the buffet breakfast @ $24 per head for adults, half for children. My daughter wanted a malasada. I went to the bench where they were and saw birds perched on the malasadas and the condiments (like sprinkles etc). The birds were eating away. I pointed this out to a staff member, who gave them a quick shoo and continued walking, leaving it to the next unsuspecting guest to select a partially eaten malasada or other breakfast item. I won't go into all the details but this staff attitude was absolutely typical of our stay and completely different from all the other places during our vacation in Hawaii. By the way, we found the qualilty of the breakfast very poor. We couldn't eat it.*We couldn't take any more. We checked out early ($50 penalty). The front desk clerk noted we were checking out early, but didn't ask why, or even if everything had been okay, which I also thought said a lot about the morale of the staff and the training they had received.*The truth is I would have paid more to get out. It was just awful. ", " My husband and two teenage boys arrived Friday afternoon (Good Friday) around 2:30pm. The valet greeted us and sent us inside to register. The line was out the door to register and only TWO people were working the front desk. Once register we were given a map and told what building our room was in and to catch the tram. Once we finally got the tram (another 20-30 minutes later) no one could tell us where are room us in the building. The standard answer was I THINK IT IS OVER THERE!The room was ok. It was too small for four people. After settling in we asked about where to go get some food and no one once again could help us. Now the trams are down and boats are having problems. So its a 1/2 mile walk up to a rest. to get some food. The service was terrbile there and the bill for the four of us was $85.00 and that included only three salads and one blt sandwich no drinks except water.Went back to the room to freshen up and the tub wouldn't drain. After the first night and then trying to get service the next morning we call the Hilton at the Hawaiian Village Honolulu to fly over and stay there if available as service was going down hill.Unfortuntly no luck in going over. The trams and the boats the rest of the week worked off and on and most times you had to walk the resort which peolpe with handicaps or small kids were having a terrible time getting around. The management staff was just as bad. We will never go back to the Hilton there again. We did however find some resorts just as nice on the island and spoke with many other people and they had also had the same experience and that is why they were staying at these other resorts. ", " This hotel has the worst service I have ever experienced. My wife and I were traveling from Kauai to The Big Island on our honeymoon in October. We had been staying at the Princeville Hotel which I highly recommend. From the moment we arrived at the hotel the service was bad. The valets met us but were not pleasant. When we walked into the hotel, there was one man working the front desk and it took him a little while to even look up at us. When he did look up he was rude, and he did not make us feel welcome in any way, rather just took our information and told us where we were going. When we got to the room, it reaked of smoke. We had requested a non-smoking room, so I called down to the front desk to explain this and told them we would like another room, the first thing they said to me was that requesting a non-smoking room was just that, a request, but they would see what they could do. I asked what we should while we were waiting, and was told I could check out the propert but if we left and missed the call to change rooms we might not get it! So we sat and waited. After waiting an hour I called back and was told that they had found a room and were cleaning it. Another hour went by and I called again, after asking them to call me when the room was ready, and they tell me that yes the room is ready. After speaking with a manager, she was going to have another manager escort us to our room. He comes up and doesn't even speak to us or apologize! He puts us in a new room. When I open up the curtains to the balcony, we went from having an ocean view to no view at all. I called down and checked out. This whole experience took four hours and was a total waist of time. When I met the manager down in the lobby when we were leaving, no apologies, they did not care one way or another if we had stayed there. We moved to the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel which had outstanding service. I strongly recommend not to stay at the Hilton Waikoloa. ", " The worst and highest priced hotel we have ever stayed at. Numerous problems (noise, bugs, dirty room, safe that would not open so we could not retreive our valuables). We received no customer service after multiple calls using their \"Perfect Vacation\" button on the phone. (Turns out that just connects you to an operator.) They wasted many hours of valuable vacation time.Assistant manager was rude, defensive, and completely unhelpful. First, she didn't return our call. Then when we called back and finally got her on the line, she implied that we were lying about our problems. We decided to immediately check out.When checking out, we mentioned that we were cutting our stay short because of problems we had. The clerk checking us out said nothing; she didn't even inquire as to what those problems were.Booked a better room for $70 less per night at the Fairmont Orchid located a few miles away. Five stars go to the Orchid. ", " Stayed 3 nights July 15-18. Nice grounds but no ocean at all. The Lagoon tower is the closest to the parking lot and we requested it. They gave it to us but with a view of the Spa roof. The pools were nice but not very clean as the water from a man made beach mixed with the pool water. I think the lack of beaches is a problem in this area and would never stay there again for that reason. Another negative factor is the food very very expensive and not very good. They have you hostage and know it. Don`t stay there! ", " We just returned from our 6 day vacation to HWV. We have two kids - ages 2 and 4 - and stayed in the Lagoon Tower.Overall, I was not impressed with this objectively impressive place. I agree that there is lots to do and it is definitely a family place. Some thoughts I wanted to share to those families thinking of staying there: 1. There is no way to easily transverse the grounds (or just get from the hotel room to the pool) if you are in a wheelchair or pushing a stroller. Stairs are everywhere and ramps are rare and/or nonexistent. We had to lift our stroller into the monorail or fold it up to go on the boat. Too much effort for a supposedly relaxing vacation. 2. There was NO recognizable poolside food or beverage service. In 6 days, no one ever came to my poolside chair. Actually, once a woman came by to say \"last call\" and we (and those sitting around us) joked about how we had never seen her before. Hilton management apparently decided on the motto: \"You want a drink, get it yourself.\" I suppose this is fine except for those whose kids need to be supervised in the pool and rounding them up out of the pool just to get a Diet Coke seems a bit much.3. There is a restaurant next to Lagoon pool but it is understaffed, infested with birds, and offers mediocre food. It routinely took over 30-45 minutes to get our food. My 2 year old accidentally dropped a plate and it took the staff, clearly annoyed, about 15 minutes after learning about it to clean it up. 4. The only restaurant near the Lagoon Tower and Pool closed at 3:30. After that, there were only 2 places to get an informal dinner at night. Both of these locations are in the Ocean Tower which is at the other end of the resort from the Lagoon Tower (4 monorail stops) (See Point #1 above). The fancier of the two , the Palm Terrace, has mediocre food and is also filled with birds who hover and fly in onto any unattended plate. It was really annoying, especially because we had to get up to go to the buffet.4. With certain exceptions, the staff was, overall, unhelpful and without a sense of humor. Example: Early one morning, I tried to do my laundry in one of the few launderetts on the premises. I ran out of quarters and the change machine was broken. I went down to the little coffee place and asked for change and they refused, telling me to see the concierge when (s)he arrived an hour later. The concierge actually arrived 2 hours later (an hour late) and, when asked, said, \"Its still broken?\" and then told me to go to the front desk for change. While this may seem sensible, the front desk is actually about a city block away. This is just one of many instances when staffpeople seemed somewhat detached from the guests and from the inconvenience of being in such a huge hotel. 5. There are beautiful trees in the center of the Lagoon Tower. Starting at about midnight, these trees become perch to what must be thousands of birds who, collectively, scream all night.6. One night, we wanted to eat somewhere other than the Palm Terrace so we headed over to the Kings Shops. THE HILTON DOES NOT OFFER A COMPLIMENTARY SHUTTLE. Instead, we had to pay some other shuttle $1 per person (including the 2 year old) to get over there. Once there, we tried to eat at the food court but it was disgusting. While the pools and lagoons are great, they are overshadowed by the logistics in getting there and being there. Overall, I felt tired navigating my way through this hotel. If I wanted to serve food and drinks to myself, push my stroller over sand and down stairs and walk all over town looking for a quarter, I would have stayed in Los Angeles. ", " We had just spent the week before at the Hilton in Waikiki. The experience was vastly different then in Waikoloa Village. I expected WV to be better than Waikiki and was surprised it wasn't even close. The atmosphere amplified all the issues I had with WV. I think the one issue that really got my goat was that no one responded for our desire to get room with a view of the sunset. Not even a peep. That is probably the biggest issue I had because we gave up this fantastic room/view in Waikiki for a view of their guys fixing the one of your swimming pools all week.(UGH!!!)Logistically, WV is tough. It's hard not to feel trapped there. I couldn't believe we had to rent a car to get to the hotel! That kind of started the whole week on a bad note. On one day, my wife forgot her camera in the room on one of our days to explore the island. It took her almost an hour to run back to the room, get the camera and return while I stewed in the car (grrr).Most of the time, I never felt the \"Aloha\" spirit in WV. It was prevalent in Waikiki, even the cleaning people in Waikiki said Aloha with a smile! For example, in Waikiki, they have this parrot that says \"Aloha\", in WV, your have a parrot that says \"Good-bye\". I think that means something!Another example...One time I asked the front desk to cash a personal check (this was the second day of our 8 day stay). Even though:1) I have been a Diamond Member with a loyal track record of almost 4 years of Hilton-family hotels2) My check had my correct address, but my driver license had an old one (we got married recently - must be common, right?)3) I didn't see any disclaimer on the website that prevented check cashing if the address didn't match driver license (I looked)4) We planned to stay there another 6 days and my check would have cleared easily by then5) The guy at the desk was not close to \"Can Do attitude\" and wouldn't even consider other options. (In fact I would say he was rude and not very helpful at all).......Luckily, my wife had an ATM card and we got money that way. (This issue still makes me mad, come to think of it.)After most of this, early in the week, I decided the only way I was going to be happy was to spend as little time/money at their hotel that I can. I wouldn't have mind paying $3.45 for a bagel, if I thought they deserved it.If your reason to go there is to stay at this place, I believe it would be a mistake. EXPLORE THE BIG ISLAND! It's better to stay away from WV and find a nice place in Kona. (At least they have Thai food there!). Go to Green Sand Beach, Volcano National Park, Mauna Kea, Kilauea, snorkel in Kona....JUST DON'T STAY at the Hilton WV. ", " If you like a Hawiian Disneyland, trams and boats are your method of navigating this ginat property........ if you like less than average food, if you want to be surrounded by convention-types, mounds of kids, and love waiting to get to your car for about 20 minutes( @ 10.50 perday)....then this is the place for you.The rooms are run down, the food is expensive...you can eat as cheaply at the lovely Four Seasons dowe the street...oh and by the way there is NOOOOOOOOOOO beach!Would not even go back for free!~ ", " We were surprised to find the hotel under rennovation and the Lagoon tower unavailable. We were stuck out in the hinterlands, 20 minute trek from the main pool area. Our kids ended up not even using the pool as it was too inconvenient to access. We spent more time at adjacent hotels (Mauna Lani Beach and Mauna Kea) as they had a clear focus on customer service.Don't make the same mistake we did!!! ", " My four year old daughter had a scoop of rice and carrot sticks for dinner one night off of the buffet, and because I had ordered off the menu they wanted to charge her $16 - to the extreme that they even called the Manager to our table who insisted we split the difference at $8.00. They charged me extra for having tomato slices on my child's plate instead of fries!!!! They wanted to charge me big $$$ for a fridge in my room for my handicapped daughter's juice - which she must have access to 24 hrs!!! The swimming pool was so cold the kids would not go in it - its not heated!!! No coffee pot in the room - have to get coffee from a cappucino wagon outside in the courtyard for $$$ per cup....A long awaited vacation turned out to be a BIG disappointment - I would not stay at any HILTON again after the bad service and the exorbitant gouging of our pocket books every time we turned around. But, hey, what really can you expect for $600 per night??? ", " After 3 stays at this hotel, the most recent being last week for 5 nights I will not return...the hotel is still a paradise but sadly the customer service is gone! Having stayed at the hotel before i was well aware of the 3 seperate towers (ocean, palace and lagoon) and had made arrangements directly with an agent at the hotel 9 months prior to stay in the palace tower which is in center of hotel grounds. I also confirmed my stay (2 rooms in palace tower ) 3 weeks prior per the hotel reservation agent instructions 9 months earlier. She assured me it was taken care of and we would have these rooms upon check in! Well, after 20 hours of traveling we checked in (7 very tired people) and were told we would be put in the ocean tower and despite my explanation of the later we were told by a manager that the hotel was overbooked...and we were lucky to be getting the rooms we were offered!!! No apologies, no offer of anything other than to take the room or we would be refunded our deposit and could go to another hotel!! I have to say, in the 20 years I have traveled to Hawaii one of the things which keeps me coming back is the wonderful treatment of the people in Hawaii. Additionally there was no housekeeping done at the kona pool during the day so after several hours you found yourself sitting amongst empty cups and food containers and it would take at least 30 minutes to get a drink. Do yourself a favor if you must visit the Big Island stay at another hotel. I have in the past recommended this hotel to many friends and business associates but based on this last experience never again. ", " This hotel is a 3 star hotel. The bathroom is very small. The coffee maker was there but you had to pay to make a coffee since they have it locked in the fridge. Why can't they charge more for the room? instead of having the guests pay for every little things that are supposed to be complimentary in a real 4 star hotel. We had a partial ocean view room by the Ocean tower which is almost a mile long from the main lobby. So incovenient to get in an out of the hotel. The tram was slow and so was the boat. It's more like a Disneyland. I guess it's good for children but definitely not a resort for adults. So noisy. The have pools for kids and adults but the adult pool closes at 6 p.m. everyday. Room service is not 24 hours. It ends at 11 p.m. The museum walk which is a mile long sounds weird because there's nothing old about the stuff they displayed. A complete disappointment. We moved to Mauna Lani hotel which is a real 5 star hotel. Will not recommend this hotel to anybody who wants a real 4 star resort. "]}}; }
